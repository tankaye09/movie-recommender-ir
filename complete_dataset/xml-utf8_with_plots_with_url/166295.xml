<plot>Egg Fight is a short documentary that explores a centuries old Southern Appalachian tradition. In a family feud older than the Hatfields and the McCoys, two Appalachian families keep alive their fighting tradition-egg fighting, that is. Stoney Creek, Tennessee is the proud home of the annual Peters Hollow Easter Egg Fight. It began almost two centuries ago as a way to settle the dispute over which family's chickens laid the hardest eggs. Today, their descendants use a variety methods and strategies in attempts to win bragging rights, and to incite battle among a new generation of fighters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166295</url></doc>
