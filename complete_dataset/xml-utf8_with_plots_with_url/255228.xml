<plot>One at a time, we meet eight members of the Dam family. I.B. Dam is a beleaguered patriarch, mopping his brow and sneezing. Mrs. Hellen Dam is loquacious. Jimmy Dam is a dandy, smoking and smirking. Miss U.B. Dam, a damsel of perhaps 20, fixes her hair and puts on a fancy hat. Miss I.P. Dam is still a kid, prancing in her new outfit. Baby Dam rubs his eyes. The Dam Cook cleans and dries a pot, and the Dam Dog leaves his post to exit stage right. It's the whole Dam family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255228</url></doc>
