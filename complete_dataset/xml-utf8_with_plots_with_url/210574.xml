<plot>Anthony "Gaspipe" Casso is portrayed as a man who is tender and loyal to his family but who ruthlessly killed or ordered the killing of scores of people, many of whom were former friends. Casso, who earned a handsome living selling drugs, robbing banks, and trafficking in stolen goods, became the reluctant leader of the Lucchese family as prosecutors moved in on the Mob bosses. When he, too, was finally captured, he eventually joined the ranks of the hated "rats" and gave prosecutors an earful, including the Mob's decision to hit John Gotti after he ordered an unapproved hit on Big Paul Castellano; how the Mafia controlled the unions; the truth behind the assassination of the Kennedys; and who killed Jimmy Hoffa.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210574</url></doc>
