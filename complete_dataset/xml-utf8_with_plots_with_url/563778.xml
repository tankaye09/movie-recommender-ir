<plot>This is in every respect a stunning picture, though somewhat bohemian in subject. It depicts in six scenes, six lively hours at New York City's famous Tenderloin dance hall, "The Haymarket." In every particular the much talked-of resort is reproduced exactly. The interior and exterior are both shown as they are. The first scene shows the opening of the hall, with the sidewalk crowds of girls and men. The second is the dance, showing the various forms of the waltz in vogue in New York. Then comes a fight in the wine room, then the eviction of the riotous young men, and finally a boisterous can-can and a raid by the police.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?563778</url></doc>
