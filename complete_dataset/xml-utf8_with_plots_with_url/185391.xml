<plot>Pastor 'George Feenstra' (qv) of Grace United Memorial Church, which is located in a working class residential neighborhood of Vancouver, decides to open the church doors continually during daylight hours so that it can be available as a sanctuary for those who need it whenever they need it. When he makes this decision, he is unaware of who will take advantage of this new service. Those considered on the lower spectrum of society - drug addicts, dealers, prostitutes and pimps - are the primary users. Regardless, the pastor considers this an essential service to integrate those in what are considered the lower classes back into mainstream society. The pastor's policy does not sit well with many of the residents of the neighborhood, who sees the pastor more of an enabler.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185391</url></doc>
