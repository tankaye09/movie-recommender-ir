<plot>Probably owing to a dose of too many movies, we usually think of gamblers either as slick, well-heeled, well-dressed studs (sometimes with a woman on each arm) or perhaps inveterate losers who haven't shaved for three days while playing with their children's savings. But there is another kind; the blue collar gambler; the guy who sets his sights, with a set of personal rules in hand, to the limited goal of making a living. For these players it's their day job, much in the way of an insurance salesman or car dealer. We meet Barry (and his wife), a math whiz with a P.H.D. who found a flaw in video poker machines. There's Lem, the septuagenarian sports handicapper who lives like a king but has never once held a "real job". And Steve, the backgammon star who has sacrificed everything for the game. These are people who would rather earn their living gambling than by any other means available. And for these blue collar guys, it's just another day at the office.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435547</url></doc>
