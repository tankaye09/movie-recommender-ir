<plot>Mirza Yusuf Changezi has known Jahan Ara since childhood, and both have been good friends. After they grow up, things are not quite the same, as Jahan Ara's dad is none other than Emperor Shah Jahan, and men are not permitted to meet with the princess under any circumstance. But Jahan and Mirza do meet secretly and promise to marry each other. Misfortune visits the emperor, when his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, passes away. The emperor's hair turns silvery overnight, and he pledges to built a memorial to his wife's name and call it Mumtaz Mahal, which will subsequently be called Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders on Earth. At her deathbed, Mumtaz had made Jahan to promise that she will look after her dad, which she does. This responsiblity makes her sacrifice her love for Mirza. Mirza is heartbroken and continues to believe that Jahan will marry him someday, sooner or later, and roams around the region looking for her, and her elusive love for him</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272738</url></doc>
