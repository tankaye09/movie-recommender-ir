<plot>Playwright David Henry Hwang talks directly to the camera about race, politics, and ... pornography. He's discovered a way to get past the typical images of Asian porn to positive images of Asian men and women caught on tape: it's "Asian Pride Porn," a videotape Mr. Hwang is pitching. We see excerpts as he talks about smart women and sexually empowered men. He urges his listeners to move from onanism to activism and never be embarrassed again when lonely and bored. He wants viewers to reach for "Asian Pride Porn" - available in sex shops and commercial centers everywhere, except Georgia and Alabama.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047972</url></doc>
