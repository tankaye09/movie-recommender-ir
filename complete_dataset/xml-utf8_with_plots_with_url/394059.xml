<plot>Did you ever go fishing? If not, this film will show you how to do it. But don't follow the example of these men, especially in the latter part of the picture. Two fishermen are sitting on a seesaw plank fishing, accompanied by their old friend the "growler," when a man approaches who engages them in conversation. Only one finally gets a bite, and becoming excited falls into the water. The board naturally tilts, throwing his companion after him, and they struggle to keep afloat, much to the amusement of the man on shore. This is a good and snappy picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394059</url></doc>
