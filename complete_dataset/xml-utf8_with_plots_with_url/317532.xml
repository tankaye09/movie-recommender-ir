<plot>Ladies is a collage of the experience and emotions of women and girls from 1904 to the present day, the hidden histories to be found in an Edwardian Ladies Public Cloakroom. Each scene features a different character as she experiences moments of intimacy, crisis or transformation. Scenes and time periods flow freely into each other, allusive and playful in the connections that are made. The lavatory attendant is a central unseen presence, each object she finds has a story of how it came to be there. The attendant becomes the invisible curator of her own personal museum. At the end of the film, a beautiful shrine of lost property is discovered hidden in the attendant's rest room, documenting the arbitrary traces and memories left behind from a range of visitors over the past hundred years. Ladies - a public location, private acts, ladies come and go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317532</url></doc>
