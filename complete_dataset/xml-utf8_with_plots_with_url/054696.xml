<plot>"Baby Jamz: Daily Lessons and Jamz Sessions" is a 62-minute, educational "sing-along" experience developed as an extension to the successful Baby Jamz Toys line. Featuring modern-day, beat-driven versions of classic children's songs such as "Twinkle, Twinkle," "Wheels on the Bus" and "Old MacDonald," the program is centered upon Music World Kids' successful Baby Jamz Audio CD, Executive Produced by Mathew and Solange Knowles, with performances by the artists of Music World Entertainment. Solange also makes a special cameo appearance in the DVD which features her son Julez. The DVD features the animated characters "Beatz" and "Myk" who are modeled after the Baby Jamz Microphone and Music Boom Box toys. Beatz and Myk spend a day with their special friends Julez, Carlos, Jasmine and Simon. The characters, who alternate between animated and live action worlds, join us in singing songs, learning shapes, letters, numbers and colors, exploring making music with their own bodies and modeling good behavior like healthy eating and picking up after themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054696</url></doc>
