<plot>A wonderful and perfect picture of this great Winter sport in Canada. A number of skiers are going down hill at a terrific speed. They jump a hurdle of snow on their way to the foot of the incline. Nearly all of the jumpers fall to the ground in a heap after taking the hurdle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?500196</url></doc>
