<plot>The world of acting is a difficult one and watching actors struggle can be entertaining. Shae Maddox is a struggling actor trying to make it in the world of acting. His unusual assistant, who is also his friend, is there the whole time trying to help him along the way. The two quarrel over money and lucky underwear which eventually leads to a role reversal. Mark sabotages Shae and beats him out on a part and eventually makes it bigger than Shae.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632844</url></doc>
