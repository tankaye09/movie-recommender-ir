<plot>A conjurer appears upon the stage with a small ordinary wooden table. Waving his hands, the heads of three men appear in succession upon the surface of the table, the bodies being entirely invisible. Pipes and cigars are handed to the heads and they begin smoking furiously, the smoke rising in great clouds, the heads in the meantime making humorous grimaces. The conjurer then throws two of the heads in the air, when they disappear, but the third is thrown upon the floor and suddenly becomes attached to the body of a giantess. The conjurer attempts to make love to her, but he is thrown violently to the floor. Upon recovering, by a wave of his hand, the conjuror makes the huge and ugly woman disappear in a cloud of smoke.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573469</url></doc>
