<plot>The play's the thing. In discomfort, the usually self-confident Max visits a psychiatrist. After a long and celibate relationship with Carrie, an actress, she has finally agreed to sleep with him, but he fails to rise to the occasion. During his time with the shrink, Max discloses the details of the night in question and what led up to it, particularly an ill-fated dinner where he meets Carrie's family. More questions from the shrink lead us to suspect surprising roots to his performance anxiety. The shrink encourages Max to find Carrie - he knows where she is performing. Will they reconnect?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?495072</url></doc>
