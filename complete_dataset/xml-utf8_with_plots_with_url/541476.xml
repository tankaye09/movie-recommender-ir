<plot>Happy mothers and fathers carrying their little ones are following a large band. Some babies are laughing, others are crying, while more are bewildered, and appear to be in doubt as to whether they should laugh or cry. One young man passes with twins, another has his youngster on his shoulders with papa's hat on, and it is amusing to see the little one trying to remove the troublesome headgear. All the babies are held high as they pass. Very interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541476</url></doc>
