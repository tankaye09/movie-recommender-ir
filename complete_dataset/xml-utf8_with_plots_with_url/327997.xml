<plot>The elderly widower is tired. He is lonely. His spirit is broken. Old comforts no longer provide solace. After witnessing a single tragic event, the widower embarks on a deeply personal journey to re-discover what has been missing all along. Magical, lyrical and quietly powerful, "Leaving" invites the viewer to consider what is meaningful to them and what they could not live without.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327997</url></doc>
