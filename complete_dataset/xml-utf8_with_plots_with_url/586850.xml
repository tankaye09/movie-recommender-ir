<plot>Remade by Trem Carr and Paul Malvern's "Lone Star Productions" in 1935 as "Desert Trail" starring John Wayne.Cowhand Steve Kendall(Bob Steele) and slick eastern confidence man "Boston" Harry Manners(Ted Adams)become friends but are rivals for the hand of fair Juanita(Josephine Velez), a girl whose hands are influenced by whoever deposited the last trinket in them. Nikkos(Al Bridge) deposits a trinket from a robbery/murder committed by he and Bud Warren(Eddie Fetherston), but Juanita, when pressed, points the finger at Boston Harry, as it is hard for a girl such as Juanita who gets many trinkets to keep up with just who, among the general population, added to her trinket collection and when.The locals are about to string Harry up but he is saved by Steve and they light out for friendlier surroundings in another town. There, they meet storekeeper Ma Warren(Florence Turner) and her pretty daughter Sally(Frances Morris) and Steve and Harry start vieing for her attentions, with Steve in the lead after he sings "I Fell in Love With You" to her, and Harry hasn't much to counter with as Sally is not a trinket-favoring girl.But not all is well, for Sally's brother Bud is also part of the family storekeeping business, when he isn't pulling robberies in near-by towns with his accented partner Nikkos, and he begins to fret over the possibility that Steve and Harry will learn that he was part of the affair in the other town that led to Steve and Harry's hasty departure. Nikkos has a plan to ensure that doesn't happen. (This film's leading lady, Frances Morris,died on December 2, 2003 in Santa Clarita, Ca. at the age of 98.She had a long and varied career in films and television, including many B-westerns in the 1930's, and as "Sarah Kent" on the first television episode of the "Superman" series starring George Reeves.She was first married to silent-film actor Russell Parker and later to Antrim Short.)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586850</url></doc>
