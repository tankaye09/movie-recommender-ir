<plot>Junior League of Raleigh to Host North Carolina's 2005 Inaugural Ball Events will celebrate newly elected governor, Council of State RALEIGH, (December 8, 2004) - The 1600 member Junior League of Raleigh is planning the 2005 Inaugural Ball for the governor, lieutenant governor and the members of the Council of State. The League, which is the only Junior League in the country to sponsor an inaugural ball, has hosted North Carolina's since 1933. This year's events will take place Jan. 14 and 15. Friday's events include a luncheon for First Lady Mary Easley and a reception for Lieutenant Governor Beverly Perdue. A reception, gala presentation and ball honoring Governor Mike Easley will be held Saturday evening, January 15. "The Junior League of Raleigh is privileged to help North Carolina celebrate its newly elected and re-elected officials," said Susan McAllister, Junior League of Raleigh president. "For 75 years our League has been committed to training volunteers to improve the community. The funds generated by the Inaugural Ball festivities will help us further this important mission and continue to make a difference in the lives of many North Carolina citizens." Proceeds from past balls have funded programs and projects sponsored by the Junior League of Raleigh in Wake County and statewide, including Communities in Schools of North Carolina, Heritage Park Community Learning Center and SAFEchild. This year's theme "North Carolina Firsts" highlights the state's unique firsts including: the first state-funded art museum in the country in Raleigh, the first Pepsi - created and served in New Bern in 1898 and the famous "first flight" in Kitty Hawk in 1903. The events will feature many of the state's prominent musicians and entertainers, and food will be provided by numerous North Carolina vendors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?538121</url></doc>
