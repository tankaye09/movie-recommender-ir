<plot>The picture shows a number of cow-boys rounding up a herd of wild horses and driving them into an enclosure where they can count them without difficulty and then brand them. After the horses are all counted, they are lassoed and taken into a section of the enclosure which is spread with straw. Here they are thrown to the ground and branded. After the branding the animals jump to their feet and kick around in a lively manner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411034</url></doc>
