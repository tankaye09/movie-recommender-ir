<plot>Trevor drives around Boston picking up test tubes of blood and delivering them to a lab. Meter maids are the bane of his existence. Parking tickets stack up in his glove box. Out of frustration, he tags a meter maid with a paint ball. He does it a few more times, and soon "the meter maid sniper" is famous all over town. There are protests against "quarters only" parking meters, there are sniper disciples (who put quarters in expired meters before the meter maids can issue a citation). Trevor starts to hallucinate, obsesses, and when he learns of sniper copycats, decides to escalate the attacks. Can anything bring him to his senses?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185696</url></doc>
