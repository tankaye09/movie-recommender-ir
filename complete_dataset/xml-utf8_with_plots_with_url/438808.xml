<plot>Cartoonist Eddie Gough wakes up with a terrible headache and a deadline. After being nagged by his mother he heads out to work only to get stuck in traffic. When he finally arrives, his boss/ex-girlfriend berates him for not being able to produce any work and Eddie turns it into an evaluation of their relationship. With nothing accomplished, Eddie leaves and a bump starts to form on his head. While driving home, he talks to his friend Henry, who attempts to get him to go to a party against his own wants. Eddie makes it home and spends most of the afternoon trying to come up with ideas for work as his headache grows. Sketching to no avail, Eddie decides to go to the party, where he is consumed by his headache and takes no interest in his friends. After a brief confrontation ensues in regard to leaving the party so soon, the headache overwhelms Eddie as he stumbles home only to find that he had know idea what was in store for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?438808</url></doc>
