<plot>From the Rhode Island International Film Festival: In late autumn, a group of young intellectuals discuss love and aging at a cottage lake house. Bored by the banter, one young man drifts into reverie. What proceeds is an absurd but deeply introspective examination of his own essence. Playing tour guide, he takes the audience through his own disintegration as an old man. Hints of his past loom about in the form of him as a young boy. And a beautiful woman emanates a relinquished love - or love relinquished. All this, and eventually his own death, must play out in front of the dismissive narrator. Cinematic conventions like time, space and identity are challenged in this intriguing blend of nonsense and philosophy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134125</url></doc>
