<plot>Our hero is Nigel, a middle aged wage slave with a developing drink problem, a lonely fantasist still haunted by his long failed marriage. Seemingly invisible to his colleagues and desperate to reconnect with the world, he discovers the passionate and vibrant Salsa scene and plunges in head first, soon to be reborn as....Salsa Guy! Moving through a colourful odyssey of lessons, clubs and bars, Salsa Guy is awoken from his turgid half-life, but what begins as a hobby gradually turns into an obsession, which sees his life spin out of control, leading to a flamboyant and tragic demise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474883</url></doc>
