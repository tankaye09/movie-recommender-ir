<plot>A young woman, Oui, shows up on the doorstep of a printing house run by her stern Aunt Bua. Oui, whose parents were killed in a drive-by shooting, has no place else to go. She is given the task of caring for her aunt's grandson, a young boy named Arm, who sees ghosts and seems traumatized by something his previous nanny did to him. Additionally, Oui suffers from hallucinations, brought on by the trauma of seeing her parents killed. And Aunt Bua, it turns out, is some sort of mystic. With the Thai government's drug war of 2003-04 as a subtext, this is a strange ghost story with many threads that are somehow tied together in a suspenseful manner before the ending.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433940</url></doc>
