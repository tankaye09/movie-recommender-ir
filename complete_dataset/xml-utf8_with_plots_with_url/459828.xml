<plot>Ever since it became the future, underground twister tournaments have become the bloodsport of choice. When Lance Van Brockington's sister is killed in a match, he has to venture deep into the world off all female Twister death matches to find the truth. His first stop on his journey is Portugal, where he has to convince his sister's Twister trainer, an eye-patched femme fatale named Barokio, that he can succeed where his sister failed. Then he's off to the tournament, where a surprise twist by the Evil Portuguese Government seals his fate. Funny, bizarre, and at times touching, "Remember the Future" is sure to leave you... well, probably just leave you. It's rude like that.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459828</url></doc>
