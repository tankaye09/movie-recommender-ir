<plot>An ABC News Special -- A tribute to John Wayne, broadcast the night after his death from cancer, age 72. He was born Marion Michael Morrison, but to all he was known as "The Duke". He starred in so many movies he'd lost count after the 200th--many memorable classics, others, forgettable quickies. Virtually all had one thing in common--he was the fearless good guy who knew how do get things done, either in a world war or in the wild west.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243708</url></doc>
