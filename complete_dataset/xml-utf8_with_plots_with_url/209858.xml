<plot>Nines Ranks is a no-nonsense female drug dealer in Philadelphia. With the help of her sister Tee, and female Gangsta Grrlz she bails out of prison, Ninea plans to make a mint in the drug game. Unfortunately in this male dominated business, Ninea is constantly tested, but comes through with flying colors...or should I say... bullets. On the other side of town is Dion... her competition. The two are constantly pushing the lines to gain more territory. After Dion is murdered by an ambitious underling, Ninea refuses a deal from the new boss to join their businesses together. Harsh words between the two fuel the battle to see who will be left standing to run both neighborhoods.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209858</url></doc>
