<plot>This is the historic concert Luciano Pavarotti gave at the magnificent Olympia Hall in Munich, Germany. The world's greatest tenor thrills the audience by singing many of his most requested arias and songs including his famous interpretation of "Vesti la giubba" as well as his popular favorite "Mamma". Pavarotti responds to the encore calls by singing such favorites as "O sole mio" and "Torno a Sorrento".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346423</url></doc>
