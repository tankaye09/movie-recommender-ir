<plot>Seethalakshmi was born in an uprooted tribal family, now settled on the banks of a river in North Kerala, India. She grew up adhering to the traditionally well-defined roles of a girl child in the society that gave prominence to male children. About three years back, she discovered a strange transformation she had been undergoing. Her sexuality was in an ambiguous flux, and she was slowly becoming a male child. Later the feminine self in her slowly vanished and she was 're-born' a male child, now re-christened Sreedharan. With the transforming sexuality and gender relationship he had a re-defined role in his family and society.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042150</url></doc>
