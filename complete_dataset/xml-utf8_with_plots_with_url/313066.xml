<plot>"La Pared", defies the Mexican concept of "Macho" as it explores the nature of human instinct and the concept of action and reaction. Miguel finds himself struggling against the gossip he hears about his wife and at the same time trying to uphold the image other people have created of him within society, "He's the man". As he finally confronts Dolores they both realize that the opinion of others has led them to this defining moment in which both of them have to redefine themselves and be honest of who they are and what the want, leaving behind pre-manufactured labels of "husband and wife", and "man and woman".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?313066</url></doc>
