<plot>For the past 45 years, drama teacher Charlotte Brown has been making a difference with her students. She has built a nationally recognized theater department, received numerous "Teacher of the Year" awards and has had many former students become movie stars, politicians, lawyers, college professors, and writers for film and television. "RISE and SHINE" follows a year in the life of Ms. Brown's current high school drama students and explores the phenomenon of speech and debate tournaments where she has coached many state champions. Journey with a one-of-a-kind teacher and her talented students as they prepare for a successful life and find out what it takes to be part of a winning team.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?464238</url></doc>
