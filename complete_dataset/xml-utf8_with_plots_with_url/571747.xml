<plot>In "The Livelong Day," we see three generations of train enthusiasts gather to pilot one of the largest, most obsessively realistic model railroads in the world. Their play is work, as they take eight hour shifts piloting the trains through detailed schedules recreating journeys taken decades before. They are nostalgics and romantics, mourning the vanishing of railroad culture and craftsmanship while striving to maintain it at 1/87 scale.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?571747</url></doc>
