<plot>Presented as a comment on the lifestyle of Bombay's rich, the film tells of the wealthy Mr. Nanavati (Sandow) who is attracted to a dancer, Roshanara (Yakbal) who in turn is represented by a Dalal Chhotalal (Noor Mohammed). Chhotalal plans to rob Nanavati and seizes his chance when the rich man buys a gold necklace as a present for his daughter's birthday. Chhotalal tempts Nanavati to visit Roshanara, who then seduces him and obtains the necklace. When Nanavati realizes that he has been duped, he accuses Chhotalal, who has by then switched the necklace for a fake. Roshanara, was based upon a real cabaret dancer of that name.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374533</url></doc>
