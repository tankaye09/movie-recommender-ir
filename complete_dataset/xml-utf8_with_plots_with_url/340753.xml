<plot>A fellow in a wide-brimmed hat, with a willowy stick for a rod and a baited hook, sits down on a plank hanging over a bridge above a stream. He sticks the rod under his seat and picks up his bottle to take a swig. Behind him creeps a joker who removes the large flagstone that's holding the fisherman's plank in place: man, rod, bait, and plank fall into the water. As the joker laughs and tosses the flagstone into the water, the fisherman complains then makes his way to shore. A horse-drawn buggy draws up, stops, and a fellow gets off the buggy and he too laughs. His female companion stays in the buggy and laughs too. The joker jumps in.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340753</url></doc>
