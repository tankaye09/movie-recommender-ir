<plot>"A very effective snow scene. Beacon Street is lined on one side by the large elms, which in this picture are heavily laden with snow. The street is piled high with drifts, and the magnificent residences are scarcely discernible through their thick coverings of snow. A number of sleighing parties lend animation to the scene."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162385</url></doc>
