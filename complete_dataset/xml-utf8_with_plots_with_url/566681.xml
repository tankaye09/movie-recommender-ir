<plot>A party of four young ladies are seen enjoying a little picnic along a quiet stream when they are suddenly surprised by a "Knight of the Road." They jump up from the many delicacies spread on a snow white table cloth lying on the ground, and make for the wood, screaming at the top of their voices. Their screams attract the attention of a couple of gentlemen who are passing, and they come to the assistance of the girls. They proceed to give the hobo a much needed bath. The splash when he is thrown in the stream would have done justice to an elephant. They then pelt him with sandwiches, bottles, etc. A very amusing and laughable picture and a sure winner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566681</url></doc>
