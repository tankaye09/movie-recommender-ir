<plot>A modern parable about three brothers whom life has divided as they each went their separate ways. Of their happy childhood and adolescent years together, only a black-and-white photograph remains, capturing the three young men at a table in front of their family home, and memories of the glasshouse that was their father's pride. The youngest brother is now trying to seek the meaning of a dream in which he meets up once more with his two older brothers whom he hasn't seen for years. The oldest is married but longs vainly for a child. The middle son has focused his life on spiritual meditation, and the youngest rises up against any form of authority. The conflicts, ill will and mutual lack of understanding are veiled by images of the times the boys swam in the sea together and built sandcastles. But there is still a little love left, which cannot be destroyed entirely, nor driven from the hearts of people once so tightly bound.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087148</url></doc>
