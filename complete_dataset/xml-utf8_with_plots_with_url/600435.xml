<plot>The Nac Mac Feegle are only a few inches tall, blue, red haired, kilt-wearing, ne'er-do-wells who will steal anything that isn't nailed down. Strike that. They'll steal anything... and the nail. They drink, they fight, they head-butt or kick just about everything that moves, and they speak in a Scottish brogue ("Ach! Crivens!"). And with all that going for them, it's no wonder that they turn out to be the bravest, most loyal, and aggravating friends a girl can have. Tiffany Aching is barely into her adolescence, but when the Faerie queen steals her younger brother, she's not about to let being young stop her. Armed with little more than a frying pan, her common sense, and a gaggle of Nac Mac Feegles, Tiffany invades Faerieland in a quest to get back what's hers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600435</url></doc>
