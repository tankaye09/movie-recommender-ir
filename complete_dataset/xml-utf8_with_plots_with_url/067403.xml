<plot>Yoko's cat Yuki hasn't shown up for diner and this really concerns her as the cat never misses a meal. She starts looking, asking neighbors if they have seen the animal. Then, one boy mentions seeing Yuki around the 'Haunted House', further up in the city. It's a favorite playground of the boy's group of friends. Yoko soon finds out this isn't an ordinary place. Objects are disappearing, feathers turns into birds and gravity seems to be absent. But Yoko soon finds out the existence of the place is also known by a group of rather reckless people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067403</url></doc>
