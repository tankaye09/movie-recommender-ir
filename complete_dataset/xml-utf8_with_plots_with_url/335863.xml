<plot>LIFE OR BREATH is a darkly comedic thriller about MARTIN WALLACE, a middle aged engineer who absolutely despises his wife, MYRA. After twenty years of marriage, she has transformed into an overweight, unloving, materialistic woman who dominates Martin's very existence. However, due to an unexpected accident, Myra's now hooked up to a life support ventilator. With Myra incapacitated, Martin sees that his life is quickly slipping away as he sits idly at her bedside, abiding to her every whim, while secretly hoping that she dies. In his quest for freedom from Myra's overbearing containment, Martin decides to evaluate other options. One other option. Murder Myra and salvage what remains of his own life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335863</url></doc>
