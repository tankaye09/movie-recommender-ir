<plot>Box Number documents Ani Kalemkerian's interviews with men and woman who have used phone dating services. The subjects speak candidly of their experiences and thoughts on meeting others from a telephone chat line, and the consequences involved in that process. In the early 90's, Kalemkerian noticed the proliferation of phone dating businesses advertising in newsweeklies. She began videotaping her meetings from 1993 until 1999 as a response to her curiosity and understant people's motives that lead to advertise their private thoughts in a public venue. Videotaped entirely in fast food restaurants and coffee shops where people consume and quickly leave, Box Number examines how the social environments of these men and women has moved from the urban space to the telephone where, like fast food restaurants, you can fulfill any desire instantly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080917</url></doc>
