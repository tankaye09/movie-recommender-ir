<plot>"'Tis better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all" -Alfred Lord Tennyson - "Yeah right!" -Anyone who has loved and lost - What would you do for the person you love? How far would you go? What would you give up for true love? Things that are romantic in fairy tales can be creepy in real life. Would you wait patiently while your princess lived in exile in her ivory tower? For months? For years? Would you hike the highest mountain? How about with a broken leg - carrying an 85lb back pack - for a week? Based on a true story, The Obsession is a dark musical about falling in love, breaking up, dealing with loss, and trying to win back the love of your life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579882</url></doc>
