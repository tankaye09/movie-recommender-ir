<plot>Angus Petfarkin is very, very talented... and very, very troubled. His life is a mess. His career's at a standstill. It's been years since he's finished a painting. Even his brother the art dealer is ready to give up on him. And there's something really, really scary living in his closet. But then a mysterious woman walks in through his studio door... Modern notions about art, fame, family, commerce, academia, success, love - even the nature of time itself - are all skewered in this most unusual comedy. A funny and touching portrait of the artist as a middle-aged misfit still searching for his place in the world. Maybe there's hope in the future after all... even for a guy like Angus.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040601</url></doc>
