<plot>Two burglars with full kit of tools are seen attacking an office safe, but do not succeed in forcing the time lock or opening the door. While the burglars are still trying to force the lock the janitor enters and they, unperceived, hide behind the safe. Apparently the janitor knows the combination and opens the safe without difficulty, taking from it a supply of coal with which he fills the scuttle in his hand. The janitor departs and the burglars emerge and fall on the floor in a faint at the wasted labor they have bestowed upon forcing an entrance into a safe full of coal. The entire film is comical in the extreme.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222281</url></doc>
