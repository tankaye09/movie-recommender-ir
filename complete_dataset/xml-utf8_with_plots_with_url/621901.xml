<plot>Twice Today is a highly metaphorical journey into the last moments of Joe Oliver. A man who is paralyzed from the waist down and at the end of his rope. As he ponders escape from his tragic and guilt-ridden past, he sits with a pistol on his lap and takes one last moment to reflect on the events that have culminated to his despair. These events are displayed through the lives of some small town citizens. In particular, the stories are related through the tales of four separate groups; two grade-school bullies rebelling against all that is good, a group of three dishonest teenagers who spend all of their earnings on drugs, a young couple whose relationship is on shaky ground due to dishonesty between the two, and a mother and daughter moving back to the mother's hometown in which the daughter is having difficulty coping with the idea of her parents getting a divorce. It is through the tales of these groups that the town becomes a macrocosm for Joe's own life; the events in his life are shown as repeating in the lives of the current town residents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621901</url></doc>
