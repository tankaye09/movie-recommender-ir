<plot>"Testing Hope: Grade 12 in the new South Africa" chronicles the lives of four young people in Nyanga township, just outside Cape Town, as they work towards their crucial Matric exams, which one student calls "the decider." These students began school in 1994, the same year apartheid ended and Nelson Mandela became president. While this is the new South Africa, many vestiges of apartheid persist. "Testing Hope" follows the students as they prepare for the exams which they believe will determine their future. It explores what hangs in the balance if students pass Matric and what awaits those who do not. How do they achieve their dreams in a country where so many obstacles remain?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536605</url></doc>
