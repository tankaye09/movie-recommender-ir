<plot>Bhairavi, a renowned singer, sees a revolutionary Sandeep badly injured and takes him home for treatment. Sandeep had left his father Upendra as Sandeep had taken to terrorism. He hated women and music, but Bhairavi's company mellowed him and he fell in love with her. She was, however, a mother of Kajvi by a spouse Avinash who had ditched her. Kajri started living with Upendra and their affection turned into love. Avinash, who had been suffering from blood cancer, suddenly returned before Bhairavi was to marry Sandeep. These unusual marriages were now averted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168337</url></doc>
