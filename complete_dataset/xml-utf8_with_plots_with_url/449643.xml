<plot>After running away from home, Prince Naresh Kumar Singh (Dev Anand) now calls himself Dilip Singh, returns home after a period of 18 years. He travels by ship, and meets Reeta Singh (Saira Banu), and after a series of misunderstandings, both fall in love with each other. When Dilip reaches Devangarh, he is shocked to find that his brother, Rana Mahesh Kumar Singh (Murad) is dead; his mother, Rajmata Rajeshwari (Durga Khote) is blind; and the throne-prince to be crowned is the Senapati Uday Singh (Premnath), who has also killed Naresh. Rajmata is convinced that her son Naresh is still alive, and will return one day, and refuses to permit Uday to ascend the throne. In order to fool the Rajmata, Uday recruits Dilip to pose as the missing prince, Naresh. How long will Uday Singh continue to pull wool over the eyes of the Rajmata? Will Dilip alias Naresh Singh survive long enough to ascend the throne, and reveal his true identity?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?449643</url></doc>
