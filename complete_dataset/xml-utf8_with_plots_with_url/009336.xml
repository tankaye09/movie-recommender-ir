<plot>An intimate look at a Pakistani family's struggle with tradition and social change as they celebrate the engagement of their two eldest children - one an arranged marriage and the other a "love" marriage. The Mughals are a middle class family often living in Quetta, one of Pakistan's most culturally conservative cities. The two eldest children, Ilyas and Yasmin, are celebrating their engagements during the same week. But the two could not be more different. Ilyas is following tradition and marrying a woman he has never met. Yasmin, his sister, is determined to make her own decisions. She has chosen her own fiance, although getting her family's approval was not easy. Sibling rivalry, disapproving neighbors and lively family debate punctuate this up-close look at a family undergoing social change.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009336</url></doc>
