<plot>A 'White Elephant' can be an article no longer wanted by its owner. It's also an endeavor that turns out to be a conspicuous failure. The film addresses both. During Thanksgiving weekend, Jeremy Bentley, a young college freshman comes home to celebrate with his modern, progressive family: brothers Ron and Elliot, sister Susan and his parents. While fending off the advances of his step-mother Abigail and the disappointment of his father, Jonah in his dropping out of environmental studies, he reveals his true political leanings. His gay brother Elliot ironically becomes his only support when family hysteria erupts. The film is a satire that reverses stereotypes and seeks to show people as individuals rather than being defined merely by symbols or labels which are so common in popular culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654532</url></doc>
