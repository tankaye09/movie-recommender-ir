<plot>Driving an Arab Street takes the viewer on a journey along the "Arab street," a monolithic term pundits use to describe Arab sentiment, to find out what people are actually saying about the West and America. The film follows Egyptian taxi drivers as they navigate the streets of Cairo and share their diverse perspectives on American and Egyptian society, culture, politics and the relationship between these two civilizations. Driving an Arab Street is Arthur Hurley's first documentary film. He first went to Egypt in 1999 to study Arabic at the American University in Cairo. After working briefly as a reporter in California, Hurley returned to Cairo to work as a freelance writer, continue his Arabic studies and make a documentary that would give insight into Arab and Western relations. He is currently pursuing a Masters in Film at American University.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160402</url></doc>
