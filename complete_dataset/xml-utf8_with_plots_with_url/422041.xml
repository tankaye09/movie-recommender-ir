<plot>There is no more romantic piece of scenery in Pennsylvania, and this locality has become a famous and favorite resort for summer visitors. From start to finish the scenes are most enchanting, and when the base of Mt. Pisgah is reached the observation cars are drawn to the top of the mountain, up an incline two thousand three hundred and twenty-two feet long, and rising six hundred and sixty-four feet. When the summit is reached the cars proceed on their journey, propelled by gravity, amid scenes which are truly picturesque. Truly a fine piece of photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422041</url></doc>
