<plot>A panel attempts to guess unusual objects submitted by viewers; as with "What's My Line?," the item was shown to the in-person audience and the home viewer, but not to the panel. The panel then asked questions about the item; each question asked raised the "retail value" (up to $150). Once the item was guessed correctly, three additional questions were asked; if all three questions were correctly answered, the item's "value" was tripled, and awarded to the at-home seller.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254795</url></doc>
