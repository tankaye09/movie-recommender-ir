<plot>Going from small town prairie life to a youth spent in the cockpit changed Jim forever, and his passion for "his" Liberator has never left him. Unfortunately, his Squadron has seemed to disappear from the record, and from the minds of fellow veterans, a fact which saddens the members of the squadron, but one to which they were resigned. "Quiet Heroes" is the heart-warming story of a daughter's quest to honour the wartime flying career of her WWII veteran father and his crew and squadron mates. "Quiet Heroes" quickly became one of the most popular Remembrance Day tributes in recent years, and airs every year on November 11th all across Canada.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452120</url></doc>
