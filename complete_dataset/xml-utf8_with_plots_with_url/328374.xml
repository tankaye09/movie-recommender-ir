<plot>Danny Malone took off to Colorado to live the private, artist's life he found impossible in Chicago. His best friend, Tommy 'Fudd' Phelan also left, but did so as a Marine. Thirteen years later, Danny discovers that he may have cancer and leaves Colorado abruptly under the guise of re-connecting with Fudd, who is returning from his service in Iraq. Knowing that he'll need health insurance, Danny asks his well-connected Father to help him find a job back in Chicago. Throughout his stay, Danny doesn't share his dire news with friends and family in an attempt to hide his vulnerability. He soon finds that this defensiveness is dangerously alienating him from friends, family and the girl he's falling in love with. He comes to realize that true happiness can only be found in community. Meanwhile, Fudd comes to find that the community to which he came home is no longer his and decides to return to the only place where he had found meaning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328374</url></doc>
