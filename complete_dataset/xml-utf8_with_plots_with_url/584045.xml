<plot>David is a harried music producer who does not appreciate his stepsons Brandon and Brody (birth father being Olympic decathlete Bruce Jenner) constantly living off his dime. At times, his wife Linda acts like a third child by enabling their behavior. While David routinely tries to get the "princes" to do their fair share, more often than not it fails. And more often than not their pal Spencer is an accomplice to the shenanigans. Nevertheless, the boys manage to wriggle their way out of trouble through the magic of humor. Although it airs on the same network (Fox) as does The Simple Life (from which it clearly took its cue), it is not produced by the same company.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584045</url></doc>
