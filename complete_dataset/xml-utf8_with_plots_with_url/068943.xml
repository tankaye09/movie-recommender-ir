<plot>Five is giving undiscovered artists the chance to show they're the next Damien Hirst or John Constable in a nationwide competition, Big Art Challenge, which carries a prize of Â£10,000 for the lucky winner. Judges Brian Sewell, Wayne Hemingway and Jane Wilson are continuing to find it difficult to find common ground as they champion three very different opinions of what constitutes great art. This third programme is filmed in the Lowry Gallery, a relatively young gallery which is set in a magnificent waterside location at the heart of the redeveloped Salford Quays in Greater Manchester.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068943</url></doc>
