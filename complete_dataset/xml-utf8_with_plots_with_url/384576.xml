<plot>My Narmada Travels is a 22-minute documentary film about an untouched people in a land that's slowly sinking beneath the waters of development. The remote village of Domkhedi, in India, is being submerged by the Sardar Sarovar Dam, located 30 miles downstream. The dam is being built as part of an aggressive plan by the Indian government to bring over 24 million people water and power. The problem is, over 500,000 indigenous people face displacement as a result of the dam. Told from a personal perspective, the filmmaker gets to know both the people and government officials--she takes viewers through a journey of discovery, constantly wondering: what is the price of progress?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384576</url></doc>
