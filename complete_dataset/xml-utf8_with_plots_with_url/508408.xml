<plot>A documentary completely produced within 48-hours for the Elevate Film Festival. The Subject: The South Central Farmers dispel the myth that the poor are poor because they are lazy. Many of the South Central Farmers work more than one job, and then farm the land at 41st and Long Beach Avenue. They grow staples such as corn, tomatoes, cactus, and other Meso-American foods unavailable elsewhere in Los Angeles. They even grow their own medicinal herbs. The South Central Farmers provide fresh foods and a healthy alternative to the working poor. They have found a creative way to feed families without "welfare." Now, they have been threatened with losing their land to a wealthy developer who wants to build a warehouse on their spot.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?508408</url></doc>
