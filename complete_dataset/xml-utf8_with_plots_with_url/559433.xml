<plot>Upon the death of his father, LA club promoter, John Funk, returns to his Connecticut hometown to take over the dying family mortuary. His arrival resurrects the festering resentment of his dutiful younger brother and small town grudges related to the death of his high school sweetheart years earlier. John seeks comfort in a mysterious ex-lover, Sophie. But while re-igniting his romance with her, he uncovers a string of corpses whose various undoings date back to his youth. The skeletons emerging from John's closet soon invite the scrutiny of a local detective with his own bone to pick. In order to put the past to rest, John must ultimately choose between the love of his life and life itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559433</url></doc>
