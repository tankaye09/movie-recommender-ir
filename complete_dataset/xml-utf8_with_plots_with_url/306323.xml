<plot>Lenny, a drug dealer, and his wife Norma are not getting along. She's tired of his unfaithfulness, but instead of just leaving him, she takes a lot of cash. She has a boyfriend, Tony, who is also the headliner at a drag queen cabaret. The two of them enlist the help of Brent, another cross-dresser: Brent will hide the loot in his dress while Tony and Norma make arrangements for the three of them to leave for Vegas. But Lenny's on their trail, with his moll who's also armed. Meanwhile, the Seattle police are baffled: murder victims are turning up, strangled by jock straps or pantyhose. Can Norma and her pals escape Lenny? And who's doing all the killing?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?306323</url></doc>
