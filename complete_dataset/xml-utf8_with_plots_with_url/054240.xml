<plot>Babbage is a short film that introduces us to the inventor and prolific thinker Charles Babbage, a man both famous for inventing the first computer and failing to build it. The film takes place at a dinner somewhere in the early Victorian period. Babbage introduces the guests to us one by one, each playing a significant role in the colorful life of our host. The conversation ranges from topical debate to pleasant reminiscences until we are plunged into Babbage's isolation and despair as he reveals to the audience that the guests are fragmented memories of those he loved and lost, many of them never met, never spoke. Babbage's final chapter is one of solitude and perceived failure, an uncelebrated genius who deserves a place in history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054240</url></doc>
