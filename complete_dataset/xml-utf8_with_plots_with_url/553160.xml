<plot>One of the very fine mystical pictures. The scene represents the Devil's Kitchen with the Devil's cook at work. As the different kettles are placed upon the fire, various hobgoblins of every description jump out in front of the cook. A little hunchback bobs out of the kettle of potatoes, and fires at the cook point blank with a miniature gun which emits an immense cloud of smoke. Pandemonium reigns in the kitchen from the start to the finish of the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553160</url></doc>
