<plot>Bench At The Edge is a surrealistic black comedy that celebrates the gift of life through the loss of life. Held to his comatose body in a hospital bed by a long life support tube, Man One continues to live out a twenty five-year life support existence at the edge of an abyss. Over the years he has seen many a man and woman fling themselves into eternity. The "bullets" that make quick decisions and jump particularly fascinate him. Now Man Two appears as a distraught husband over the infidelity of his wife. They begin an encounter riddled with humor and empathy for the human condition and the pros and cons of life and death. As the ticking bomb pressure builds, other "bullets" interrupt the challenge Man One has encountered with Man Two's thorough "contemplation." As the edge looms closer and closer, a fight over cutting the life line to Man One thrusts the audience into a hard look at their own sense of life's challenge and the question of its value.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065124</url></doc>
