<plot>A freak summer storm traps ten unsuspecting strangers in a coffee shop along the coast. Suddenly a mysterious green mist rolls in. One by one, the strangers are being eaten alive by a Creature they cannot see. The truth is beyond anyone's wildest imagination. A sea creature long since thought extinct has survived the ice age and reawakened. She is now on a rampage. As a marine biologist tries desperately to subdue the Creature the body count continues to rise. Prepare yourself for the ultimate showdown between man and beast. Every second counts as the strangers make one final attempt to escape. An attempt where the price of failure is death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118302</url></doc>
