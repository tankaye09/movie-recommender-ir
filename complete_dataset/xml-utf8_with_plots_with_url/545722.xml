<plot>The Boyz Are Back in Town explores the politics, the dramas, the passions and the lifestyles of five lads thrown into a world of celebrity adoration. But now older, wiser, entertainment-business-sharper, these boys have become men and pulling no punches, each have a compelling, revealing, story to tell. As Boyzone prepare for their first tour in over seven years, sold out across 25 UK arena dates, you learn how this boy band became so huge, with record sales in excess of 15 million, yet so suddenly and so dramatically split and what life has been like for each of them in the intervening years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545722</url></doc>
