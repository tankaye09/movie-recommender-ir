<plot>On a chilly foggy night two men alight from a train at an isolated railway station, and stay for a night at the Dak Bangla. One of these men is Ajay Sachdev, and the other is Prem Kumar Chopra. Shortly after their arrival, a series of brutal murders shake up the region. The mysteries behind these murders are compounded by the appearance of a white Saree-clad female apparition, which appears and disappears at will. And ghostly cries are heard from a nearby graveyard. The police are involved and their investigation results in the arrest of a suspect, Ajay, who had a motive, and was present during all the deaths, but they have no answers as to the apparition and the cries from the graveyard. Ajay is arrested, but subsequently escapes, leaving this small community fearing for their lives - both from Ajay - and the unknown horror that awaits each of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476957</url></doc>
