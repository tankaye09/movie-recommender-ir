<plot>Johnny is the type of cordial, well-liked neighbor you are guaranteed to find in any typical neighborhood. He mainly keeps to himself, but is always pleasant to talk to and have around. He has been following the story of a serial killer who has recently plagued his community, and with news of a fifth victim, he wonders if the murderous rampage will ever end. As clues begin to reveal themselves, Johnny discovers secrets about the gruesome killer that he would have never imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278699</url></doc>
