At home she explains to her husband her plan to seduce and bigamously marry Sir Fabian Ormerod in order to extort money from him. After cleverly engineering a meeting with Sir Fabian at the opera everything seems to be proceeding according to plan until Angela falls pregnant. Knowing of Sir Fabian's desire for an heir Angela convinces Sir Fabian that the child is his and the couple marry. The marriage causes friction with Honesty, the unbalanced daughter from Sir Fabian's first marriage. Events really comes to a head when Harry is born and Honesty realises he will be the heir to the family fortune. The stakes are raised even higher when Angela starts to receive anonymous letters threatening to expose her lurid past. Finally, all hell breaks loose when Harry is kidnapped and the police become involved. Who is the mysterious letter writer? How are these events connected to the mysterious, unsolved death of Sir Fabian's first wife? Will all be revealed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542675</url></doc>
