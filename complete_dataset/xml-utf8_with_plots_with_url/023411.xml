<plot>A janitor, Michel, a florist, Grigoris and a taxi-driver, Aristotelis, all lose their jobs on the same day. All three of these unlucky characters repair to a bench where they meet and become friends. Later on, while walking, they find a letter in the street by which they are informed that a very rich Greek-American, John Chatzikoumar, is going to come to Greece in order to meet his nephew Mike, whom he hasn't seen since he was a boy. Broke as they are, they come up with the great idea of presenting Grigoris as Mike. After various grotesque incidents, order is eventually restored, and, as is usually the case in such films, everything turns out fine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023411</url></doc>
