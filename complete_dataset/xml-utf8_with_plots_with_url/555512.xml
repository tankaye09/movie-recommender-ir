<plot>This virtual walk begins in the village of Eynsford, a "picture postcard" village in rural Kent. After crossing the 500 year old humpback bridge over the Darent River, the camera passes several half-timbered cottages before setting out along Sparepenny Lane. From there, it's a beautiful walk through the English countryside past several farms and manor houses. Following a narrow footpath, canopied by lush green trees, the camera transports the viewer beside the River Darent as it flows southward toward yet another picturesque village. Crossing an ancient bridge, the 30 minute virtual walk ends in Shoreham, a "cracking little village" known for its many ale houses. Filmed with camera stabilization equipment, the viewer of this virtual walk will feel as if he is actually in the English countryside.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555512</url></doc>
