<plot>Against the oppressive environment of religious fanaticism, political turmoil, archaic traditions, and the rise of fundamentalist Islamic movements, one extraordinary Arabian woman rises up in a personal, revealing, and dangerous quest to champion justice and equality for all women. WOMAN is a feature-length documentary based on the writings, lectures, and life of Nobel Prize nominee, activist Bouthaina Shaaban as she fearlessly ignites awareness while advancing the cause of rights for Arab women - from securing formal acknowledgments throughout the Arab world that women should be afforded basic human rights, to waging an international battle defending the integrity of the real Arab female, all accomplished with the firm hand of diplomacy and the power of her pen. The film journeys back to Bouthaina's beginning as a schoolgirl in a small obscure Syrian village to her evolution into a top international politician representing her country, while continuing her fight for female equality. WOMAN reveals Dr. Shaaban as an outspoken human rights activist and female leader living in a male dominated culture. Maintaining equilibrium between embracing the traditional values of Middle Eastern society and fighting for her deeply held belief that all people are created equal, she speaks out about the misconceptions of the female role in Islam. Ultimately, we come to know her as an inspiring leader who is dedicated to uniting the spirit of humanity into one family on earth. It is Bouthaina's humility and tolerance that elevates people's hopes, fed by the fire of her passion and her quest for a better tomorrow - for everyone. Her enlightened path empowers the souls of those without a voice, invoking the strengths of the courageous, and shedding light onto those whose hearts remain in darkness. Bouthaina Shabaan is WOMAN.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659823</url></doc>
