<plot>A young man remains in his comfortable yet stifling world because of his fears of the unknown. When a mirror mysteriously surfaces, he gazes into to and sees another world - he seems to enter it and experience his true inner desires - freedom, nature, companionship, life. But in reality, this is just a vision and he finds himself still in his cold, desolate room, standing in front of his reflection. The only way for him to live life to it's fullest is to face his fears and leave his world, regardless of the outcome.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457085</url></doc>
