<plot>'Smokey J. and the Keys' is the story loss, love and adventure. 'Smokey J.' himself is a metaphor for a mind clouded by ones own self, and the searching for something that you know is there but cannot seem to find. In spite of himself, the fates are kind to Smokey J. and eventually he ends up where he was lost the day before, learning nothing except that its OK to be himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502695</url></doc>
