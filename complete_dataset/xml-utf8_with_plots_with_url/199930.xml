<plot>Blake Mycoskie, is known to America as the guy that lost season two of "The Amazing Race" and a million dollar prize by just two minutes. After that blow, he traveled to Argentina to learn to play polo. He learned much more than how to hit a ball while on horseback. Blake observed a level of severe poverty that changed his life forever. He saw children whose parents could not afford shoes to protect their feet. Every day kids suffer, having to walk miles to attend school and to get fresh water. Wanting to do something to help, Blake was moved to action. He applied his entrepreneurial knowledge and started a business that would give a pair of shoes to children for every pair sold, One for One. He called it TOMS, shoes for tomorrow. The award winning film, For Tomorrow, picks up not even a year after that trip, when Blake returned to Argentina with his family, volunteers and his first few employees on an emotional journey to personal place 10,000 pairs of shoes on the feet of children in need. The documentary is an inspirational adventure that shows how compassion can create major change. Today, TOMS Shoes is one of the fast growing brands in the USA and is being sold throughout South America, Asia and Europe. Blake's goal is to make sure that every child in the world has shoes. Changing a life begins with a single step.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199930</url></doc>
