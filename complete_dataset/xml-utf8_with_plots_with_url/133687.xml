<plot>Charlie Gordon is a success. A young Asian-American attorney, he has the Ivy League pedigree and six-figure job at the most prestigious law firm in the city. Even so, he passes his long days and nights of constant work with the vague sense that something is missing. When his law firm falls on hard times and decides to 'right-size' it's headcount, Charlie suddenly finds himself without a job or a sense of self. Rudderless, he begins to drift into self-imposed isolation until, as a last, desperate measure, Charlie reaches out to his ex-girlfriend, Heidi, for comfort. As they start to spend more and more time together again, Heidi stirs up his old feelings for her, along with a long-forgotten desire to do something more with his life. Told through a series of creative flash-backs, flash-forwards and long-takes, "Dear Heidi" explores the identity of one young, American professional and the set of real compromises and anxieties that come with success in our modern world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133687</url></doc>
