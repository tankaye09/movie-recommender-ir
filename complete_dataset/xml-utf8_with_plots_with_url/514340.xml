<plot>Starving Actress Megumi will do "WhatEVER it takes" to get her break in Hollywood. Whatever it takes including: chauffeuring her BFF Donnie around town in exchange for industry contacts. Growing up in "The Hood," Donnie lives by the motto, "God gave me two gifts. The gift of gab, and the gift of extortion." Although Donnie "extorts" all these rides from "Gumi," they are actually good friends who are both living by "The Secret" and envisioning the best for each other. When Megumi doesn't have a commercial running, she gets by on unemployment checks and dating wealthy men she meets on Sugardaddie.com. She also surrounds herself with friends who feed her like ex-boss/friend Twice Divorced Divina. Megumi attempts to overcome every hurdle including exchanging a blow job for an edit job when she needs a project edited fast and free. When "The Secret" isn't working as fast as she expects it too, Megumi seeks the guidance of psychics.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514340</url></doc>
