<plot>This picture created more enthusiasm than any other miscellaneous subject made during the past six months. It is entirely out of the ordinary, hence its popularity. Several men wade into the shallow water, and with large spears, catch the lively salmon as they swim down with the tide, and, thrusting the spears into the fish, they are flung toward the shore, where they are gathered together and shipped to the market. This is a refreshing picture to exhibit, showing a large body of water rushing by as though it was driven by some great force. The scenery is beautiful.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479975</url></doc>
