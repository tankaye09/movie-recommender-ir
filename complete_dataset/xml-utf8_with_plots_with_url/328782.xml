<plot>The dramatic story of the campaigns of 58 to 53 B.C. in which Julius Caesar and his Roman Legions conquered Gaul modern day France. Caesar's intervention in the brutal Gallic inter-tribal warfare was originally prompted by genuine concern for Italian security, but as the campaign developed, Rome's greatest commander began to hatch plans for full conquest. Remarkably, Julius Caesar's own account of the Gallic Wars have survived to this very day. Superb depictions of life in Gaul in the first century B.C.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328782</url></doc>
