<plot>During these past years David Blaine gained enormous publicity through his spectacular stunts. In 1999 he was buried alive in a coffin of glass for seven days. In the year 2000 he was frozen in a block of ice for almost 62 hours. In 2002 he stood for 35 hours on a 105 feet tall pillar. For his action 'Above The Below' in fall 2003 David Blaine starved himself for 44 days, hanging on a Plexiglas box on a crane near Tower Bridge in London. The documentary about David Blaine's last action 'Above The Below' deals with the questions: What is so fascinating about David Blaine? What are his motives? Does he give an answer to the longing of people for meaning and spirituality? Is David Blaine a modern figure of salvation like Jesus? People who fast are fascinating and draw the attention of other people, since the very beginning of our history. Does David Blaine stand in that tradition? Why did 'Above The Below' become such a big event for the masses and the media.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011720</url></doc>
