<plot>New Orleans has never looked worse. And never sounded better. In the efforts to 're-New Orleans' after Hurricane Katrina the musicians of New Orleans have become a voice for the people. While political processes remain mis-tuned, their music is instrumental in keeping New Orleans swinging. This inspiring music doc reveals the political reinvention and cultural evolution of the city, featuring passionate performances and candid interviews with a "WHO'S WHO" of New Orleans music. How powerful is a musical note? With the coming of Mardi Gras comes the chance to speak out... and no-one can silence the politics of jazz.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583266</url></doc>
