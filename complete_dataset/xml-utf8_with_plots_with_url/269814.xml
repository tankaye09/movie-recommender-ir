<plot>Dorothy Sanders will be dead soon. That's the good news. The bad news is there's a hurricane approaching and the family is in way over their heads. The mother is abusive. The sister can't stop laughing. The grandmother can't see or hear but she sure can scream loud. The son is trying it all together while his wife will do "anything" to be a part of this incredibly dysfunctional family. But as the Sanders family will soon discover, it can always get worse!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269814</url></doc>
