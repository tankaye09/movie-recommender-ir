<plot>After the "accidental" death of his father, Narayan Srivastav (Satyen Kappu), young Krishna is driven out of the house by his paternal uncle Sajhan (Paresh Rawal), and goes to live with his school-teacher Saraswati Devi (Raakhee), who has two children, Suraj &amp; Jyoti, of her own. Sajhan's tactics separates Suraj from his family, and giving him up for dead, Saraswati looks after Krishna and Jyoti. Years later, Krishna (Anil Kapoor) has grown up, and so has the only son of Sajhan, Raghu (Tej Sapru), a criminal lord, rapist and local goonda, protected by his dad by bribing the local police. Jyoti gets raped and killed by Raghu and two of his pals, and they also run over Saraswati rendering her crippled. Both Krishna and Saraswati swear to avenge Jyoti's death. Then Suraj (Mohsin Khan) re-enters their lives, as a police inspector, and is bent on arresting Krishna by hook or by crook, casting doubts whether he is or not on the pay-roll of Sajhan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?441795</url></doc>
