<plot>A 90-minute documentary by film critic, author and historian Richard Schickel that is highlighted by a rare and candid interview with the writer, director and actor Woody Allen. The interview, shot exclusively for this documentary in New York in October 2001, marks the first time Allen has participated in an American documentary about his career. The program examines Allen's work on such landmark films as "Take the Money and Run" (1969), "Bananas" (1971), "Sleeper" (1973), "Love and Death" (1975), "Annie Hall" (1977), "Manhattan" (1979), "Hannah and Her Sisters" (1986) and "Crimes and Misdemeanors" (1989). The interview and film clips, including scenes from his most recent film at the time the interview was filmed, "Hollywood Ending," are used to highlight his prolific career and examine Allen's childhood and explore what drew him to writing and directing. One of the foremost American filmmakers of the 20th century, Allen shares anecdotes about his extensive body of work from the past thirty-something years to help audiences understand why these films continue to entertain the public as well as his technique of using both humor and drama to tackle personal issues and explore universal themes such as life, death, religion and sex. Unfortunately, ex-soul-mate Mia Farrow would not allow any film clips of her to be used on the program. Hell hath no fury...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660553</url></doc>
