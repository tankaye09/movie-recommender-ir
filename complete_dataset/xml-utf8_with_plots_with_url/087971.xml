<plot>Hans Pumpernickel and Hiney Dingelspiel are seen operating a sausage machine. "Dey are making some gonversations mit demselves" when a man enters with two board yard dogs which they buy and proceed to grind them up into "sissage." Customers arrive, one by one, and purchase the "wurst." Hiney waits on them whilst Hans operates the machine. Picture No. 1 is 75 feet. No. 2 ends by throwing a Chinaman in the machine and is withdrawn in the regular "Frankfurter" shape. His head appears in the end and Dingelspiel twirls it around by the queue. Both films are beautiful in point of photography and exceedingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087971</url></doc>
