<plot>The smashed corner of a trunk containing counterfeiting paraphernalia reveals to Helen that there is treachery afoot at Lone Point. Detectives capture two of the trio, but one of them gets away, pursued by Helen, across a high railroad trestle. Helen is captured, bound and gagged, and suspended from the trestle, across which the local is scheduled to pass at any moment. Helen manages to get her hands free just as the passing train severs the rope, and causes her to fly through the air and reach a trestle beam just in the nick of time. From there she is raised back to track level by the two detectives, who have also now captured the third culprit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?552439</url></doc>
