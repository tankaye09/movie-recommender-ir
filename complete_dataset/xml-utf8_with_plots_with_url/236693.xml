<plot>Because of his hot, often-flaring temper, Jimmy Kelly Eddie Quillan) loses another job, much to the disappointment of his mother (Mary Gordon) and the disgust of his fiancee, Margie (Joan Woodbury). Margie is a secretary for lawyer L. Herbert Oakley (Ian Keith), who advises Jimmy to study law, but that doesn't last long. His friend, Sammy Cohen (Sidney Miller) gets him a job with him as a process server. He serves a summons on a night club dancer, Carmencita (Armida), who says she owes a bill because she had a fight with her sweetheart - one L. Herbert Oakley. The district attorney (Emmett Vogan) delegates Jimmy and Sammy to serve subpoenas on a "Trixie Belle" (Maxie Rosembloom), who turns out to be a formidable gangster, plus one on a mysterious "Mr.7". Trixie holds Jimmy a prisoner in an apartment, but gets drunk and reveals that Oakley is Mr. 7, the leader of an oil-swindle operation. Sammy helps Jimmy escape and they learn that Oakley is about to leave for Montreal, and is taking Margiue with him. Jimmy rescues Margie and serves the summons on Oakley. Just before he and Margie are to be married the next day, Jimmy receives a notice from the draft board demanding his appearance that afternoon. As he departs, his mother assures Margie that, since Jimmy never held a job more than two months, the war will soon be over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236693</url></doc>
