<plot>What if the pied piper of Hamlyn were a woman, and the town's refusal to pay was largely based on the men's bad behavior and their wives' jealousy? Tired of milquetoast men, the women in the town of Hope send for someone to rid them of rats. Pippa appears in her white van and white suit to fumigate, poison, and trap the pests. She also uses her flute to call the last of them to perdition. But then, the town won't pay up: the men call Pippa a bitch and the women call her a whore. Stung by the injustice of this, Pippa waits until nightfall: while the men are down the pub, she again reaches for her flute.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585444</url></doc>
