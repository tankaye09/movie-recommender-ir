During a desperate burglary to get money for a hit of methamphetamine, Gary is confronted by a middle-aged woman, cornered and scared he overpowers the woman and rapes her. Horrified by this senseless assault, he flees to his home, where he still lives with his recently retired father Ron. After locking himself away in his bedroom, the next morning Gary has a epiphany. He decides he is going to turn his life around and do good in the world. Apart from a drug and alcohol problem, Gary has low self esteem and a unhealthy understanding of the world shaped by his tyrannical father and a rampant and corrupting consumer culture. His struggle to go clean, get a job, stay away from his peer group and help his father and sister won't be easy. Especially while the woman he raped, lives just a few doors down the street. Deciding to change a life is one thing, changing it is another.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016326</url></doc>
