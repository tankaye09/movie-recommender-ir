<plot>History of "The March of Time" newsreel series, which, before television, covered the news for motion picture audiences 1935 to 1951. Interviews with creative team of producer, director, editors. Many excerpts from the newsreel series. With: Louis De Rochemont, producer. Maury Wiseman, film editor. Jack Glen, director. Lothar Wolff, editor. (All creative personnel on "The March of Time.") Interview subjects cover reporting styles, logistical difficulties with 35 mm. cameras and big lights, the use of reenactments, the difference between the "truth of yesterday and the truth of today and how truth in film is perishable." Reflections on technical details for a "natural look", no zooms or panning, flat lighting, wide angle lens and distortion; and "The March of Time's" influence on today's television journalism. With many excerpts from "The March of Times".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201512</url></doc>
