<plot>A processional spectacle, zoological display. Here we see all those who take part in the Circus exhibitions in parade, entering the Hippodrome. No one has the slightest idea of the number of men engaged in this gigantic enterprise. It comprises a whole army, consisting of Chiefs, Champions in their respective callings, Bareback Riders, Clowns, Animal Trainers, Snake Charmers, the Ringmaster, and followed by all the animals of the entire show. In other words, it is the entire Circus on Parade under their tents. Marvelous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221506</url></doc>
