<plot>A man comes to on the floor of an empty apartment - no furniture, no decor on the walls, no gas in the stove. He has only his cell phone, a jacket, and a hangover. Somewhere else in the city, his wife is in a kitchen, harried by three rambunctious children, angry at her husband. She leaves a message on his cell phone that the marriage is over. He calls his friend Jimmy and tells him to get over here and to bring some beer. Then, a young woman he doesn't know walks into the apartment. What's going on?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018227</url></doc>
