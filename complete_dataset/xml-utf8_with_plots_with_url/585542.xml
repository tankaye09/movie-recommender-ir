<plot>In a new hybrid of witness testimony, archive and archaeology, we reveal the full, untold story of the Defence of Britain. In this series surviving Home Guard veterans recall what life was like in the Real "Dad's Army" and archaeologist Francis Pryor explores the undiscovered archaeology of World War Two Britain. Sixty years ago Britain braced itself for invasion. So how would this country have withstood the might of Nazi Germany? The TV series "Dad's Army" has weaved an enduring myth, but were the Home Guard really as bumbling as the men portrayed in Walmington on Sea? Now surviving Home Guard veterans explain what life was like in the Real "Dad's Army," and demonstrate how they trained to tackle the Nazi's. This is the story of the Defence of Britain, and the Real Dad's Army.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585542</url></doc>
