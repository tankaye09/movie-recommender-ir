<plot>Hooligan crawls through a window into a room where two ladies have set a dainty table for an afternoon luncheon. Hooligan proceeds to make himself at home and sits down at the table. As he is devouring the dainties, the ladies return. One of them, perceiving how Hooligan had effected his entrance, closes the window, while the other calls the police. Hooligan dodges about and finally jumps head first through the window, smashing the glass as he does so. The scene then changes to the exterior of the house, where Hooligan is discovered as he comes through the window, landing in the arms of the fat policeman, who promptly arrests him. An excellent comedy scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229662</url></doc>
