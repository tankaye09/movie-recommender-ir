<plot>Spider is a short wildlife film with an entertaining and artistic style concentrated on a world through the eyes of the spider. Viewing their big world in such a small space... your garden. Throughout the film, you will find out how Orb Weaver spiders acrobatically create their webs, how they catch their prey and other spiders will even steel from their neighbors. This film is designed to be watched in an entertaining but factual layout. The audience will start to imagine that they have entered into something so different we thought we knew more about.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510228</url></doc>
