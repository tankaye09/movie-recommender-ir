<plot>The issue of sweatshop labor to produce collegiate clothing has long been an ongoing battle for student activists the world over. In the spring of 2008, college students were holding sit-ins and protests across America demanding their schools sign onto the Designated Suppliers Program (DSP), which would ensure that workers making their collegiate clothing were given basic human rights. Students at the University of Montana had been facing an up-hill battle with their school's administrators for years and finally decided to escalate their campaign for workers' rights. Many rallied behind the leaders of the Students for Economic and Social Justice (SESJ) who were occupying their president's office, demanding their administration also sign onto the DSP. What resulted from the student activism was something that had not been seen since the Vietnam War.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649096</url></doc>
