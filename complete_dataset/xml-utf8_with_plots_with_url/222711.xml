<plot>Ellen, a young woman in Los Angeles who likes to take walks in her neighborhood, tells us in a voice-over that she likes men but hasn't met a good one in a long time. She's tried the Internet and personals, and finally she goes to a dating service. The interviewer there asks if she's had any bad dates lately, and she describes several; we see them in flashbacks. The dating-service manager refers her to "Mr. Chiba," whom she meets at a caf√©. He offers her green tea with some extra ingredient. He's odd and off-putting. Is this another dead end?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222711</url></doc>
