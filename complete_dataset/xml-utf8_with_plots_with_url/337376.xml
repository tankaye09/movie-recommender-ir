<plot>With 30 years' experience hosting shows, Armand Monroe introduces us to the world of female impersonators in Montreal. They are performers, distinct from transvestites, hookers and Halloween revelers. Armand and others tell stories about their relationships with parents, with spouses, and with lovers, and about discovering their love for female impersonation. An aging, plump performer is interviewed; one person discusses her sex change operation. Natch Taylor, artistic director for Les Ballet Trockadero, talks about parents' experiences coming for the first time to see their sons dance. All is placid except when a film actor discusses appearing in a gay-bashing scene, which we see.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337376</url></doc>
