<plot>Aspiring writer Roth Monroe gets a lot more than he bargained for when he moves into his new apartment. From his window he witnesses his landlord, Hackworth Bianca, beat a man senseless, and subsequently dispose the man's remains in a series of garbage bags. What follows is a bloody series of events that Monroe photographs in hopes of exposing his bizarre landlord's murderous secrets. Monroe reluctantly involves his beautiful neighbor Miranda Page when he informs her of the landlord's recent activities, but his secret surveillance soon leads Monroe and his best friend Miles Wilson  into high stakes danger. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but in Monroe's case his snapshots lead to a shocking turn of events that changes his life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503118</url></doc>
