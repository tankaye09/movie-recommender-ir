<plot>The proverbial bad boy annoys two Chinese, who are hard at work at their wash tubs. They finally catch him and give him a good drubbing, whereupon he grasps them both, one in each hand, and throws them over his head. He kicks them and rolls about the floor twisting them in all positions until they are lifeless. Throwing them on the floor he departs, when the Chinese suddenly come to life and wind up the picture with one of their peculiar dances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206727</url></doc>
