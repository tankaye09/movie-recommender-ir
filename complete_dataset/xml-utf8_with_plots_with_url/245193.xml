<plot>At the opening of the picture Hooligan is seen wandering about in a heavy snow storm. He falls asleep in the snow and dreams. In his dreams he becomes a personage of great wealth and position, with valets and servants to wait upon him. He is reclining luxuriously in a feather bed, and Santa Claus comes down the chimney with pack laden with bottles of champagne, boxes of cigars, etc. Hooligan is soon dressed in the height of fashion and sits to a magnificent dinner. After he has enjoyed this to the utmost he dreams that he is going to the opera and allows his valet to dress him in his evening clothes. When he attempts to move, however, he finds that his valet has nailed his shoes to the floor. Highly indignant, he starts to chase the valet, but suddenly awakes only to find a big policeman standing over him and rapping his feet with his night stick. A splendid scene throughout. The Santa Claus scene is omitted when desired, as that portion is appropriate only to the holiday season.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245193</url></doc>
