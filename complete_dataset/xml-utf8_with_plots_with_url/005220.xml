<plot>Yod is a guy from Northeastern Thailand who works as a taxi driver to support his family. His wife used to be a famous singer in a café. Almost everybody in Yod's life have a combination to the number 24-36-24 (an address, mobile number, measurements, etc.) One day, Yod is forced to accept a lottery ticket in lieu of taxi fare, which ends up being a super winning ticket! Immediately, everybody around him begins to change as they try to convince Yod to cash in the money. Eventually things get more and more violent, and Yod realizes none of them really care about him....It's all about the money....He runs away to Northern Thailand to think of what to do....</plot><plot>Yod is a guy from Northeastern Thailand who works as a taxi driver to support his family.
