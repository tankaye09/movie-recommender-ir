<plot>Bob Dobalina is an award-winning copywriter who really wants to be a screenwriter. After letting his screenwriting software sit on his shelf for three years, he finally has the big idea that inspires him to load Screenwriter 4.0 and get writing. The one obstacle he isn't expecting is the Screenwriter's Assistant, Screenwriter 4.0's animated helper who's annoyed Bob left her to sit around so long. The two engage in a spirited and acerbic dialogue - meanwhile accomplishing nothing. By the time their power struggle is finally resolved, both Bob and the Assistant learn that neither one of them is really in charge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?671000</url></doc>
