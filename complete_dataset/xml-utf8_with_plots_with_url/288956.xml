<plot>When Henry Ruiz, a young boy in the Bronx, is caught trespassing at Yankee Stadium, he's given the chance to work off his infraction as a helper to Pete Sheehy, the clubhouse manager. What he doesn't know is that Pete died in 1985. He's a ghost. Though the current Yankees have already moved from the old stadium to the new one, the ghosts of Yankees past are staying behind, following the lead of their captain, Lou Gehrig, the Iron Horse. But Henry can see the ghosts. And he can understand Gehrig sadly too well, given his own mother's own battle with illness. It turns out that he might be the only hope for convincing the Yankee ghosts to make the move - before the wrecking balls knock down their home forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?288956</url></doc>
