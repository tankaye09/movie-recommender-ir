<plot>Everyone deserves a second chance at life, but what about a third, fourth, fifth, and beyond? "Death, After Life" follows Robert Havoc through a fast-paced, gun-blastin', pseudo-mystical ride into the world of men that have stumbled upon the power to repeatedly rise from death, seemingly at will. Having been unwittingly injected with this everlasting life, he confronts his own immortality demons while hunting those who would use this gift for the good and those who would use it for the very, very bad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133811</url></doc>
