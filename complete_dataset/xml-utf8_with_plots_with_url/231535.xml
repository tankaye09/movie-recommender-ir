<plot>Writer Misuzu Nakahara confesses her involvement in the 300 Million Yen Affair. In the chaotic days of the 1960s, Misuzu, a lonely high school girl from a troubled family, finds a sanctuary with her nihilistic brother Ryo and his friends, who pass day by day hanging around a shadowy café bar and indulging themselves in sex, drugs and alcohol. As the social unrest seeps in and their relationships gradually fall off, Misuzu gets drawn into a dangerous plot against the society set by one of the rebellious boys, Kishi - robbing a bank car of 300 million yen. The two accomplices set out for numerous rehearsals, and their hearts get closer secretly and quietly. On one rainy day, helped by coincidences, the heist goes successful to give a huge impact on Japan, but it only brings Misuzu a great sense of loss and sadness she had never expected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231535</url></doc>
