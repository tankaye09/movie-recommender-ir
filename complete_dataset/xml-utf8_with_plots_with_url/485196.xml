<plot>Depression Served Six Ways (Seks Lag af Depression) is a dark comedy about six people living in a suburban apartment complex who drive each other insane. One could call it "panic in the projects!" Sofie is a lonely thirty-two year old woman whose only real pleasure is in harassing her neighbors. That said, on her birthday, all she wants is peace of mind. Instead, there's the noisy kid literally bouncing off the walls in the flat overhead; a disheveled 'artist' who torments her as he hammers away on his casio organ down below; an unemployed whimpering man who stews in his lukewarm beer while anchored to the park bench outside her window; and a boyfriend who forgets the significance of this special day. Hell is going to break loose, and a nosy teenage neighborhood know-it-all will see the whole thing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485196</url></doc>
