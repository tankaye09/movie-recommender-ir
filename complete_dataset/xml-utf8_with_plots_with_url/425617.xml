<plot>Charlie, all set for a day's golf game, is horrified to discover it is pouring rain outside. Bessie suggests that since he can't play golf, he can help wallpaper the house instead. Charlie reluctantly agrees but is generally inept at everything he attempts, breaking a chair, having trouble getting his ladder to stay up, getting hit in the face with a board, getting stuck behind a wallpaper strip, and dealing with his knuckle-brained assistant, Junior. Much to Charlie's surprise, it is sunny outside an open window but still raining outside. The "rain" is really a hose pouring over the doorway, a ruse Bessie used to get him to stay home. Charlie plays golf anyway and is beset by a terrible thunderstorm!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425617</url></doc>
