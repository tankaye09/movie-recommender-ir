<plot>A rural gentleman visits one of the city parks to attend a picnic. Not knowing where to look for the entrance, he stands bewildered in the middle of the car tracks. Finally he gets his bearings and starts to walk down the track. An electric car crowded with people suddenly rounds a curve at the head of the street, and bears down on Reuben full speed. The motorman applies the brakes, while he and the passengers on the front platform yell at the hayseed to get out of the way. Rube pays no attention to the shouts. Suddenly he gets a terrible jolt that knocks him off his feet into the fender, and before the car is stopped Reuben is carried to the gate. A very exciting scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469832</url></doc>
