<plot>This documentary short examines teenage youth, of which an alarming two percent is delinquent. Suggested problems are overcrowded and under staffed schools, and households with both parents working. After showing a dramatization of what happens when a delinquent youth steals a car and runs over the town's favorite police officer, the court system is also shown to be a problem. The courts, according to this movie, are wrong to try such youths as adults, because it is obviously the failings of schools and parents which cause kids to go bad. The movie then suggest town meetings and team organizations for the kids, because as the movie says, "Any kid would rather be in a team than a gang!"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?533785</url></doc>
