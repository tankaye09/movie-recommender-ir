<plot>At an estimated 10 million people, Roma are the largest, yet most discriminated-against minority in Europe. In Bulgaria, 70 percent of young Roma, (approximately 30,000 children), attend sub-standard schools in segregated Romani neighborhoods. In 2000, Romani activists from the Bulgarian town of Vidin spearheaded the first initiative for educational desegregation in Europe. Six years later, more than 3,000 Romani children are bused daily to integrated schools in eight Bulgarian towns. Students in the desegregation programs now go to school regularly, get higher grades, and have better prospects for continuing on to higher education.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?179982</url></doc>
