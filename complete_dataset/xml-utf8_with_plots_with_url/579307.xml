<plot>San Diego High School Senior and resident geek WINSTON CONNELLY JR. has his typically boring life turned upside down when the normally reserved, President of the Chess Club awakens in an alley just outside of TIJUANA, MEXICO dressed in a seventies style, powder blue tuxedo with absolutely no idea how he got there. Slowly but surely (with the help of a few random events) Winston regains his memories from THE NIGHT BEFORE, memories he wishes he could forget. The good news is that earlier in the night Winston picks up TARA "TJ" MITCHELL the hottest, most unattainable girl in school to take her to the prom in his father's prized convertible mustang (she lost a bet with her best friend) while his best friend EARVIN "Q" QUAYLE tags along in the back seat (his date is meeting him at the prom). The bad news is Winston gets lost on his way to prom and inadvertently crosses the border into Mexico. He subsequently loses his wallet, his keys, his car and his best friend. To top it all off an overly inebriated Winston accidentally sells Tara (who incidentally is the San Diego Police Chief's daughter) to a pimp named Tito for Twenty-five hundred dollars and a powder blue tuxedo. With time ticking away, Winston has to find and then save his best friend and the girl of his dreams from the mysterious Tito and his band of merry misfits while simultaneously trying to get Tara home before her gun totting, Police Chief father realizes she's missing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579307</url></doc>
