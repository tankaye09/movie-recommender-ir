<plot>The journey continues as missionaries Tim Scott and Will Decker return home to America. We now find them struggling to adjust to life in Los Angeles where everything seems so foreign. After surviving a near fatal car accident, these two daring missionaries say a painful goodbye to those they love and once again journey into the unknown. Armed only with a backpack, a change of clothes and their Bibles, Tim and Will depart for the most dangerous and remote lands on the planet. From the prehistoric jungles of Borneo to the snow covered mountains of Tibet and through the war zones of Afghanistan, the guys encounter Taliban gunfights, Siberian blizzards, bandits and sacrificial burials as they risk their lives to preach the gospel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?616670</url></doc>
