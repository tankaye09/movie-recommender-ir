<plot>Not really smooth with the ladies, Brian is dragged out by his buddy, Joe, for another night on the town. Like usual Joe ditches Brian to go find his evening's entertainment. But this time it is actually in Brian's favor. He meets the girl of his dreams and actually gets her number. Of course this high is only temporary for Brian to find out the next day when he looks at the number that the old envelope that she wrote it on sticks to itself and rips off the last digit. Brian now completely frustrated decides to step up for the first time in his life and put himself out on a limb and call all 10 possible numbers to try to find his dream girl. Of course with the different characters that Brian meets, his journey has only begun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006339</url></doc>
