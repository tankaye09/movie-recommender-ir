<plot>It is a surreal fantasy about an eighty-seven-year-old woman (Rosanna Seaborn) whose dream it is to portray the "whole life" of a woman from youth to old age. The story of a woman who never married or experienced love in real life and who at the end of her life, chooses as her vehicle a play set in the nineteenth century to live out this fantasy. She discovers in one hour what it would have been like to have been married for fifty years with all the ups and downs, experiencing motherhood, love, and dealing with infidelity, etc... A fictitious love story between two eighty year olds. Creating a world in which reality and fiction become one in the field of imagination and sometimes spilling far beyond, into the twilight zone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037040</url></doc>
