<plot>A documentary about Pinks Hot Dogs, a landmark Hollywood eating spot that's open 24 hours a day and is famous for its hot dogs and the many Hollywood actors who often patronize it ('Orson Welles' (qv) ate there several times a week when he was in town and would polish off 10 to 15 dogs at a time).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433395</url></doc>
