<plot>Documentary about a traditional parade that goes marching the streets of Ipanema, in Rio de Janeiro, during the Carnival, called Banda de Ipanema (Band from Ipanema), and the man who created it in 1966, Albino Pinheiro. Albino was sort of a cultural promoter, father of the series of Brazilian pop music shows at affordable prices, called "6 e Meia" (Six and a half). Also, the film shows many important people in the Band's history, such as actress Leila Diniz, maestro Tom Jobim, musician Pixinguinha and the cultural surroundings of that time, such as Teatro Opinião (a group of politically engaged theater people), the Bossa Nova and Cinema Novo movements (in music and cinema, respectively), and the festive left-wing people who struggled against the military dictatorship of the time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058219</url></doc>
