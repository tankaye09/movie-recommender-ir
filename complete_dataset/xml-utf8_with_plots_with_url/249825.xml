<plot>Dharampal presides over his palatial home and his family with dictatorial ruthlessness. His wife is terrified of him. His sister would rather die than marry without his permission. Naturally, when his daughter, Rekha falls in love with a mere labourer, Bhola, this angers Dharampal to such an extent that he implicates Bhola for raping and abducting her, and forces her to testify against Bhola in court, and she does so. When Shankar and his wife attempt to help Bhola and Rekha, Dharampal has his men chop off both of Shankar's arms. The only one who could stand up to Dharampal is Kishanlal, his sister's former lover, but how long will Dharampal tolerate him? "Hum bhi tere bandhey hain hum bhi insaan hai, tumhey hum pe taras kyon ahta nahin..." is hummable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249825</url></doc>
