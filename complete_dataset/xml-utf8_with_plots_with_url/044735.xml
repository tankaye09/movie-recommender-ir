<plot>For 71 years, Archbold Stadium had served as the home for Syracuse University Football. When it was built in 1907 it was the largest concrete stadium in America, and the largest gift ever to a university in the United States. Throughout their history, the Orangemen had always won at least one game at home in Archbold Stadium. In its final season in 1978, the Orangemen were in danger of breaking that tradition. The team entered into its final home game against the 9th ranked U.S. Naval Academy having not won a single game at home all season. The documentary retells the story of the 1978 season, and the final home game against Navy. Through a combination of interviews with the players themselves, and actual game footage, the game is brought back to life. The documentary features interviews with several legends of both the NFL and of college football who played and coached for Syracuse during that final season.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044735</url></doc>
