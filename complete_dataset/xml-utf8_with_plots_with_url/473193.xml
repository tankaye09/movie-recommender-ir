<plot>"Sacred Waters of Cambodia" uncovers Angkor's ancient building and water systems and explores how Canadian architects, engineers, aid workers and the Cambodian people are looking at Cambodia's ancient civilizations for practical knowledge, inspiration and hope. "Sacred Waters of Cambodia" is a film about the genius and tragedy of the Cambodian people, about their resilient spirit, and their hope for the future. It is also an explanation of the importance of culture to both the morale, and the practical functioning of any civilization. "Sacred Waters" illustrates how people from around the world are working together to reassemble the infrastructure of a country destroyed by war, and how together they are learning from the cultural, religious, and technological successes of the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473193</url></doc>
