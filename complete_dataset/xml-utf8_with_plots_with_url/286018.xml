<plot>Sharda lives a wealthy lifestyle along with her widower dad, Thakur Ranvir Singh, in Bombay, India. She incurs her dad's displeasure when she gets elopes and gets married to Jaichand Prakash, who is poor. She gets pregnant and Jaichand passes away, leaving her to give birth to Kanhaiyaa. When he gets to be 9 years of age, an ailing Sharda too passes away, compelling Kanhaiyaa to live in the Bal Kalyan Anarthalay, run by a cruel Manager, Makhanlal, and his equally cruel wife, Radha. When Kanhaiyaa is abused, beaten, and starved, he escapes, ends up in Bombay, straight into the clutches of Madhav Singh and Rahim, who house several male orphans and train them to be petty thieves. Kanhaiyaa does not want to steal but is compelled to join the gang. One day he gets beaten-up, but ends up being looked after by none other then his estranged grandfather, who comes to know of his identity, and is thrilled to have him back. But Kanhaiyaa's problems are far from over for he is abducted by Madhav's gang, and taken back to their hideout. When Madhav finds out that there is a reward of ten thousand Rupees being offered by Ranvir, he decides to return Kanhaiyaa. A much relieved Kanhaiyaa looks forward to being re-united with his grandfather little knowing that Ranvir's nephew, Pratap, has other plans for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?286018</url></doc>
