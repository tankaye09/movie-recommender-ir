<plot>Riley Joseph is taking a trip. Traveling makes her jumpy and the phone calls from her over-tending friend Brenna aren't helping. Riley winds through the back roads of a California coastal oblivion. At the most remote portion of her journey her car fails her. She waits half the day for help, but when the massive truck pulls in behind her she begins to feel something is very wrong. Is it in her mind? Is it Brenna's suggestions playing upon her vulnerability? Or is the stranger now approaching her hunting these lonely roads for prey?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?141511</url></doc>
