<plot>Through Henna's eyes, an 8 year old Emiratie girl living in a fishing village, we witness the traditions that have held this community together and glimpse into the future as to what awaits her. Set in the UAE's recent past, 'Henna' explores the effects the rapid development has on the Abu Rashid family. Henna's mother is sick, and her frequent fits have lead to a divorce. When her Bedouin relative arrives from the desert with his camels to visit the family, Henna will find in him a new father figure. But strained by the changing environment in the village he leaves, refusing to take Henna with him. With her only happy memory, a recent trip to the new mall in the city, Henna faces an uncertain future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235540</url></doc>
