<plot>The filmmaker goes on an expedition using a book by Gerhard Roth as travel guide: it is a voyage through the texts. He tells of an inner and an exterior voyage, an essayistic trip along the itineraries laid out by Roth: 1.) The house of sleeping reason (house of the artists in the asylum at Gugging) 2.) Leopold requiem (the fate of the Jews in Vienna) 3.) The gray house (the remand prison) 4.) "Hitler's Villa" (The homeless asylum in the Meldemannstrasse) 5.) The "Narrenturm" (located on the premises of the General Hospital; it was first an insane asylum and is now a pathological-anatomical museum) 6.) The St. Stephen's Cathedral 7.) The Museum of Army History 8.) The second city (subterranean Vienna) 9.) Berggasse 19 The nine stories told by Gerhard Roth are stories about Austria, encounters with people living on the border, about outsiders and outcasts. These are stories of dreams and illusions, of the other side of the golden dream which has been dreamed in Vienna for so long until it dissolved in thin air. A travel guide through the depths of the Austrian soul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?167823</url></doc>
