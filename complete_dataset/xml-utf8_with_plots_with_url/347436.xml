<plot>Bret Ellis is a writer whose first novel Less Than Zero catapulted him to international stardom while he was still in college. In the years that followed, he found himself adrift in a world of wealth, drugs, and fame, as well as dealing with the death of his abusive father. After a decade of decadence, a chance for salvation arrives; the chance to reconnect with an actress he was once involved with, and their son. But almost immediately his new life is threatened by a freak sequence of events and a bizarre series of murders that all seem to connect to Ellis' past. Reality, memoir, and fantasy combine to create not only a fascinating version of this most controversial writer but also a deeply moving story about love and loss, parents and children, and ultimately forgiveness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?347436</url></doc>
