<plot>This is a documentary in which we get to follow the researchers 'Tim Clutton-Brock' (qv) and 'Grant Malcolm McIlrath' (qv) from the universities of Cambridge and Pretoria, out on a routine research trip in the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa, with the meerkat family "Lazuli", who have gotten very used to them being around, since they've been studied since 1993 or '94, the Lazuli is also the first clan that they started studying. Some of the Lazulis that we get to know a bit include: Bulgarian (the dominant male), seven year old Zyzyphus (the dominant female), Figaro (the eldest son) and Lulu (the eldest daughter).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363608</url></doc>
