<plot>A young boy, Micah, mimics his father by pretending to be a psychologist to his friend and "patient," Cameron. The two have sessions on the playground during school in which Micah tries to solve Cameron's bike-riding problem. Dr. Donaldson, Micah's father, is a workaholic whose concern with his job surpasses the importance of connecting with his son. It is Micah who receives the advice when he learns from Cameron what a dad's job REALLY is: to play with his kids. Micah must get Dr. Donaldson to climb a tree in order to gain the much-needed attention from his father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067581</url></doc>
