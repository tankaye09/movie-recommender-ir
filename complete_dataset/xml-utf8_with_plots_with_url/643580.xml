<plot>Voodoo is the lifeblood of Haiti. It sparked the revolution that gave Haiti its independence in 1804. And today, it fires the imagination of a proud people beset by poverty, disease and repression. In fact, voodoo permeates every facet of Haitian culture. A form of African spirit worship, voodoo challenges the Roman Catholic church in Haiti for religious supremacy. But it also plays a political role: voodoo is linked to the communal movement now fighting for recognition in Haiti. And voodoo's rhythms are the driving force behind a new wave of Haitian popular music led by such groups as Boukman Eksperyans. Shot in Haiti in August, 1991, just two weeks before the brutal coup which overthrew democratically elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Voodoo is a sympathetic portrait of a tragic nation. Featuring dramatic footage of voodoo ceremonies and possession, the film seeks to reveal the truth about a much maligned and misunderstood religion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?643580</url></doc>
