<plot>The Pink Panther, chased by a dog catcher, seeks shelter in a house guarded by a vicious watchdog. To avoid being captured by the father and the two kids, he disguises himself as a toy. He tries to escape from the house, but can't because of the dog, so he has to alternate between being a toy, and making the best of the house's conveniences. The father, however, has constant trouble with the dog who keeps sneaking into the house trying to reveal the panther for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433306</url></doc>
