<plot>Allison Roberts travels to and from work, dulled by medication to suppress hallucinations. So isolated, her hallucinations become her only companion in life, in the form of a four foot tall cow man named Moo. Aside from Moo, Allison takes care of her aging father but tonight is her birthday and she is going to go out for a change. After a terrible and embarrassing night, Allison is mugged by a desperate man with a gun named Diggs Iggins. Later on, while going through her purse, he realizes it's her birthday and feels terrible. He returns Allison's belongings but unfortunately, for both of them, involves her in his escape from mobsters, who are looking for a stolen bag containing... half a million dollars. Allison against her better judgment finds Diggs endearing and begins to form a bond with this stranger who has shaken up her life. Although running for his life, Diggs, shows an uncommon interest in Allison and doesn't let her out of his sight. Through a series of events, they begin to realize that their lives and the lives of everyone they knew have been deeply intertwined. Dark secrets and family lies begin to surface as they become increasingly more dependent on each other to survive. Diggs, unaware of Allison's ailments and Allison, completely unaware of what is going on, are being chased through what will be... their last night in Brooklyn.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320583</url></doc>
