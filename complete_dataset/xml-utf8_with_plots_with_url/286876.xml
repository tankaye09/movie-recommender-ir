<plot>Originating on the island of Okinawa and migrating to mainland Japan in 1921, karate is a synthesis of indigenous Okinawan fighting methods and southern Chinese martial arts. Roughly translated a "The Way of the Empty Hand," it's best known for its explosive strikes, kicks, and punches. But body-to-body grappling and mat-pounding take-downs are also a large part of the highly effective arsenal belonging to the karate master. Now, meet nearly twenty of these young masters. Set in the Bukovina region of the Ukraine, this group of youngsters is an athletic wonder to behold. Suited up in the traditional "ghee" and ever mindful of time-honored civility, they bow gracefully before, and after, every match, but in between they're lean, mean, fighting machines - swift of mind and potentially lethal in their precision. Yet, when the workouts are over, the sweet nature of these kids is what really shines through. In nearby woods, they throw down a delectable picnic spread which they are most happy to share with a stray dog.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?286876</url></doc>
