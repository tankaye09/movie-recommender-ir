But Suraj does not like Preet, runs away from home, gets into a dance competition, wins it, also wins the heart of Anupriya, and wants to marry her. He convinces Raajmata to change her mind, and she finally relents. Before the marriage could take place, Anupriya's brother, Jeetu, is kidnapped and held for ransom for 50 Lakh Rupees, since she does not have the money, she asks Suraj for help, and the money is provided to her. Subsequently, they find the money missing and the lifeless body of Anupriya. Suraj must now find out who killed his sweetheart, and the only one to guide him appears to be an apparition - a ghost-like figure that resembles Anupriya - and the only clue is that she was shot dead by four different people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241064</url></doc>
