His mental and sometimes physical abuse, leaves her quiet and unable to tell her parents whats going on. Scared of her brothers reaction, she keeps to herself while trying to find comfort in her writing. Too young to escape her life, she often goes to find peace at her favorite spot, a cliff overlooking the ocean. Her silence is finally broken when she sees that Oscar has turned his violent temper toward her parents. It is then that she is forced to make a decision that will change the rest of her life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199915</url></doc>
