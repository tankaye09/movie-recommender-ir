<plot>Joe Smeal, a wheelchair-bound Glaswegian, spends his days in decrepit solitude in the top-floor flat of an East-End tower-block, wheeling himself from his bed to the TV, a can of lager never more than an arm's-reach away. With one answering-machine message he has a chance to change his life. The problem is he has to get to the West- End... today... and there's a bus strike! In this black-comedy, highlighting issues of disability and redemption, and set against the contrasting geography of Glasgow, can Joe wheel himself from one side of the city to the other... even with the help of a blind man!?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278033</url></doc>
