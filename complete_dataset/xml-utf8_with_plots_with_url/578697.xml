<plot>In this clone of "The Newlywed Game," five women, all said to be real-life neighbors, appeared as contestants. The game was played in two parts: Part one had host Philbin reading a piece of information, and it was up to one of the contestants to decide if it was about her or one of the neighbors. In part two, two of the contestants got to listen to gossip about her and had to decide which neighbor said it. Cash prizes were awarded for correct answers. The contestant with the most money at the end of the show won a bonus prize.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578697</url></doc>
