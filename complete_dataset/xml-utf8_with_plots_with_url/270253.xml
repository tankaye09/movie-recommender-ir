<plot>While many "elders" resort to a quieter life in their later years "polka people" refuse to surrender to the inevitable constraints of aging. In this documentary, each colorful character plays a different role in the polka scene, whether as a dancer, band leader, promoter, collector, or teacher, striving to stay young through that role. As their stories unwind, we see how they use this music to live rather than just be alive. While polka crowds are eager to show their enjoyment and dedication of their dance, one question remains: "In 20 years, who will run the dance halls, perform in the bands, and pounce the floors?" They clutch to a hope in the underground, younger generation, some of whom are standing ready to bear the stereotypes and ridicule they face when, instead of going to the local mall on Saturday night, they proceed to the nearest polka hall. A universal theme of passing one's heritage to the next generation is evident.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270253</url></doc>
