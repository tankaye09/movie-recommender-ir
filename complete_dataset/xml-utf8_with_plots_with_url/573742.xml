<plot>Luke is a young man, he is 24. He has simple life and lives in the suburb of Amsterdam. Luke has also a girlfriend that he's known since he was a kid. Every day he and his buddies go to a pool centre. Their motto is "live today and not tomorrow". But Luke has a dream - he wants to become a director. He is currently following an expensive filmmaking course. For a project for the course he needs to work together with Marlene. She has a more complex life and is from a different social class. Together they decide to do this project  - Marlene will cover the making of Luke's movie as Luke decides to make a film about himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573742</url></doc>
