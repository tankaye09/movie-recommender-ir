<plot>"String Theory" is a ten-minute comedy about the ups and downs of dating in the internet age. Lisa and Steve are two lonely, urban professionals who meet through an on-line dating service. They've emailed, exchanged photos and spoken over the phone. And now, after their internet courtship, they're about to meet face to face for the first time. Meeting at an upscale cocktail lounge with a romantic view of the skyline, Lisa and Steve talk over drinks. Stories are shared, secrets are spilled and a connection is made. In the end, both of them are in for a big surprise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518522</url></doc>
