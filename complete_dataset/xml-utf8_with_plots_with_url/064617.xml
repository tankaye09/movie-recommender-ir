<plot>Based on a true story, Belle Gunness is the story of America's first known mass murderess. With the outward appearance of a proper lady of means, Belle Gunness lures men to her farm with promises of matrimony and prosperity. Many men arrived and none were ever seen again. A manipulated farm hand complicit in the goings on begins to weaken with guilt. Fearful that she will be exposed, Belle knows what she has to do. The horrific discoveries made on the farm following a spectacular fire remain a mystery to this day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064617</url></doc>
