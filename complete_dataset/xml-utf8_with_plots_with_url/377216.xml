<plot>When one of his clients can't afford his fees, a big time Las Vegas child custody lawyer accepts a house as a suitable substitute. There, the lawyer meets Opal Dunn, a deeply religious woman who has a premonition about his family's destruction, but who believes that all things will pass if you have faith. Around the same time, his life falls apart. He has to remember Opal's teachings before he will be able to overcome his hardships. This is a compelling story of a man's love for his family, as he goes from arrogance to humility and into a journey of faith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377216</url></doc>
