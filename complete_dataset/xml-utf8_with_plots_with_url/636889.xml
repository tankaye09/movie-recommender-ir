<plot>It's 2049, the human population of Earth has embarked a migratory voyage to try and colonize other planets. The Earth's cities, forests, icecaps are beginning to foul with toxic sludge! The villainous powerful dictator orbot, known as Warhead is born, and he stands for tyranny, hatred and oppression. He declares himself ruler of Earth, and prepares to execute any humans who dare return to their planet! But only one orbot, by the name of Vectorman, who is cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. He finds chaos and confusion! Because all the other Orbots are controlled by Warhead, and Vectorman will take it upon himself to destroy the errant orbot and restore peace to Earth once again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?636889</url></doc>
