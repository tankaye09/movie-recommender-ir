<plot>Manay Po tells the story of Luz, a small time jeweler who dreams of making it big so as to provide a better life for her family. Her life revolves around her brood of three, namely, Oscar, Orson and Orwell and her live-in boyfriend Gerry. With the help of her good friend and maid Maritess, Luz was able to raise her children normally despite the absence of a husband. Or so she thought.. Oscar is a rising architect from a major firm and is betrothed to be married to his girlfriend of five years Pauleen. Unknown to Luz and everyone else, Oscar is a closet homosexual and is keeping his relationship with engineer best friend Adrian Pengson a secret. Orson, on the other hand, is openly gay, much to Oscar's discomfort. He is fun-loving, sweet and engaged in numerous extracurricular activities in school. His one true love is his best friend Marky, whom he always tries to impress by lavishing him with affection. Then there's Orwell - a young teener who is at crossroads with regard to his sexuality. Due to his confusion, Orwell pretty much keeps to himself. As such, Luz and his two brothers are clueless about his real identity. In spite of her children's questionable sexualities, their family paints a picture of a happy family - a home filled with laughter and unconditional love. Then one day, a family crisis involving stolen jewelry jolts Luz out of her seemingly perfect existence. She decides to keep it a secret from her children, wanting to shield them from any form of worry. With Gerry's help, Luz tries her best to keep the semblance of normalcy within the household and at the same time keeping the family together. In the end, revelations come tumbling one after the other and Luz finds herself faced with a decision that will shape the future of her family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355763</url></doc>
