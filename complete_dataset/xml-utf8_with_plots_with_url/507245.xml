<plot>Jim Brandon, foreman of the Wind River Ranch owned by Martin Stavnow is in love with "Ronnie", the owner's daughter. Jim is unaware that Harvey, a young cowhand that Jim protects like a brother,also loves the girl, and the shy Jim asks Harvey to speak for him. The heart-broken Harvey joins the rustling gang led by "Red' Slade, who are plotting a raid on the Wind River's herd. Harvey is killed while Jim is trying to rescue him from the gang. The rustling attempt is stopped and Slade takes refuge in a wagon in which "Ronnie" is hiding. Jim and his horse Tarzan rescue her just before the wagon plunges over a cliff with Slade riding to his doom. Tarzan (the horse) is even smarter than usual in this one; he knows when and how to duck bullets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?507245</url></doc>
