<plot>Mr. Blue is the story of two men stuck in a limbo between life and death. They are confined to bed in a hospital room, with nothing but white walls surrounding them. In this desolate setting, MR. BLUE, a dying man, manages to generate hope in his roommate, MR. YELLOW. Mr. Yellow is paralyzed after an accident and cannot see the outside world, because a curtain dividing the room blocks his view. Passing on striking visions to Mr. Yellow from his bed by the window, Mr. Blue slowly guides Mr. Yellow to free his mind from paralysis. Inspired by these visions, Mr. Yellow is able to rise above his handicap, regaining his curiosity and excitement for life. But when Mr. Blue dies, will Mr. Yellow be able to capture what lies beyond the window?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379516</url></doc>
