<plot>StareMaster: The Movie (65min documentary, 2003) dramatizes to absurdity the final night in a weeklong tour by the StareMaster project, a live-action game show in which combatants attempt to stare one another down through a barrage of distractions. The action unfolds in the sleepy Southern town of Pensacola, FL, where the filmmakers follow eight participants as they compete against one another for the title of StareMaster2002. With a deadpan sense of seriousness and purpose, the film delivers a riotous critique of popular entertainment. Without resorting to heavy-handed polemics, it calls into question the increasingly arbitrary distinction between spectators and the spectacle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513924</url></doc>
