<plot>While Benny is in jail his old henchman Monk takes over the gang and Benny's girl Frieda. Once out Benny wants nothing to do with either. He has reformed and is beloved of his god-fearing mother's good friend Bertha. But Frieda pursues him and, at a party, announces her engagement to Monk in order to make Benny really jealous. A rival gang attacks during the party and Benny takes over, running off with Bertha in his arms. In a chase across the rooftops, Monk falls to his death. Benny is accused and later cleared of Monk's "murder".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201606</url></doc>
