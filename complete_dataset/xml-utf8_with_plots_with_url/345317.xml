<plot>It is love at first sight between Juliet (Marian Marsh) and Allan (Claude Hulbert) as they catch sight of each other on passing trains. Allan has his song-writing friend Bill (Anthony Bushell) to write a song of the incident and he has it broadcast. Juliet, through the hints provided in the song, responds and comes to Allan's home, where he is working on a safety-match invention. A lab accident destroys her dress and Allan rushes out to get her a new one, while she stays at his house in a pair of pajamas. Bill drops by and the love-at-second sight of the title comes into play. Before long, Juliet realizes it is Bill she loves, and all ends happily as ol' Allan finds his true love in his over-looked assistant, Evelyn (Joan Gardner.)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345317</url></doc>
