<plot>How close have you come to witnessing a dark secret that could change your life... forever? What if all it took was a glance, a peek over the neighbor's fence, or a stroll down a dark suburban road to set in motion a series of irreversible events? Rebecca, a smart, young, impressionable student encounters Christian, a tall, handsome, mysterious stranger with worldly charm. Impressed by his apparent success, Rebecca is drawn to him, and perhaps too close to learning his secret. A secret that must be kept... at all costs. The right glimpse, the right look over her shoulder, could unleash Christian's sinister intentions on the unsuspecting Rebecca. What did Rebecca really see and how will she react?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261154</url></doc>
