<plot>Armed with determination, talent and multi-tasking skills, we follow Jodi Nelson and her bandmates from the beginning, as we get a front row seat to experience what it takes to be an artist in today's competitive and ever-changing DIY music business. From writing sessions to rehearsals, recording in the studio, shooting a Live Television show to roadtripping to Austin - this documentary is a refreshing look at the work, guts, raw talent and stamina it takes to make dreams become reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270553</url></doc>
