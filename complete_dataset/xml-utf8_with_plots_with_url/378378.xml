<plot>Demira is an actor in porno-movies and the despondent son of a mother who smothers him with love. To get over his obsession of calling her up after every sexual encounter, Demira goes to a psychiatrist. Given his homosexual tendencies, the inevitable happens with the doctor. Naturally he calls his mother - Esther, a brassy blond - who arrives in town for a visit. But Esther, who has visions of Hollywood for her son, also has something of a life of her own. In fact, her current romantic reverie makes her oblivious to her son's depression. Her jealous offspring fails to attract her attention by various antics. Nevermind, his big break has come: he'll be the star she's always wanted him to be. Unfortunately the script written "just for him" is like all the others - sexually and artistically humiliating. Suddenly he's walking off the set, although the cameras are rolling and the director is screaming. Is this a take of Demira cutting the umbilical cord?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378378</url></doc>
