<plot>Casey gets out of bed while asleep, walks to the window, raises the sash and steps out on the sill. The scene changes and Casey is seen walking along the edge of the roof. He finally loses his balance and rolls over the side of the roof. The climax of this picture is reached when Casey is seen rolling from the bed on to the floor. This awakens him, and seizing the bottle of whiskey, he falls on his knees and offers up a prayer at finding it was all a dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095862</url></doc>
