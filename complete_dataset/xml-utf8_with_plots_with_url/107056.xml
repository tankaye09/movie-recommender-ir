<plot>Ever thought about running away to join the circus? Well, think again. You might end up on the road with the talent-free all-punk misery-magnet known as the Circus Redickuless. Deformed brainchild of impresario Chicken John, the Circus Redickuless showcases a rag-tag team of users, losers, and abusers who constantly complain, fight over drugs, and shirk all hygienic responsibilities. Circus Redickuless takes you places The Real World never could as the circus travels a trail of grease-painted tears. See the sorrowful sideshow play to an audience of five lonely kids at a youth rehab center. Marvel as a diseased, cheek-pierced clown wears under-pants over her head to hide a severe inflammation. Watch in wonder and dismay as gig after gig is canceled, forcing the pathetic circus to play at a trash dump and paint stripes in a parking lot for food. In the grand tradition of circus life (grifters, scammers, and desperate living), Circus Redickuless lives up to its name.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107056</url></doc>
