<plot>A world that's more riot than profession, the trading floors of Chicago are a place where gambling your family's mortgage is all in a day's. At a time when markets are unhinged, FLOORED offers a unique window to this lesser-known world of finance. These men may not have degrees, but they've got guts, and penchant for excess that solicits simultaneous feelings of revulsion- and a desire to root them on. But like many aspects of our economy, technology is changing the way these traders do business, and these eccentric pit denizens aren't the type to take kindly to new tricks. Computerized trading may take the emotion out of the job, but it may also take some of these old-timers out- dinosaurs in a young man's game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197983</url></doc>
