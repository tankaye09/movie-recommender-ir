<plot>For a 'modelle', Michelle Marsh is surprising in quite a few ways: she's talkative, funny and has an endearing warmth that will long prevail after her more obvious physical assets have waned a little with the inevitable onset of age. In this role as a modern day agony aunt she is perfect, especially as she is challenged and cajoled by her experienced producer Richard Alexander in to being more honest and candid than most people ever could be when talking about sex and relationships. This unusual combination of on-screen beauty and wit, proves to be entertaining and humorous, coupled nicely with palatable dips into the world of reality. A well presented &amp; funny program.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?593091</url></doc>
