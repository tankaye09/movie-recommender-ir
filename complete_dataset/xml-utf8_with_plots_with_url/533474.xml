<plot>Barbara, the daughter of a poor farmer, receives an invitation from her sister, who is away at college, to come for a visit. Barbara is mortified, however, when she discovers she can't go because she doesn't have the proper clothes. Frantic for fashion tips, she and her mother naturally visit the local agricultural agent, who advises Barbara to make her own clothes. She proceeds to do just that on her sewing machine, and soon has enough of a wardrobe to not only properly visit her sister, but apparently word of her accomplishment has filtered up to the governor, who invites her to a tea party at his mansion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?533474</url></doc>
