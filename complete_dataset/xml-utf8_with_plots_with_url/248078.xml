<plot>Jake and Andrew don't know where they're going, and it doesn't really matter. Over a game of basketball and a pint of Jack Daniel's, they decide to leave New York. Jake is trying to escape the girl who broke his heart, and has turned to sportswriting. Andrew is out of control and running from his Wall Street success. A taxi cab, $500, and a pair of shoes later they are in Philadelphia, looking to steal a relative's car. "How I Got Lost" is about a generation going through a quarter-life crisis -- they were the kids who were supposed to be great. It's about Jake and Andrew, who don't know which way to go, and have to find their own way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248078</url></doc>
