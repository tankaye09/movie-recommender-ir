<plot>Reginald Bunthorne is a poet, adored by all the ladies - except one. Patience, a dairymaid, cannot understand what all the other ladies see in him and wonders what love is. However, despite her indifference to him, Bunthorne is in love with Patience and wants to marry her. Things are further complicated when another poet, Archibald Grosvenor, (a childhood friend of Patience) comes upon the scene and becomes a rival for Patience's hand. Archibald is immediately adored by all but one of the ladies (Lady Jane). The smitten ladies forsake Bunthorne in their pursuit of their new love, while Lady Jane continues to pursue her unresponsive target. Meanwhile the ladies are pursued, in turn, by their cavalry fiances, who patiently hope to win back their promised brides from the grasp of the two poets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425980</url></doc>
