<plot>Living alone in a dingy studio apartment, Keira is a poor street musician. Having recently taken a job busing tables at a trendy downtown restaurant, she spends most of her free time reading, day-dreaming and composing the sprawling, noisy, experimental sound-scapes that she performs for no one in particular in city subway stations. Becoming more ambitious, she decides to audition a "singer", the homeless, alternately charming and infuriating extrovert, Josh. He and the shy Keira soon begin a tenuous relationship and musical collaboration. As the fundamental differences between the two begin to strain their relationship - and the desperate reality of her existence begins to intrude upon her creative dream-world - Keira finds herself at the edge of mental collapse. Busgirl is the story of a young artist trying to come to grips with a world where her creative spirit is seen as having no intrinsic value, and where those lacking the ability and inclination to sell themselves are forced to the margins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087491</url></doc>
