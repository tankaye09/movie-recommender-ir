<plot>Arcade Zone is a collection of 17 classic arcade games laid out through 4 zones set in a fictional arcade. Playing as one of the 8 colorful young characters, players will progress by earning high score tokens which will unlock the Arcade Zone Employees (bosses) in each fun and vibrant section of the arcade. After defeating all of the Arcade Zone employees players will battle head to head against the "Arcade Master" himself for a shot at his illustrious title.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044690</url></doc>
