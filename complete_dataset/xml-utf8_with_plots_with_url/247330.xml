<plot>In a suburban community, Rusty, a small put-upon mutt, gets a new neighbor with a gorgeous poodle who is recently retired from the movie business. Unfortunately, the more macho dogs approach her first for a date and Rusty accepts the inevitable. That night, the head dog's drunken advances severely offend her and she runs off after clobbering him. Rusty finds the inconsolable poodle, and he charms her with his witty nature and honest efforts to show her to a good time to cheer her up. It suddenly seems things are looking up for them, provided if Rusty can get back home before his guardians find out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247330</url></doc>
