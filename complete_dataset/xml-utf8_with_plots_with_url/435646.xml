<plot>Liza, a reclusive artist, must conceive a painting for her gallery debut. She tries to concentrate on her creation but a mysterious guitar player clouds her focus. He tries to approach her as she checks her mail, but she runs away, untrusting of his advances. Eventually he invades her dreams with his music and inspires her to paint with newfound passion. She decides to seek out her persistent player and ask him to pose for her. With him, she'll learn that creating art becomes much more rewarding when viewed as a game of two.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435646</url></doc>
