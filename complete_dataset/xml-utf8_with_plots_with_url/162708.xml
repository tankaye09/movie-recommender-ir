<plot>This is a different film about the Romanians, a film in which they do not whine and do not beg. The Romanians from the village of Orizare, Sliven region, and from the village of Marchevo -situated some 300 km away, in Gotze Delchev region, are trying to take a control over their fate regardless of the hardships encountered. Taking the challenges that modern life faces them with, they are trying to achieve their goal - to squeeze out of ocean of desperation without losing face.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162708</url></doc>
