<plot>A portly gentleman enters the masseur's apartment, and being divested of his clothing, lies down on a slab to be massaged. After a few passes over him he arises minus his avoirdupois. The attendant clothes him again and dismisses him. A very funny effect in this picture is the novel method in which the patient's clothes are taken off and put on with magical effects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?324933</url></doc>
