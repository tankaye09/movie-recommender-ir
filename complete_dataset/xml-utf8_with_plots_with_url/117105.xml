<plot>A former Norseman pub manager was charged with the manslaughter of Kevin Rule, a member of the Ngadju Nation, but later found not guilty. The dead man's partner, Daniella Borg, is certain the manager's lethal punch killed Kevin and feels the Australian Judicial System has not provided her with justice. Daniella has decided to have a re-trial. This time it is to be set on Kevin's lands, within the framework of the oldest law in the land. The case is going before an Indigenous Customary Law Court. Posing the question - what if the Australian legal system was not based on the British model but rather on one of the oldest Law systems in the world, Indigenous Australian Customary Law?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117105</url></doc>
