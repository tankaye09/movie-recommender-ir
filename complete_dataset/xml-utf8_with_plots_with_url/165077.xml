<plot>Dave MacLeod is looking for the hardest challenges in traditional rock climbing. He finds a perfect project on the north face of Ben Nevis. Dave and his wife Claire move house to the foot of the mountain and Claire films his training, thoughts and eventual success on the Echo Wall project over the course of a year, including possibly the hardest free solo in the world (Darwin Dixit 8c). Although ungraded, Echo Wall is likely the hardest trad route in the world. A thoughtful and atmospheric story of hard effort, dedication and outlook on risk, set in beauty of Ben Nevis and Lochaber.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165077</url></doc>
