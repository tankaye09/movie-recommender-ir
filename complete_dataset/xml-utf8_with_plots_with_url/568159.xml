<plot>Diaper Dampsey (Georgie Smith) has fought his way to the "Diaperweight" boxing championship, always with his sweetheart (Shirley Temple) at ringside to cheer him on. In fact, she's his good luck charm, and he can't fight without her there. With his championship on the line, his opponent, "Pop Skull" McGee (Lawrence Harris) has kidnapped Shirley to make sure he'll lose. Thanks to Dampsey's manager and a clever dog, Shirley is rescued, but will she make it to the arena in time to help Diaper Dampsey win the day?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568159</url></doc>
