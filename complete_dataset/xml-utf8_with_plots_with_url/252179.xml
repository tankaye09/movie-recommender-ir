<plot>Everyone owns a "Finky." A small, rounded creature that was returned to Earth years ago aboard the first manned mission to Mars expedition. Several different species of Finky make up their race, each possessing its own distinctive characteristics by which they are named after: Resonators react to sound; Scenters spin wildly when exposed to odor; Tactiles are stimulated by touch; Reactors respond to visual movement and Pulsators do nothing but...pulsate. All is fun and games until one day the Finky's reveal a darker and more sinister side. The docile critters start to metamorphose into grotesque, slimy blobs and begin escaping...but to where? Resident scientist Dr. Harlock draws a fatal conclusion as to why this is happening. Before it's too late, Dr. Harlock, together with ten year old Willy Popcorn race against time to prevent a worldwide catastrophe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252179</url></doc>
