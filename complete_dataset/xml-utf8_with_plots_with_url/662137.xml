<plot>X-Gold combines its predecessors X: Beyond the Frontier and X-Tension into a unique, Elite like game. You start with a small ship in a 3d realtime space environment and fly through the galaxy which is filled with alien races, some are friendly while others are evil. The trading option offers you to earn lots of credits, you can buy goods and sell them at a later point in the game to different space stations and factories. You can upgrade your ship or buy a new one with many different features, weapons and other components. Build up new factories and send your own fleet into space battles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662137</url></doc>
