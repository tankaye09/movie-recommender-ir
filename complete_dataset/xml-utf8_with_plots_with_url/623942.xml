<plot>"Taken at the Dry Tortugas, and shows the most powerful fighting machine in the world today as she lies at anchor taking on coal. The decks are covered with marines and sailors. An immense barge lies along side, from which a large gang of negroes are hustling 'King Coal' into the the battleship, on whose decks the coal passers run to and fro. The view is taken from a moving yacht and gives the effect of the vessel itself passing through the water. As the yacht passed the starboard quarter, the powerful 13-inch, 8-inch and 6-inch guns bristle from their turrets. She looks every inch of her great length, 348 feet. The photograph is excellent."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623942</url></doc>
