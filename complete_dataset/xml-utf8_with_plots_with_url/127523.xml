<plot>Darkwing Duck has been summoned by the chairman of HUSH, J. Gander-Hooter, for another daredevil mission. Four of Saint Carnards most notorious villains (Moliarty, Tuskerninni, Megavolt and Steelbeak) have joined forces. A secret photo of one of their meetings shows them studying an oil painting. Are they planning art theft or is it something much worse. The criminals have cut the painting into 36 pieces, divided them among themselves and fled back to their own sectors. The chief believes that this painting will reveal the true intentions of the crime bosses. Darkwing Duck 'the terror that flaps in the night' must track down the crooks, recover the pieces and put the painting back together for SHUSH.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127523</url></doc>
