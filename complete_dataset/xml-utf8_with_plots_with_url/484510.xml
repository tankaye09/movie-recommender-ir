<plot>Seeking Happily Ever After is a feature-length documentary that reveals how millions of 30-something single women are busting cultural norms while redefining happy endings for themselves. At this unique moment in history, there are over 6.3 million single women in their 30s in the U.S. For the past several years, the media has painted them as either desperate to get married or so career-driven that they "don't need a man." This documentary will finally allow women to speak up collectively about the realities of what seeking "Happily Ever After" looks like in today's climate. We'll see the pressures they face, the hopes they have, and the ups and downs of giving themselves permission to avoid settling when it comes to picking a spouse. This hip and illuminating film will explore how women are changing finance, entertainment, pop culture and politics--and the way girls and women redefine "Happily Ever After."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484510</url></doc>
