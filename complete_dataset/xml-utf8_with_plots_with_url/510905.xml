<plot>THE SPLIT HORN is the sweeping story of a Hmong shaman and his family living in Appleton, Wisconsin. Documenting the journey of Paja Thao and his family from the mountains of Laos to the heartland of America, this poignant film shows a shaman's struggle to maintain his ancient traditions as his children embrace American culture. America has become the testing ground for the enduring strength of Hmong culture. The evocative narrative captures the daily struggle of Paja Thao's family caught between two worlds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510905</url></doc>
