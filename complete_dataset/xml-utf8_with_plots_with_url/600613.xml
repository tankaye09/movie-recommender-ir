<plot>On Long Island, an elderly woman in a wheelchair wants to see Long Beach. At the beach, she is pushed along the boardwalk by a nurse. They arrive at a ramp. At this point, the nurse bends over and accidentally bumps the wheelchair which is set in motion, propelling the elderly lady into a series of encounters with a priest and others as the wheelchair continues to spin and gyrate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600613</url></doc>
