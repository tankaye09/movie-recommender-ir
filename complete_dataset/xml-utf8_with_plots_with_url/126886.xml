<plot>Nahar Singh comes from the middle-class section of society. He goes out into the wide world to look for a job but does not find one. So he visits the church (Mandir) everyday to pray that he finds a job. One day luck was in his favour when he sees some goons beating up a man; he attempts to help the man and beats the goons up. Later on it was found out that the man was a plain clothes police officer named Ajhar Singh. Ajhar Singh admires Nahar's guts and speak to him about joining the police force, which he does. He becomes a strict police officer who does not accept bribe or do any illegal deeds and this put him on the hit list of the criminals especially Tom Alter who wants him dead or alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126886</url></doc>
