<plot>When Steve learns he has mysteriously inherited a large farm in the small, eerie town of Trout Creek, the twenty-five year old and his two friends set out to investigate. Ignoring their uneasy feeling, they pitch their tents and prepare to spend the night. The moment Steve falls asleep, images of his nightmarish childhood come back to haunt him. This student film is now the 2005 Peoples Choice Award Winner for the Fire Island Golden Wagon Film Festival. Director Matthew Sullivan and Cinematographer and Executive Producer Patrick Smith, both come from Emerson College where together they wrote "Trout Creek."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619262</url></doc>
