<plot>In this sports short from 20th Century-Fox, sportscaster Mel Allen gives a glimpse at some of the great moments and players in college football history, all winners of the Heisman Trophy. Players shown in their college days include Michigan's Tom Harmon, Minnesota's Bruce Smith, Princeton's Dick Kazmaier, Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, and Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis from West Point/Army. Kazmaier and Lujack were the only two, mentioned above, that never had a feature-length film based on their lives and gridiron exploits, i.e., "Harmon of Michigan", "Smith of Minnesota" and "The Spirit of West Point." Based on those films, Kazmaier and Lujack were fortunate. Other past winners shown were SMU's Doak Walker; Jay Berwinger from the University of Chicago (the only major American-university that abandoned football); Larry Kelly of Yale, and the 1953 Heisman Trophy winner, Johnny Lattner of Notre Dame.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511172</url></doc>
