<plot>An entry in Universal's "Persons/Oddities" series of shorts featuring well-known comic strip artists and how they turn out their daily newspaper comic strips. This one is more interesting than most in the series as it features people most of the audience was aware of, and not some guy named Joe Blow in Malibu making earrings out of driftwood. Among those featured are "Terry and the Pirates" creator Milton Caniff, shortly before he quit that strip and created "Steve Canyon"; Harold Gray of "Little Orphan Annie" fame, plus Bill Holman and his "Smokey Stover" strip and Walter Brandt who was reponsible for the "Smitty and Herby" features.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351512</url></doc>
