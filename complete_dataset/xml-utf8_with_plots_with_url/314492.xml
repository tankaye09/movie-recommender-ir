<plot>Prudence and Maurice have been in love since many years. They are both from Congo and live in Paris. Although Prudence is sterile and old, Maurice loves her. Everything in their lives is going to be put upside down when Maurice's parents decide to force Maurice to mary a girl from his hometown : although respectable, Prudence is not able to give any child to Maurice and this would be a shame to his family. Maurice is then in front of a dilemma : hurt his wife, or hurt his family. When Therese, the young girl, arrives in France, Maurice decides to tell Prudence she is his cousin. He first wants to find her a place and a job and then get rid of her. But one day, Prudence flyes to America to a cook contest, and Therese uses this time while Maurice is vulnerable to seduce him. When Prudence comes back in France, it is already too late : Therese is already pregnant, and Maurice's and Prudence's love broken.
