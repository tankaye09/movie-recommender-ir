<plot>Abel, a little child whose entire lifetime has been surrounded by nature, close to a small village, arrives to the big city after his father's death. There he will experience the abandonment of a mother whose memory he has lost, or the sudden loss of his only brother, Mario, a teenager, whose anxious will of change begin to lead him through violent paths. In his loneliness, the company of a beggar he finds everyday in his way to school, whose glance reminds him of his father, and whose presence seems to cease the grief provoked by that absence, will become his one and only shelter. But the beggar's presence becomes extremely awkward to Mario. Abel will be forced to choose among them, finding himself absolutely alone at the end to go on growing up, and carrying the sad weight of guilt, which his little child's mind still cannot thoroughly understand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319881</url></doc>
