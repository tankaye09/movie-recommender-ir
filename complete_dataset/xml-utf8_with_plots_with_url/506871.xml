<plot>Ivan is Russian, his neighbor Assan is Kazakh. They live in a small village in Kazakhstan. When Ivan's wife gets pregnant and gives birth to a brown boy, he suspects that she has been cheating on him with Assan. Half a year later, Assan's wife gives birth to a ginger boy. Whom betrayed whom? A conflict is sparked that won't fully rest for 15 years. Marat Sulu's script goes deep under the surface of a Russian - Kazakh family story - profoundly, emotionally and disrespectfully.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506871</url></doc>
