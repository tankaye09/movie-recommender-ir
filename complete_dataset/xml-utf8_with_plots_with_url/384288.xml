<plot>On Adam's last day of summer before leaving for college he sits by the pool, admiring from a distance his high school crush. Jamie Winters, popular, beautiful, and everything Adam is not sits writing in her journal only a few feet away from him. As he day dreams about her she drops her pen, and as it rolls against his foot he is faced with the awkward dilemma of being able to go and speak to her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384288</url></doc>
