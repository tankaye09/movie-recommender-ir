<plot>"This is a mystery picture. A burglar enters an old maid's bedroom by means of the window, and hearing someone approach, crawls under the bed. The old maid enters and sits down to remove her shoes. As she does so she sees the form of the man under the bed. Delighted at her discovery she proceeds to lock the door, and drags him out from his hiding place. To her chagrin and mortification, what she supposed to be a man proves to be nothing but a stuffed dummy."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553577</url></doc>
