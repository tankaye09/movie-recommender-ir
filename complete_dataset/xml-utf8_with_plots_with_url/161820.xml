<plot>We here present what we believe to be one of the most perfect pieces of animated photography ever made. The steamer Corona is seen approaching for a distance of about one-half mile down the St. Lawrence River. Smoke is pouring from her funnels and she comes up to the wharf under full steam, approaching our camera within a distance of about 25 feet. The gangplank is then run out and the Duke and Duchess step ashore, followed by hundreds of tourists and passengers of all descriptions. An immense crowd is congregated on the wharf to await the arrival of the Duke and Duchess, and they depart amid cheering and waving of hats and handkerchiefs. The scene ends by showing the special trolley car which conveyed the Duke and Duchess to Niagara Falls departing from the wharf. The car is followed by an immense crowd of men and boys. This picture is so perfect photographically that the heavy clouds which invariable hang over Niagara Falls are plainly discernable as they move against the sky.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161820</url></doc>
