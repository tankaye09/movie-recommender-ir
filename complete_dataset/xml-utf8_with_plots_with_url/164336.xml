<plot>Saving the environment has never been so deadly for the kids of Harmony High. After seven high-school students fail their biology final, Dr. Bob (Mark Hamill), takes them on a forced weekend of environmental clean-up in order to graduate. Unfortunately, their good deeds spawn a series of grisly murders that leaves you wondering if it's really safe to recycle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164336</url></doc>
