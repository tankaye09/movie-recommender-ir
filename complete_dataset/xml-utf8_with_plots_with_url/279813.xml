<plot>The project, "Journal for Jordan," is based on Dana Canedy's essay, which describes a 200-page journal penned by her fianc√©, 1st Sgt. Charles Monroe King, for their son. The 48-year-old soldier was killed in Baghdad in October, one month shy of finishing his tour of duty. He had left for the Middle East before his son was born.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279813</url></doc>
