<plot>Marathon Pictures is stuck with Billy Doran (Darryl Hickman), Whiz Quiz radio show star but a flop in Hollywood. Ex-child star Tiny Barlow (Jackie Cooper) suggests that the studio remake "Skippy", the film that made him famous, with himself as coach for little Billy. A. J. Colder (Walter Abel), Marathon's Mighty Mogul, agrees. Joan Winslow (Susanna Foster), a contract player who has never had a part, is picked to replace balky Brenda Lee (Ann Gillis) in Marathon's monster musical of the year. Tiny poses as a big shot and takes credit for getting Joan the role. They are soon seen everywhere together as Tiny is taking advantage of her publicity build-up for his own gain, until he suddenly finds out he is in love with her and confesses his duplicity. This occurs when Colder has forbid Joan to see Tiny anymore, directing her to only be seen with important people who can help her career, and Tiny thinks it is because she has dumped him. He enters into a conspiracy with Brenda's agent, Mickey Fadden (John Gallaudet), to make Brenda give up her strike and accept the role Colder gave Joan. She does and Tiny is given the role of her leading man. But he is unhappy about what he has done in costing Joan her big chance, plus his old friend, Georgie Clemons (Jackie Searle) who used to play the mean kid in Tiny's films is also replaced. Faced with the taunts of the production crew because of what he helped engineer and broken hearted about Joan, Tiny walks out on the picture, climbs into his automobile and heads for parts unknown. Little Billy, who adores him, stows away in the luggage compartment. Billy, the high IQ kid, has devised a scheme to set everything right.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216691</url></doc>
