<plot>Nicole is eleven and at that age when anything a parent does is devastatingly embarrassing, and it doesn't help that her parents actually ARE embarrassing. Mum has just caused total disaster by interrupting the school day to hand deliver Nicole's lunch box to her. Dad is insisting on a weekend fishing trip, despite the fact that his daughter is vegetarian. Her sister Samantha is a typical little snot-nosed kid who doesn't make matters any better. On her way home from school one day, after a series of embarrassing moments with each of her family members, Nicole notices her neighbors' hard rubbish collections. She sees old cupboards, televisions, bikes, all sorts of useless, unwanted, and embarrassing junk. She can think of a few things that are unwanted, embarrassing, and useless. It's time for the family to go, it's time to take out the trash.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230126</url></doc>
