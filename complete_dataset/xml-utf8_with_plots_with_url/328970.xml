<plot>In the seventh (actually sixth, as there was no number 4) installment of Al Lowe's favorite alter-ego, Leisure Suit Larry embarks on a sea cruise where there are more than enough beautiful women for Larry to encounter. His primary objective is to bed the most beautiful trophy on the ship: Captain Thygh. All he has to do to win her favors is to score high in the shipboard contests of bowling, cooking, horseshoes, fashion, craps and sexual prowess. If the gamer is also clever, Larry can find ways to cheat his way to the top of these events. Although the game is filled with blatant innuendo and puns (the likes of Drew Baringmore, Jamie Lee Coitus, Dewmi Moore, Nailmi and Wydoncha Jugg) there is no full frontal nudity (at least close-up) and the sexual encounters are inoffensive. This is a game with more tease than sleaze, as has always been the case with the Larry series. Backgrounds, animations, and sound have all been upgraded, as well as the interface, from icons to pop-up windows. Some may not enjoy a politically incorrect game with a hero who is shallow and sexually obsessed, but for those who do, Love for Sail is a must; Al Lowe's final -- and best -- Leisure Suit Larry ever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328970</url></doc>
