<plot>In 1975, twelve year old Jack and his friends on Taylor Drive in Portland, CT spend their days playing kickball, skipping rocks on the river and riding their bikes around the neighborhood. Riding bikes is a way of life for the kids on Taylor Drive, and every kid on the street is judged by which hills in the neighborhood they have conquered on their bikes. Join Jack in his quest to be the first kid from Taylor Drive to be able to ride his bike all the way to the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood, the hill that separates the "little kids" from the "big kids", Indian Hill.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264300</url></doc>
