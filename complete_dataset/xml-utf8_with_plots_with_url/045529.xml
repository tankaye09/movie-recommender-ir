<plot>A small US Army contingent has been sent to the Atlantic island of Sahrani with the purpose of helping to train the army of the local pro-American monarchy. The Kingdom of South Sahrani, rich in natural resources, has always been at odds with its Northern neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Sahrani. In recent years however, the situation has settled into an uneasy yet peaceful coexistence. But the Democratic Republic of Sahrani sees the training of Southern troops by the US as a threat. When they learn that the US troops have finished their deployment and are in the process of shipping out, the North prepares to strike while a false sense of security still occupies the minds of their Southern neighbors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045529</url></doc>
