<plot>In which a milkmaid is seen milking a cow, when a dude comes along and attempts to kiss her. She repels him, but he insists and finally succeeds in kissing her several times. She resents his familiarity by throwing the contents of her milk pail all over him. A very funny picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619202</url></doc>
