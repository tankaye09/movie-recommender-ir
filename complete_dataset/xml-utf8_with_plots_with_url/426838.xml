<plot>Contestants compete for a cash prize. They compete with their loser stories of bad luck and reveal who helped them out when they were down. The story that seemed most lame wins, but the prize money goes to the person that helped them out, and whom they have never paid back, hence the title "Pay It Back"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426838</url></doc>
