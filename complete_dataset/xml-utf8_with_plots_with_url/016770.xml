<plot>Swampwater, Florida is a quaint, little town that is only, on average, two feet under water. That, by itself, has never deterred a long list of misguided stalwarts, dimwits and crooks from trying to find fame and fortune there. Shooting a documentary in this soggy town, proves to be tougher than DW, a naive filmmaker, ever suspected. The town's side-winding mayor, the "Honorable" Bursed Byner, is determined to keep him from telling the truth about his shady dealings. With his talking puppet at his side, Byner launches one scheme after another to derail DW's hope of filmmaking fame. Still, within the crazy assortment of Swampwater citizenry, DW finds a glimmer of hope, as well as the cash, to keep his film project going. He winds up filming increasingly bizarre commercials for town folk like a deadly, silent auto mechanic or a tour boat captain who gets his navigation from a bottle of schnapps. In his struggle to achieve his dream, he learns that award-winning filmmaking does not always come from arresting images but, usually results in an arrest record. 'A Swamp With a View' is a funny, insider's view of the world of Swampwater, Florida and, whether you wanted it or not, shows you what a difference sea level makes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016770</url></doc>
