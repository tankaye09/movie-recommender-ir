<plot>Winston has chronic asthma. His asthma prevents him from participating in everyday activities such as gym and recess. In order to cope, he spends most of his time indoors drawing and discovers a fantasy world where his medical burdens become his method of flight. One day it rains, and like Winson, all his classmates become trapped inside. Winston charms and dazzles his peers and lets them all in on his special talent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049147</url></doc>
