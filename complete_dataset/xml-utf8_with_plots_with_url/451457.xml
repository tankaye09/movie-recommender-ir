<plot>This documentary includes historical musical performances re-assessed by a panel of esteemed experts, as well as obscure footage, rare interviews and rarely seen photographs. It also contains review, comment, criticism and insight from; Broadcaster and friend of Freddie, Paul Gambaccini; Night club owner [where Freddie often hung-out], Peter Stringfellow; Close friend, Wayne Sleep; Rock Journalists, Malcolm Dome, Mick Wall, Jerry Ewing and John Robb; DJ Paul Burnett; and Freddie Mercury tribute artists, Steve Littlewood and Joseph Lee Jackson. In addition, live and studio recordings of Mercury's finest moments have been added, as well as footage of and comment on his pivotal musical influences. He's been called the finest performer of the 20th Century, the best showman of all time and Mr. Entertainment himself - but these descriptions only go part of the way in representing the extraordinary talents of Freddie Mercury. How about, unique songwriter? gifted bandleader? superb vocalist? smart and canny businessman? Freddie was all these and more and in this documentary film his genius is put under the spotlight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?451457</url></doc>
