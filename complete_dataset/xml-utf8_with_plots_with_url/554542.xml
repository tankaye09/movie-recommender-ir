<plot>In Derek Eastham's, "The Duel," the relationship between gunmen in a classic western duel is explored and emotionalized. Rather than the both of them having their gunfight out in a matter of moments, Derek uses the images to convey the emotions &amp; thoughts that run through these cowboys minds in the moments leading up to that last moment when they fire their guns. This film is an emotional story of good v evil and all of the emotions that fly between them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554542</url></doc>
