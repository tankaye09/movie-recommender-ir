<plot>This picture was taken from the Canadian shore, the camera revolving from left to right, making a two-thirds circle and giving a detailed view of the new steel suspension bridge, which reaches from the rocks of old Fort Gray on the American cliff, to the Canadian shore below the falls, and continuing on until the City of Niagara, the American Falls and Cave o fthe Winds, Goat Island and the Horseshoe Falls are brought into view in succession. A most complete view of Niagara Falls and its wonderful surroundings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106944</url></doc>
