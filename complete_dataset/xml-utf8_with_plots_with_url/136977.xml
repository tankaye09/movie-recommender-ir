<plot>A short film which centres around a Dentist (Paul) his wife (Kate) and the Dentist's old school friend (Jack). Paul and Jack never really got on, they used to just tollerate each other. Jack's a womanising estate agent who doesn't have much time for other people, Paul's an upstanding Dentist with a lovely wife; but just how much does Paul know? "Dentally Does It" is a black comedy with a twist in the tail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?136977</url></doc>
