<plot>What if 30 days of fast food could lead to healthy weight loss? Sound impossible? It didn't to Julie Dove. Julie struggled with weight her entire life. As an actor in Hollywood, she felt even more pressure to maintain a certain body image. She ate a lot cheap fast food and blamed that for her weight gain. But Julie learned that people-not companies-are responsible for America's obesity epidemic, no matter their socio-economic status or where they get their food. So, under a medically supervised weight-loss plan, Julie ate McDonald's exclusively for 30 Days. Through her story and interviews with others who have struggled, My McDiet is an inspiration for anyone who has battled with their weight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384436</url></doc>
