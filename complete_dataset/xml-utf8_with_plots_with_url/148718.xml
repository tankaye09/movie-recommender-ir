<plot>The Emperor of China hears a nightingale sing, and decides to capture her, yet he fails. So he tries at least to have her call imitated, yet there everybody at his court fails, so he offers a prize for success in this - the marriage with his daughter. Two Europeans hear of it - a Mr. Tri-Ergon (record label) and a Mr. Trichter (recording horn). Both try with their recording devices to cut a record of the Nightingale.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?148718</url></doc>
