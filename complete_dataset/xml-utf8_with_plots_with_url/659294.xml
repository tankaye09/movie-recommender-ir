<plot>In this intimate family portrait, the lead searches for her family history, only to encounter roadblocks and closed lips on her journey. Determined to understand why her family shuns her questions, and treats her inquires about the family history in California as a sin. Layer by layer, the lead pulls back the history of her family and discovers unknown aspects of California history that help her better understand her family, and leads her back into the family, which is also transformed as they come to more fully understand as a group how California's early policies towards Native Americans impacted the family for generations to come.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659294</url></doc>
