<plot>Los Angeles is a Mecca for cars. The city is build around a 930 mile-long freeway system, that is used every year by more than seven million cars. The L.A. freeway system just keeps growing and growing, and director Jacob Thuesen attempts to capture the rhythm of the expanding freeway system. As in his prize-winning portrait of the New York subway system, "Under New York" (1996), Thuesen is using curiosity and wonder as a driving force, following the many people, who drive the freeway and those who in vain try to control it. The result is a film filled with small absurd situations, and whose fragments at the end form a larger pattern.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203532</url></doc>
