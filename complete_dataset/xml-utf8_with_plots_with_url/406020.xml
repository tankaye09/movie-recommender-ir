<plot>Mounties O'Mally and Calhoun are sent to see why miners are not returning with their gold. Arriving, they recover the gold from a robbery attempt. O'Mally who was not seen decides to put away his uniform to let the outlaws think Calhoun is the only Mountie. Just as Sassoon's men who are after the gold capture him, Calhoun arrives and he confesses to the murder of the miner to escape them. He then has Calhoun tell Sassoon where the gold is planning to trap him but Sassoon's men knock out Calhoun before he can release O'Mally from his jail cell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406020</url></doc>
