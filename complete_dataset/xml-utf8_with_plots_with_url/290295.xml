<plot>A culinary piece of cinema. This humourous critique of dehumanisation in big-city life depicts a depressed urban dweller who leaves for the countryside, where he tries to sell a piece of land he had inherited. He is charmed by the idyllic life, but has to keep up with the voracious appetites of his hosts, who literally never stop eating, even waking up to snack. He soon adapts to their eating habits, but only after he is taken to the hospital, suffering severe indigestion due to his hosts' generosity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290295</url></doc>
