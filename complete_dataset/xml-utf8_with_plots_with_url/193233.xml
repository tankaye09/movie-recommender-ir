<plot>Two happy L.A. couples. A baby on the way. A cozy, stay-at-home Saturday night. A perfectly lovely evening, right? Wrong. 'Cause Cousin Jolene has unexpectedly hit town. Cousin Jolene...dear, sweet, trash-talkin' Texan Cousin Jolene, whose exes have all done her wrong, leaving the ticking of her biological clock a deafening roar.
