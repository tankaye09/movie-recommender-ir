<plot>In 1958, after being called in front of the House Unamerican Activities Committee, Milton Rogovin, a Buffalo optometrist, took up documentary photography. In 1972-73, he took pictures of people from Buffalo's Lower West Side, people he calls "the forgotten ones." The photographs were his first one-man gallery show. In 1984-85, 1992, and 2001, he and his wife Emma returned to the Lower West Side and photographed the same people: couples, families, dads with children, and friends. In 2003, when Milton is 93, a film crew follows them on a walk through the neighborhood. People greet the aging couple with great affection. They bring out his books. He talks about his accomplishment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370306</url></doc>
