<plot>Runaway wealthy heiress, Raksha, joins a traveller, Madan, in a small truck, heading toward the home of his uncle, Manoharlal. When they reach their destination, they are informed that Manoharlal has passed away, and the estate and all the wealth is taken over by his son, Kuldeep, and his mother. Madan is suspicious and starts making inquiries about this death. Soon he himself comes under suspicion, and with the help of Surjit, he is arrested and imprisoned by the police, on the charge of kidnapping Raksha. This gets him out of the way, so that the real culprits can get away with the wealth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391122</url></doc>
