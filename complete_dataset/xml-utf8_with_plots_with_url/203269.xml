<plot>Free Lisl - Fear &amp; Loathing in Denver explores the most significant achievement of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson's last years - the freeing of Lisl Auman who was sentenced to life without parole at the age of 21 for the murder of a Denver police officer by someone she had just met while she was handcuffed in the back of a police car. After receiving a letter from Lisl while she was in prison in 2001, Thompson enlisted the support of the nation's top criminal defense lawyers, held a rally on the steps of the Colorado State Capitol and co-wrote an article for Vanity Fair subtitled "Lynching in Denver" - all in an attempt to free Lisl from a life sentence in prison. In March 2005, two weeks after Thompson committed suicide, the Colorado Supreme Court effectively set her free by reversing her conviction and ordering a retrial. A plea bargain leaves her on probation for many years to come, but Lisl is out of prison and appears for the first time in Free Lisl, not to argue her case, but to thank Hunter Thompson.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203269</url></doc>
