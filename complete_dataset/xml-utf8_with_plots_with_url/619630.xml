<plot>Truk Lagoon is a sheltered body of water almost fifty miles long by thirty miles wide surrounded by a protective reef northeast of Australia. Truk Lagoon was the Pearl Harbour for Japan. Once the American forces captured the Marshall Islands, they used it as a base from which they launched an early morning attack on February 17th,1944. Sixty ships were sent to the bottom of the Lagoon. This documentary takes you back to that day and shows that, years later the Japanese were allowed to finally bury their dead. Stunning underwater footage of the wrecks and a search for the only ship that was never found is part of this great documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619630</url></doc>
