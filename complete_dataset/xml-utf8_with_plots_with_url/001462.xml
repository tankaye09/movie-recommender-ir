<plot>This hit show (in both senses of the term) was for years Flanders' weekly equivalent of the BBC's Top of the Pops, but on commercial TV (VTM). Over time presenters came and went, and some minor features too, such as voting in a relatively unknown, but basically it has always been a parade of Flemish and some international, slightly more English - then Dutch -, occasionally other language hit songs performed live, indoors (often in a major disco) or outdoors; later it was removed from the weekly schedule, but tends to reoccur in summer, on location at the Belgian coast.</plot><plot>This hit show (in both senses of the term) was for years Flanders' weekly equivalent of the BBC's Top of the Pops, but on commercial TV (VTM).
