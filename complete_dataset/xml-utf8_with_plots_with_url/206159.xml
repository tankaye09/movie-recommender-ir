<plot>A 6-episode, Hi-Def mini-series focusing on the human challenges involved in constructing, testing, preparing, and running a brand new sports-car for the prestigious "Daytona 24," a grueling 24-hour car race at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. This high-speed drama focuses on the key members of TRG ("The Racer's Group"), a well known sports-car team challenged with the task of debuting Pontiac's race version of the GTO. Specifically, the series follows team owner Kevin Buckler, lead driver Andy Lally, Team Manager Bill Rader, as well as several other supporting characters from the 2006 Daytona 24. This series has been highly regarded for its honest portrayal of the human challenge for this sort of event, as well as telling the entire story through the eyes of the characters, not a narrator.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206159</url></doc>
