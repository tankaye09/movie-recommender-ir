<plot>"This is one of the most famous regiments in the United States service. It was in the first line of the charge at San Juan Hill; served with distinction throughout the hardest fighting in the Philippines, and was the first regiment to be ordered to China, and in the fighting there, was in the thick of it [the Boxer Rebellion].
