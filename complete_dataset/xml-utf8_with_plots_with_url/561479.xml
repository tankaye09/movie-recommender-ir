<plot>Filled with fast-paced action and drama, The Goldfish weaves together two stories. In the first, Martin Glaser rises early one morning only to find his wife's precious fish dead. He's determined to find a replacement before she wakes. Returning home with a replacement proves to be an unexpectedly complicated odyssey. The pet store just sold their last goldfish, and Martin is forced to steal the fish from a local kid. The second story follows Duncan, who, in a final desperate act, disguises himself as Abe Lincoln and sets out to rob a local pastry shop. Instead of a clean getaway, Duncan unwittingly finds his true calling. As the new shopkeeper, he handles difficult customers and complicated cake orders with the ease of a master pastry chef. The separate stories collide when Martin pulls into the store to replace the rapidly leaking bag containing his new goldfish. The pastry shop is held up a second time and the fish is once again placed in jeopardy. The Goldfish is about the struggle to maintain control in a violent, chaotic and, at times, humorous world -- the extremes to which we'll go to make things right, no matter how wrong they may turn out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?561479</url></doc>
