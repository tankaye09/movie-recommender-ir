<plot>The Quiet War was created to be a source of information and an extensive resource for women facing Advanced Breast Cancer, i.e. cancer that has spread beyond the breast. The film was also created to increase awareness and sensitivity for these women by their caregivers and medical professionals. The content of this film was shaped by cancer survivors and has been reviewed by medical professionals. It is meant to be a guide for women, not an exclusive resource.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585034</url></doc>
