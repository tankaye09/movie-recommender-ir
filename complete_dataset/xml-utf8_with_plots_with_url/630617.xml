<plot>Unexpected Happenings is about new beginnings, the excitement of living on your own for the first time away from your family... and the moment you realize that now you are on your own. Holly &amp; Tressa move into an empty flat in Rushcutters Bay. At first, the flat seems like a dream come true, with a beautiful view of Sydney Harbour, cheap rent, lots of room and every students dream - it comes fully furnished! But Holly starts to hear things in the middle of the night... Taps are left on, strange noises can be heard, someone is whistling Swan Lake from the bathroom... Someone or something is going bump in the night. Would you get out of bed to find out what's going on or would you pull the covers over your head and pray for morning? And what does all of these "unexpected happenings" have to do with the music box Holly found on the window sill?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?630617</url></doc>
