<plot>A man in limbo has nothing but time to figure out why he ended up there. While he is confined to the room he ended his life in, he is reminded through shadows that the decisions he made may have left him out of God's good graces even if some of those decisions were made for him. He tries to shun his memories by blocking out the light coming through the window, but even the softest candle can cast a shadow. Through reflection he feels as he did on the last day of his life; not depressed but bored. All the tools and props were there for him to lead a normal existence but they were of no interest to him. So, like a man bored and frustrated with his job, he quit. But the past is stubborn and there is no changing it. For should he own this same mindset tomorrow then he will never see what's on the other side of that window.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266798</url></doc>
