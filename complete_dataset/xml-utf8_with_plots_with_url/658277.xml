<plot>Twelve year old Jamie discovers a surefire method for picking a winning horse at the races by developing an advanced computer program. Trouble is he's too young to put a bet on. Lucky then his eccentric Gran is willing to get involved. Soon the whole town develops gambling fever. As his winning streak continues Jamie and sister Lucy are delighted but they soon realize that things aren't that simple. They're assigned an ultra strict nanny and their names are put down for a boarding school miles from home. Maybe it would be best not to win.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658277</url></doc>
