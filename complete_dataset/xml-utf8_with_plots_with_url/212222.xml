<plot>This film is about artist Genko Genkov, an extremely gifted and very unusual personality. Letting the camera in on his life, he makes us witnesses to his continuous resistance against the power that be. We are shown the lunatic asylum - a redemption nightmare for the nonconformists - where Genko managed to find the strength to paint and to produce a number of works. Having preserved his indestructible vitality and modernist authenticity, Genko also acquaints us with his closest friends and with his personal enemies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212222</url></doc>
