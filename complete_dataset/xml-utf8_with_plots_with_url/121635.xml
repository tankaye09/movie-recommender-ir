<plot>On a stage at San Francisco's Sutro Baths, in front of what looks like a large crowd, a young woman portraying Psyche and a girl of about ten portraying Cupid perform a simple dance. Psyche wears a white dress with petticoats and dons a white-feathered hat. Cupid is in a white leotard with wings on her back. The dance itself is rhythmic and without drama or much interaction between the characters - more of a prancing about.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121635</url></doc>
