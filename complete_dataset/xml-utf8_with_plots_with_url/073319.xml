<plot>Chuck is a petty thief, always on the quest of quick money to fulfill his ill-gotten needs. Amanda, blind by birth, is a schoolteacher, who lives alone, in a small apartment in the suburbs of New York. While scouting around the neighborhood, Chuck manages to break into Amanda's apartment. Taken by Amanda's surprise return, Chuck hides himself in a closet but in his haste he leaves behind a series of clues indicative of his presence in the house. Amanda's realization of someone in the house and her determination to fight back is what drives the story beyond.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073319</url></doc>
