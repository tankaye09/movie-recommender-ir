<plot>After leaving Yugoslavia in 1992 with her mother and sister, Iva would have to continue the rest of her life in foreign lands. As time passed, communication with her father became less frequent and more distant, as if overnight her parents were no longer together; a fact nobody remembered to mention. Not having returned for over 11 years, charged with nostalgia and a yearning for homemade burek, Iva makes her way 'home.' Returning, she discovers her father's long-kept secret - an 11-year-old brother. The story is revealed through a gossipy and emotional exchange with her old next-door neighbor.</plot><plot>After leaving Yugoslavia in 1992 with her mother and sister, Iva would have to continue the rest of her life in foreign lands.
