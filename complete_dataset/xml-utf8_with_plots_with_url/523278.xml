<plot>SURPRISE INSPECTION - Rats. Roaches. Rotten food. Irate owners. It's all in a day's work for the army of public health inspectors, who spend each day keeping the nation's food supply safe from contamination and disease. truTV's cameras will follow inspectors in Providence, R.I., as they shine their flashlights into the darkest corners of some of the city's dirtiest places, including restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, gas stations, stadium concession stands, public swimming pools and health clubs. This show will be a compelling, fast-paced glimpse into the world of those who do their best to keep public places clean and safe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523278</url></doc>
