<plot>Oliver and his family visit a photography exhibit at a museum in Berlin. While looking at one of the photographs, Oliver hears the narrator's voice from the Audio-Tour's headset interrupted by that of a young woman - apparently the girl in the photograph. She says she's been waiting for him. Oliver moves closer and closer to the photo until he finds himself inside the picture, face to face with the beautiful and enigmatic girl. She takes him by the hand and the two spend an evening together in Berlin. The following morning, the two part ways and Oliver soon after finds himself back in the museum, no time having passed. He continues to stare at the picture of the girl, confused by his fragmented reality, still hearing the words, "I'm waiting" echoing in his head.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255951</url></doc>
