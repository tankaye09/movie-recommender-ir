<plot>Documentary film version of the stage show in which actress 'Cynthia Gates Fujikawa' (qv) explores the story of her father, actor 'Jerry Fujikawa' (qv), who had a long career in films and television, most often as a stereotyped Asian. The daughter, in the course of searching out her late father's history, discovers many things that she had not known, among them that her father had spent time in Manzanar, the internment camp for Japanese-Americans during World War II, that he had had a family prior to hers, and that somewhere out there was a sister she had never known existed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409479</url></doc>
