<plot>The police are baffled by a case of kidnapping and murder, and they have no clues to go on. A reporter is convinced that the crime was committed by the notorious criminal Sawed-Off Madison. The reporter asks his roommate, an office boy at his newspaper, to confess to the crime, in order to throw off the police so that the reporter can capture the criminal himself. The office boy agrees to the plan, but things do not work out as they two of them had hoped.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272840</url></doc>
