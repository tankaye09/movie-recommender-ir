<plot>A music student, Lila, whose uncle has stolen the family fortune - agrees to play the piano for a cranky spinster, Miss Aristea, in a bid to make the latter's canaries sing. As time goes by, Aristea recalls her own youth and feels protective towards Lila. She assigns her lawyer to reclaim the girl's fortune from her embezzling uncle. However, during a visit by Lila's friends, her fianc√© Paris is startled by a picture of his father, who, as it turns out, was Aristea's one true love. The unexpected emotion, however, doesn't help the unfortunate woman find peace and happiness; in fact, the shock kills her. In her will, it turns out that she has left Lila her 201 canaries, but in an old worn-out couch a significant sum of money is discovered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?527898</url></doc>
