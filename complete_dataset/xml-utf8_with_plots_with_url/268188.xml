Following a few negative remarks on her part about his work Tancredi is driven to question himself artistically. Now, Judy has to leave but she promises to see Tancredi again, which they do. Their mutual attraction soon turns into a burning passion. As Judy will soon benefit from a week off they promise each other to live this blessed period to the full.
