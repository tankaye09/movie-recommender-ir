<plot>Emily is lost. She is forgetting who are where she is, and yet seems utterly unconcerned. A strange but familiar figure appears who prompts Emily to remember her past and, reluctantly, she does so. As she struggles emotionally with her resurfacing memories, the danger of her situation becomes suddenly clear. The storm that has been chasing them is cancer, she is comatose and the world that she now inhabits its the last battleground, her mind. Her companions identity also becomes clear, she, a different form of cancer (that of the mind), represents her dead mother whose past suicide has caused Emily to lose all hope of fighting this hereditary disease. In Emily's final moments she is given a choice which fundamentally deals with the matter of life and death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127139</url></doc>
