<plot>This is a trick picture of a very amusing character. As the scene opens there is shown an elaborate easel and table. The wizard enters and rapidly sketches a woman's head, which at once comes to life. He at one removes the head and places it on the table. He then proceeds to draw an armless bust which similarly comes to life and is placed under the head. Two living arms are next produced in the same way and attached to the bust. The skirt is similarly added and the lady as a whole steps forward. The wizard gives her a seat and then proceeds to rapidly sketch a baby in long clothes which comes to life and is taken from the frame squirming and kicking and carried rapidly toward a camera giving a most ludicrous effect. Picture is quite perfect in its way, and is an excellent comedy throughout.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248599</url></doc>
