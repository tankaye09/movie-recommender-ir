<plot>Sam, a man, and Piccolo, a creature, live together in an isolated valley. The two friends lead simple, uneventful lives but are content. After eating a unique nut that Piccolo discovers growing on a small tree, he wonders: Why aren't there more nuts? He wants more. Piccolo learns that watering the tree produces more nuts, but as the nuts grow, so do his cravings. In time he discovers that things other than water will make the tree grow - and much more spectacularly. But, as the tree grows stronger, everything else in the valley is diminishing. What has Piccolo got himself into? Will he see what is at stake? Or will he be too late?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475238</url></doc>
