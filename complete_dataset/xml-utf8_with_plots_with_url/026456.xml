<plot>Ahingsa (Boriwat Yuto) is a petty thug who lives a carefree life with his friends in the high-tech world of modern Thailand. Mysteriously, an anonymous guy always dressed in red (Teeradanai Suwanahom) begins to appear everywhere and is chasing him everywhere to mess in his life. He doesn't really know who this weird guy is or what he wants from him. Though it seems unbelievable for Ahingsa, this guy is known as his "fate." Ahingsa tries to defeat him, but fails every time. He tries to avoid "fate" while at the same time falling in love with a beautiful local girl. He soon realizes he has to confront his mysterious rival in order to take his life back and regain control over his own fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026456</url></doc>
