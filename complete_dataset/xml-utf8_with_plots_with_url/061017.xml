<plot>An exploration of the issue of domestic violence and what is being done to try and combat the problem. 'Michael Portillo (II)' (qv) meets people affected by domestic violence (including _"X Factor, The" (2004)_ (qv) finalist 'Rowetta Satchell' (qv)), examines the support services designed to help victims, looks at the question of whether abusers can change their behavior, and follows the South Wales Police to see the effect it has on their time, resources and the difficulty of prosecution. Portillo also visits a primary school to see what measures are being taken to tackle children's attitudes to violence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061017</url></doc>
