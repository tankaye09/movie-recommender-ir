<plot>This is one of the most surprising and clever subjects of the entire series. The conjurer causes to appear suddenly on the table a box, from which a boy emerges. He is immediately cut into two pieces at a blow from the axe of the conjurer. Instead of falling to the floor, the pieces assume the shape of two lively youngsters, who commence to fight with each other. The conjurer, not approving of such conduct, causes one suddenly to disappear. The other boy, whom he takes up in his arms, he dissolves into an English and an American flag, which are vigorously waved by the magician. A most interesting film, sharp and clear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260074</url></doc>
