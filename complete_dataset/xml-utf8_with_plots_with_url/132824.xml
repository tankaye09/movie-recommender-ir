<plot>Dead Conversation. What happens when a man finds himself in conflict? Is he calm, is he agitated? Does he ignore the situation or does he try to sort out the problem that faces him? What if the problem is not all together clear? and what if he has no one to ask the solution of but himself? We've all been put in frustrating situations where we've felt as though we're banging our heads against a brick wall. An unshakable foe refusing to cooperate. As annoying as this can be, if we choose, we can always walk away. The star of this film however doesn't have that luxury.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?132824</url></doc>
