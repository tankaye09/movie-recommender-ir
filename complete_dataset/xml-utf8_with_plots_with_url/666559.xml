<plot>A small boy is carried off to bed by the butler at the command of his mother, a dashing widow, who is expecting a call from a suitor. The small boy sneaks back in and hides behind the screen. He then skilfully connects a thread to his mother's wig and passes it over the chandelier. The suitor comes in and is soon on his knees "popping the question." Just as he does so, however, the small boy pulls the thread, the wig flies off, and the youngster's revenge is complete. Excellent comedy throughout.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666559</url></doc>
