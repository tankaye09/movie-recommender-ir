<plot>This is a ford which is used by natives to avoid paying toll on the English Bridge. Across the ford pass some of the most picturesque caravans to be seen anywhere in the world and this film shows the ford at one of its busiest hours. The water is full of all sorts of queer vehicles, with Coolies bearing masses of fagots on their heads, veiled women riding on their donkeys, etc. Altogether the scene is brim full of local color and is as picturesque as the most fastidious operator can wish for. It is, without doubt a "hit" picture and has received our unqualified approval.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049698</url></doc>
