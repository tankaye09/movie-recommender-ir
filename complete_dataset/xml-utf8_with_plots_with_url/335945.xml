<plot>Dora Allen is a strong minded twenty-something woman with the unique ability to speak to people and provide them with helpful advice for their problems. She gives off an aura that invites even complete strangers, to confide in her with their deepest secrets and problems. Dora always comes through with thoughtful advice. What she does not realize is, most people become addicted to her help. What the people in Dora's life don't realize is, sometimes with free advice, you get what you pay for. To make matters worse, Dora's personal life is in shambles. From a sister she never speaks to, to a mother she can't stand, a crazy best friend, and a boyfriend who may or may not actually be a boyfriend. Dora is anything but together. Fed up with the backlash from people who aren't satisfied when things don't work out exactly the way they hoped, Dora swears off helping people altogether, only to be confronted with a life or death situation where she must decide whether she will continue to give advice or not.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335945</url></doc>
