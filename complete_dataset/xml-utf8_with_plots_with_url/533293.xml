When the sons grow up, they marry a Sindhi, Maratha, Bengali, and Gujerati girls, while the fifth one, Suresh, is unmarried. Suresh is attracted to the melodious voice of a radio singer by the name of Kokila, and has drawn the portrait of a beautiful woman who matches her voice in every respect and manner.
