<plot>While on a holiday trip in Northern India, Dr. Tariq meets with a lovely native girl named Chanvi, and both fall in love with each other, and get intimate. Tariq has to leave for London, U.K. to obtain his medical degree, and boards a plane. Unfortunately, the plane crashes, without any survivors. This news devastates Chanvi. Her situation does not get any better when she finds out that she is pregnant. She gives birth to a baby girl, and sets out to start a new life, and ends up in the hands of a cruel and self-serving individual named Sagar, who marries her, but abandons the child at a brothel. Sagar develops health problems and is hospitalized. In order to save him, the medical staff must operate on him. And the doctor assigned to this task is none other than Dr. Tariq. When Chanvi finds out she seeks the help of the police to save Sagar, as she feels that Tariq will kill Sagar - as he believes she has been unfaithful to him. Will the police intervene in time to save Sagar?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641673</url></doc>
