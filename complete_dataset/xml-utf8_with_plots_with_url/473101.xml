<plot>Raj Kumar has been married to his wife for several years. He comes from a middle-class family, while his wife comes from a wealthy family. He has struggled all his married life to provide all the comforts and conveniences to please his wife. The end result is that he does not have enough time to spend with her, and she is displeased. Raj has found a sympathizer in Hansa Paranjpe, who is married and living with a womanizing husband. Together these two have an affair. When a murder is committed, Raj is subpoened to appear in court and testify as to his whereabouts. Raj knows that if he testifies truthfully, their affair will come to light, and Hansa's name will be stigmatized forever.
