<plot>Described by "Radio Times" as "a kaleidoscope from the world of books," this Sunday afternoon BBC series featured book reviews, interviews and dramatized excerpts, scripted by Dennis Potter, from both contemporary books and classics. Although Potter's title was Script Associate, he provided "ideas" and script outlines and wrote the finished scripts. Potter also conducted interviews with Francis Chichester, Edward Hyams, James Morris and Francis Newton. His drama sequences included Henry James' "The Turn of the Screw," Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," Dashiell Hammett's "The Glass Key," Iris Murdoch's "Under the Net," Kingsley Amis' "That Uncertain Feeling," Stan Barstow's "A Kind of Loving" and Colin MacInnes' "Absolute Beginners."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079302</url></doc>
