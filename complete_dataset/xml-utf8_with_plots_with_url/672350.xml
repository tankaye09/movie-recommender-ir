<plot>Two orphaned brothers (ages 17 and 7) go to live with their grandfather. He is occupied with his business and his grief, and is distant and critical (especially of the older brother). Whenever the younger brother gets into trouble, the older brother is blamed. Only an uncle can see that the family is in trouble.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?672350</url></doc>
