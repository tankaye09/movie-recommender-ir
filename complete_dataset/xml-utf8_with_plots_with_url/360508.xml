<plot>Walter Lassally, master cinematographer of 100 famous movies, including Zorba the Greek, for which he won an Oscar, meets W. Lambert Scot Gardiner, a university professor of communications and psychology. They have a conversation that becomes a master class in their respective fields while lunching in a seaside cafe in Greece. They let us into their trade secrets, but also reveal aspects of their personalities and their passion for cinema and for life. The cinematic experience they provide is like a private and privileged visit with two highly accomplished professionals in their golden years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360508</url></doc>
