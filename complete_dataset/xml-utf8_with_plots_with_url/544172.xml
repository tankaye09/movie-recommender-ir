<plot>A young man is followed in his process of becoming a woman through a transsexual operation in Iran, up to and beyond his operation. We meet his boyfriend, other transsexuals (among them, a woman becoming a man), the doctors, a priest and especially his family. All of them are religious, all of them are changing lives, but why would a 'free' man choose to become a woman and lead a veiled life from now on? A portrait of schizophrenic lives in a schizophrenic environment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544172</url></doc>
