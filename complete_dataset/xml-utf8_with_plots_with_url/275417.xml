<plot>Spirits summoned the auras of their creations to ceremony and to prayer, imprisoning some pilgrims whose intentions were self-centered. Has the quest has gone haywire, or is there a method in this madness? Souls of a dolphin, a whale, and a penguin, trapped in rock, watch as astral projections of eels, palm trees, and jellyfish frolic ecstatically through the mountainous desert. The new pilgrims intrude, unaware that they drain the captives' energy. The captives dream of freedom and pray silently for a miracle. A jellyfish attains enlightenment. How will the captives' prayers be answered?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275417</url></doc>
