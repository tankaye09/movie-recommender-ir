<plot>Sitadevi lives a comfortable life with her husband and two sons, Rakesh and Rajesh. While celebrating the birth of one of her son's, her husband gets killed in an automobile accident, and his friends, Dhartiraj and Malpani capriciously take over his estate and ask Sitadevi and her sons to leave. While leaving by train, Sitadevi and Rakesh are separated from Rajesh during an accident. Years later, Rakesh grows up to be a singer, while Rajesh lives a life of crime, and is the hit-man of none other than Dhartiraj. When Dhartiraj's only daughter, Jyoti, falls in love with Rakesh, Dhartiraj arranges to meet with him, and tentatively agrees to this marriage. Rakesh does not know that Dhartiraj has already finalized Jyoti's marriage with Malpani's son, and has made arrangements for Rakesh to be killed by none other than Rajesh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246045</url></doc>
