<plot>This is not a report on war, but an exploration of what happened to Afghanistan, the nation we heard and read so much about following the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in New York 2001. Was any of it true? Completely unprepared Pål Hollender and his friend-with-a-death-wish, Swedish pop star Olle Ljungström, went to Afghanistan, wrecklessly diving into the tension building up in September 2002, the anniversary of 9/11 approaching. In "United States of Afghanistan" we witness Olle's hopeless efforts to perform in the street with his songs. There is unique footage of an explosion and the exhilarated media trying to cover the scene before it turns cold. And we meet little Ali, a nine-year-old Afghan boy. Through his uncensored eyes we get to see the events and situation following the American invasion of Afghanistan. The result is a series of visually strong and intimate scenes from Afghanistan. The disturbing ignorance of the two friends from Sweden is as relevant as the meeting with the Afghan people and their culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?630982</url></doc>
