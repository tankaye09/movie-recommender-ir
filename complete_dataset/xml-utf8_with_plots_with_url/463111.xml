<plot>In 1988 Cole Beacham saw his best friend killed for nothing more than local glory. Fifteen years later he returns to share his childhood with his young son. Facing painful memories, Cole comes face to face with the irrational justification that killed Jason years before. Now forced to make the ride to protect his family, he must also survive the road, the river that took his friend, and in his rage find compassion for the man he should kill. Cole must ride to live.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?463111</url></doc>
