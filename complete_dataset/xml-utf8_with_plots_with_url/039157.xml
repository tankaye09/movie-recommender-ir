<plot>A forest warden and his strange companion are faced with a question: two girls don't just tear each other apart, do they? It looks like two girls just did. And the warden already has the photographs to prove it. So he says: the girls walked out into the forest to meet a stranger from the internet. A dam was their only point of reference in the alien natural world. But out there in the wilderness, technology has found its way to influence the course of events. Like the great artificial dam that alters the flow of water, an invisible camera captured the violent future that neither of the girls could understand or control. Victims of their own terror, they were caught up in an unspoken rage where human contact overwhelms and rips the other apart. And the companion responds by showing him the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039157</url></doc>
