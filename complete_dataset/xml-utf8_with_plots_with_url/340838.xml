<plot>When Abby, a journalist for a major newspaper who is consumed with her job, loses both of her parents in a car accident, her boss sends her on vacation to his lake house in a small town called Cave Spring. Thinking this will just be a short break from her everyday life, Abby meets Austin, a kind-hearted and humble owner of a local bookstore. While she is falling for him, Abby also begins to fall in love with a series of books by a mysterious yet classic author named August Winters, who apparently disappeared about ten years ago. But as her vacation slowly comes to an end, Abby must decide if she is willing to leave her everything behind for the people she cares about, or if she will ultimately return to the same monotonous existence that has become her life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340838</url></doc>
