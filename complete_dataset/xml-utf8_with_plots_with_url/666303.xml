<plot>"Project 131" follows three returning cast members, Vanessa Lindores, Marjorie Silcoff and Brodie Osome, as they fulfill the wishes of producers and produce one final episode before finally being let go. The show was still being produced, yet it was so bad that no network would air it. Ross has retired, leaving the "kids" to direct themselves. Barth opened a fine dining establishment and left it for Brodie to manage, while he returned to his diner...yet food is still served from unknown sources. The library was to be torn down to make way for a new mini-mall, but while cleaning up the place in hopes of preventing demolition, Brodie gets slimed and Marjorie gets watered. Les Lye's grandson, Josh Dunn, begins his announcing career -- only to have it end as a result of the series finale. The three hosts leave the studio one last time, and Vanessa turns out the lights, while cast members Alasdair Gillis and Justin Cammy are upset that they weren't included in the new episode...even though they were.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666303</url></doc>
