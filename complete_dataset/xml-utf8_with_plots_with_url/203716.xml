<plot>"A tremendously impressive picture. At its opening a battery of six field guns is seen in action, the gun squads loading and firing with precision. In the distance a regiment of cuirassieurs is charging at full speed upon the battery. The artillerists continue to fire until the horsemen are fairly upon them, when they suddenly dodge beneath the guns and fire at their opponents with their small arms, the cavalry in the meantime, cutting and slashing wherever they see a head. Although this picture was not taken in actual combat, it has all the elements of realism in it."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203716</url></doc>
