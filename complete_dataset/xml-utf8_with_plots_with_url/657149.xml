<plot>"Wilderness Plots: Songs and Stories of the Prairie" is a television music special that provides a glimpse into the creative collaboration of six Midwestern artists - five musicians and one writer. The program features a selection of their songs based on tales about the settling of America, which were written by Scott Russell Sanders. Complementing the performances are intimate interviews with the artists allowing each to offer insight into their work, their perspectives, and their love for music, writing and history. Ultimately, "Wilderness Plots" is a delightful tribute to the craft of storytelling and songwriting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657149</url></doc>
