<plot>A plane-load of passengers are stranded in distant Gangapur in rural India as their plane is unable to take off due to technical problems. The Airport Manager is S.R. Khan, intoxicated and belligerent at most times, gets to meet his former sweetheart, Gulab Khan, in the company of her husband; his wise-cracking Sikh Assistant, Ram Saran Dubey, whose mother is a Sardarni, while his dad is from Bihar; An estranged father, Sunil Wadhwa, and his wife try to pacify their daughter into accepting their imminent separation; while Italian Siddharth has only a few hours to make up his mind who he wants to marry, Anita Ahuja or Manju Narang, who both happen to be cousins, and both aggressively want to be his wife; The Pilot Captain Vikram Sinha is shattered when he gets the news that his affair with air-hostess, Raj, has resulted in a much avoidable pregnancy; and Internet lovers Farha and Rahul finally meet - only to come to face with reality as Farha's father does not approve of her affair with Rahul, and does not want her to come home. All this happens in the midst of a mysterious male who is asleep on a bench in the Airport Lounge, and he is not to be disturbed under any circumstances. Watch how lives are changed and, decisions are reversed while this group awaits the news of the resumption of their respective journeys.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?298509</url></doc>
