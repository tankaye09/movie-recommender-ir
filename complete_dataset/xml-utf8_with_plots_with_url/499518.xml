<plot>'Moments Moviecaux' is a perversion of the French 'Moments Musicaux' (musical moments) of Schubert and Rachmaninoff. I had the naive wish to bring my paintings and drawings to life. A sort of artistic Victor Frankenstein. I didn't realize I was also bringing them to death. By adding the fourth dimension, time, I gave them mortality. A painting is transcendent in its immortality, but my animations are of this world. By giving the perfect present of the painting a past and a future, I've brought it into our world of birth and death. And so maybe my films are closer to life than art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499518</url></doc>
