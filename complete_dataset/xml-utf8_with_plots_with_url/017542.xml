<plot>This feature length film (shot on black-and-white super-16mm) tells the story of a 74-year-old ex-professor who, after many years of living away from Philadelphia, the city where he came of age, returns to visit his hermit brother who has perfected his freakish steel-trap memory. As a result, however, his apartment has become an unlivable and unsanitary place. He goes out to find some cleaning supplies, only to find himself lost in a city he no longer knows. By shear happenstance, he bumps into an old friend, a wold-class cut-up, who takes him to a place of importance to their past. Schweitzer, there, realizes he must reconcile with the brother he has not spoken to and has refused to understand for most of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017542</url></doc>
