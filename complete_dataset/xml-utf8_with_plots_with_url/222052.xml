<plot>College best-friends Kyle and Ethan are so desperate for money, they find themselves consumed by a get-rich-quick scheme: a research lab is paying out cash for corpse. Enlisting the help of a mysterious get-away driver, they must outsmart the security at the local morgue, deliver the bodies to the questionable contact Mr. Shigo, and avoid being discovered their naive Resident Assistant. Things get even more complicated when the local mob sees the "grave robbing" service as a threat after their own casualties start disappearing. However, Kyle's greatest task might just be telling beautiful Denise that he has feelings for her. Things quickly get out of hand in this quirky comedy written and directed by Matt Francis in his award-winning feature film debut.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222052</url></doc>
