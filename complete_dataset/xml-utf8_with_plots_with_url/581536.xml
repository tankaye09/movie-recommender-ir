<plot>As a bridegroom-to-be is preparing for a bachelor dinner with some friends, one of his friends sends word that he will be unable to attend. For fun, the group decides to invite as a substitute the first man who passes by outside. The first passer-by turns out to be an older man, who reluctantly joins them. He tells them how, at his own bachelor dinner, he suddenly discovered that his fianc√©e had left to marry another man. He goes on to describe how this incident has affected him for the rest of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581536</url></doc>
