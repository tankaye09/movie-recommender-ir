<plot>In which so many transformations take place that it is most bewildering to the onlooker. We first see a man handling a figure of a young girl who suddenly comes to life. He lays her on a board, wraps her up in a large cloth and ties both ends thereof. Taking a large saw, he proceeds to cut the bundle in half, which rolls to the floor in two pieces. They are then in the shape of two cones. Taking up one, he shakes a girl out of it and does likewise with the other one. Retaining the last cone in his hand, he succeeds in producing six additional girls who after displaying themselves, march out of the picture. The man then calls an assitant and instructs him what to do. The assistant takes the heads from off the girls and places them on a board held high over the head of the performer, and who proceeds to hold conversation with the other two heads, after which he restores them to their proper places. The picture is mystical throughout and will not fail to receive great applause.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385453</url></doc>
