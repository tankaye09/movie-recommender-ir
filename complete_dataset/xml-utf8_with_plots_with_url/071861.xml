<plot>"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."- Mother Theresa. It's not easy celebrating your birthday alone; especially in a brothel. M is the most esteemed and highest paid professional of the many girls in the house and, even on her birthday, it's business as usual. M's trade may be sex, but sex doesn't sell the way it used to. Many people come knocking on her bedroom door in the course of one day, and it's not sex they're searching for, paying for; it's love. M's one wish on her 25th birthday is for time to reflect, to reclaim her life, to make other plans and dream other dreams beyond the walls of her bedroom. But it soon becomes clear that she can't escape the workplace conflicts of her colleagues, nor the emotional demands of her clients. Lily, M's apprentice, is struggling to prove her worth in a bid to survive and desperate to avoid a similar fate to co-worker Cindy, for whom the occupational hazards of drug abuse and single motherhood prove too much. The Madame of the House, Scarlet, runs a tight operation, and is also running a campaign for Mayor. Her strict rules and regulations are all that stands between getting paid, or getting kicked out; her birthday aside, M has to get paid. At the very top of M's busy booking schedule for the day is Father Philip, a Catholic Priest who, like M, has lost his way and doubts his faith. For Father Phillip, a regular, the close bond that has developed between himself and M allows, not just for sex, but also counsel. M seems to understand better than anyone the abandonment he feels, and the painful past he cannot escape. Blinded by his own spiritual crisis, Father Philip is oblivious to knowing he just may be the instrument that leads Joey, a 25-year-old boy who has never kissed a girl before, to seek out M's services. Street-wise and world-weary, M can teach Joey a few things, however, there may be more to Joey than meets the eye. It is his birthday too. He too has become accustomed to celebrating alone but, unlike M, who has come to depend only on herself, Joey is on a desperate search for someone to connect with. And he might just be the birthday gift she always wanted. "Birthday" is a story which encompasses lost love, first times, humanity and the discovery of intimacy in surprising and unexpected places. "Birthday" promises to take you on a journey of losing your way, finding hope and the gift that anyone who's ever had a birthday deserves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071861</url></doc>
