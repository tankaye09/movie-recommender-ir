<plot>Three close friends, Pandurang, Kashinath, and Baburao, are employed in the same workplace, and live with their wives, Saraswati, Yamuna, and Ganga respectively. Each has his own faith, while Kashinath is a believer in Vastu Shastra and is always choosing the correct direction, Baburao is a believer in a voodoo-like priest, Baba Ajabnath, and Kashinath is a pious Hindu. All three search for a suitable male for their adopted sister, Anita, but she rejects their respective choices and gets married to Abhijit. Then things get complicated when Kashinath and Baburao get arrested by the Police for embezzling money from their place of employment, and may face time in jail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027744</url></doc>
