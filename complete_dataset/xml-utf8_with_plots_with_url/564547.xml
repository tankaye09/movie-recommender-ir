<plot>Enjoy the game of golf even more with the first and only video documentary to chronicle the growth of one of America's favorite pastimes in Kansas City. From its very beginnings in 1894 to the present day, "The History of Golf in Kansas City" covers the great club makers, teachers, designers, and players from yesterday and today - from James Dalgleish, Harry Robb and Tom Clark, to Leland "Duke" Gibson, Opal Hill, and of course Tom Watson. Hosted by Kansas City Royals baseball broadcaster Fred White.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564547</url></doc>
