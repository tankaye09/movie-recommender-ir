<plot>An ancient prophesy convinces the powerful Master Sorran to commence an obsessive search for Eron, a mythical place capable of giving the Chosen One infinite knowledge. For the sake of his obsession many apprentices die, and Sorran is banished and apparently slain by the leaders of his own Order. Centuries later he reappears, as if having learned to deceive death, and discovers the location of Eron with the help of a young apprentice and the reinvigorated Imperial forces. Master Zui Mar and young Hope, who is overshadowed by a terrible secret, are sent to stop him. However, the Council carefully abstain from revealing all that awaits the two warriors, and the terrible destiny they have foreseen for them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127284</url></doc>
