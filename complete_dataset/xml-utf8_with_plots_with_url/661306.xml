<plot>"The Worthing Station is some distance from the shore, and whenever there is a wreck the life-boat is dragged to the scene on a huge truck drawn by eight horses. Our picture shows the life-boat responding to an alarm. The horses start out from the station at a gallop, and the members of the crew run beside the boat. This negative is unusually fine photographically."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661306</url></doc>
