<plot>Alex Gaylon, an adopted student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, looks for his birth-mother and films the process for his documentary film class. He gets advice from his parents, his film crew, and a fellow adoptee, and finds his birth-mother's information on Google.com. Finally, he attempts to contact his birth mother through the telephone, and what he finds on the other end of the phone line is much more than he ever could have expected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346574</url></doc>
