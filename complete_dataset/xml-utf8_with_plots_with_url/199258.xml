<plot>Dahlonega; 60 miles north of Atlanta; Myra is part Cherokee, a cleaner in the local hotel. She and husband Thomas and unemployed son Terry live in a trailer park. In 1828 gold was found in Dahlonega; The Cherokees were rounded up and force-marched to the west in the 'Trail of Tears.' Today Dahlonega is a rich town living off that history. In a moving portrait, Fool's Gold peels away the layers of affluent colour-co-ordinated shops, cafes and big cars to reveal a community, where people like Myra and Thomas, live out life untouched by the prosperity of tourism, who struggle with poverty but share the little they have with others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199258</url></doc>
