<plot>Luis, a security guard, escapes the city and travels across the desert in search of his wife, Cassandra. He finds her in the care of a makeshift "Family," all of whom seem to be infected by the disease, but none willing to admit it. Cassandra cryptically says she has been waiting for Luis to arrive, but seems to have no memories of him or the past at all. Luis tries to lead Cassandra out of her fugue, but is his own memory as reliable as he thinks?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206329</url></doc>
