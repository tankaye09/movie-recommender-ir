<plot>Star Wars fans, party clowns, scientists, a Rolling Stones tribute band, a private detective, teachers, artists, DJ's, magazine editors, top legal scholars, FBI agents, corporate litigators and many more tell an "extraordinary" tale about how ownership of ideas has come into conflict with free expression. "Willful Infringement", which premiered 2003 at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, has been acclaimed as an entertaining, surprising and sometime shocking report from the front lines of intellectual property. This movie has screened at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the Seattle Art Museum, the Franklin Institute of Science in Philadelphia, at the 17th Leeds International Film Festival, and at numerous universities, law schools and cultural events.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657414</url></doc>
