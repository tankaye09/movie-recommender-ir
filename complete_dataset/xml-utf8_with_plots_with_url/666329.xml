<plot>Because of the war, there aren't enough men at Adams College for all the girls, but Betty (Betty Jane Rhodes as Betty Rhodes) has no difficulties as she has a monopoly on stud-athlete Pete (Bill Edwards). The other girls, particularly Marian (Marjorie Weaver), think this is unfair, so Marian institutes a system of rationing dates. Pete is rated as thirty points and Betty is furious as the other girls bypass the 4-F's and slide-rule geeks to save their ration points to date Pete. Betty drafts him for the Varsity Show, but when the pressure of preparing for the show hurts his studies, Marian volunteers to tutor him and has him all to herself. Scholarly John "Two-Point" Simpson (Johnny Johnston as Johnnie Johnston) auditions and, since he isn't hep to the jive, is laughed off the stage. Betty helps him and soon "Two-Point" is in the groove and makes a hit, and Betty discovers she is in love with him. The faculty cancels the date-rationing plan and Johnnie, whose point value has gone up, thinks Betty is the cause of the ruling and dates Marian for spite. Betty broods and knits booties for her sister's baby, but conveys the impression to Marian that she is to have a baby. Johnnie learns he is the "suspected" father and, thinking it is another of Betty's tricks, plans to leave school. The other girls, led by Bubbles (Marie Wilson), are worried about Betty's future stigma and round up a justice of the peace and Johnnie. Betty confesses the hoax, and the girls start squabbling over the available-again Johnnie, while Betty and Johnnie make use of the still-available Justice of the Peace.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666329</url></doc>
