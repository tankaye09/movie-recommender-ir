<plot>When the Japanese government decides to privatise its armed forces, few people are actually interested in such a risky venture... except the entertainment industry. Media corporations and talent agencies fuse the concepts of pop idols and crack soldiers. In the new air force, they are known as "Idol Pilots", pilots whose mass appeal and record sales mean as much - if not more - than actual fighting prowess. This is the story of the Toreishi sisters, five exceptionally cute girls and able pilots who work their way up from being lowly sitting ducks for more established acts, to becoming a successful act in their own right, capable of spectacular dogfights and even more spectacular pop concerts. Their success brings them some rivalry from other groups, however, and one of them, the fever Girls, are determined to shoot them out of the skies... and their boss is determined to make sure they don't get up there in the first place.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256405</url></doc>
