In search of the thief, Steele is attacked and left for dead. He is rescued by a kindly couple, but suffers from amnesia. He starts life afresh and is happy, until the return of his memory sends him back to resolve his old involvements.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586932</url></doc>
