<plot>A traveling salesvan makes a stop once a week in a small rural village in Sweden. The camera follows the daily lives of two of its solitary elderly inhabitants: Greta, 90 who has decided to take up residence in a rest home as her final abode, and Albert, 79 who lives with his three cats in a rundown house surrounded by weeds.
