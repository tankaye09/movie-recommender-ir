<plot>The film pulls together nine vignettes anchored by legendary performer Chris Steele that were filmed during his storied run with the company. With an array of must-see bonus features: his original videotaped auditions; an early strip show Steele performed at The Nob Hill Theater in San Francisco; and a new interview with Steele, plus audio commentary on all nine scenes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104735</url></doc>
