<plot>Chronic is an experimental narrative which explores the life of Gretchen, a woman who began using self-mutilation as a coping mechanism when she was a girl. The visually surreal scenes, which are comprised of both scripted and documentary footage, illustrate the culture Gretchen lives in, her inner life, and various relationships. A number of optical printing techniques and different film stocks were used to create different levels of perception so the viewer might experience Gretchen's story on an emotional or visceral level. The elements of the film are assembled together in attempt to create an understanding of the suicidal mind that goes beyond intellectual knowledge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?105169</url></doc>
