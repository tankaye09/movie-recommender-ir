<plot>Chinese folklore has it that during ancient times, thousands of crows randomly attacked and killed inhabitants of Feng Village just outside of the Great Wall. Lord Feng gathers town elders to seek a more planned defense after a disastrous attempt by a local band of men to take matters into their own hands to kill the crows. One villager Wang Mao-sheng separates himself from the mob to beg for a famed hermit bird catcher Tung Sheng to address and quell the attacks. Wang and his sister almost lose their lives after Tung's disastrous first confrontation. Meanwhile, hopeful village elders enlist the help of Tung's uncle who advised for a targeted hunt to seek out and kill the head crow. The village celebrates victory after Tung kills the leader of crows however he soon realizes that the death of the figure-head only meant a physical and not spiritual one after Lord Feng's grandson is suddenly bewitched by a mysterious force originating from the evil scourge. By now the remaining flock doubles in magnitude and strength with the imminent fear of more casualties to come. Bent on preserving family honor and completing his quest, Tung must now confront the spiritual challenge and the prospect of physical martyrdom to smash the crows and restore the balance of nature for the village.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663354</url></doc>
