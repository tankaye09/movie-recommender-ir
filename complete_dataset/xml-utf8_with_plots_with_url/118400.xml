<plot>Creepy and Eerie, which were first released by Warren Publishing in the 1960s, reached the peak of their popularity in the 1970s. They focused on macabre and otherworldly tales in the manner of "Tales from the Crypt" and "The Twilight Zone," with their success even prompting comics giants DC and Marvel to launch their own horror titles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118400</url></doc>
