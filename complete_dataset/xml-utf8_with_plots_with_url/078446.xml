<plot>Bombhunters explores the long-term consequences of war and genocide in Cambodia that persist in the form of landmines, unexploded ordnance (UXO), and other munitions. Through the lives and experiences of rural villagers who seek out and dismantle UXO to sell the scrap metal for profit, Bombhunters examines the social, cultural, and historical context of the legacy of war long after armed conflict has ended. Through the use of lipstick cameras as well as extensive fieldwork and interviews, Bombhunters profiles the experiences of individuals as they risk their lives to clear UXO from their land in order to both protect their families from harm and to make enough money to survive. The film also draws connections to other post-conflict nations around the world as their citizens continue to grapple with residual, persistent effects of war, and the complex realities of achieving "peace."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078446</url></doc>
