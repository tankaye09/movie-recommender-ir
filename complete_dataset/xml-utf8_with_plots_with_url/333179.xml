<plot>When Serena's lover leaves her at the altar, she decides to honeymoon alone. Her father hires a car for her. With Angelo, the driver, she sets out from Alto Adige for Berlin and points east (l'est). Plain, thin, with glasses, unsmiling, her hair pulled back, she meditates, she keeps a journal, she ignores Angelo. By Poland, they're talking; by Bratislava, they're companions, but she says little about herself. In Slovakia, Angelo's scruffy friend Jimbo tracks them down for a couple days' diversion. Then, her hair down and as lovers, they move on. Angelo makes assumptions about her, but the mystery remains: what is it about the East, for what is she searching? Where does he fit?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333179</url></doc>
