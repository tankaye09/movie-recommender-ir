<plot>The magician appears upon the stage and produces from the very air an exact duplicate of himself. The two men stand side by side, both of them the same size. Before the eyes of the audience one begins to grow until he has assumed the size of an immense giant. He looks down and laughs upon the little fellow beside him, when suddenly he begins growing smaller, until once more the two men are exactly the same size. One stands in front of the other, then both merge into one figure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?560306</url></doc>
