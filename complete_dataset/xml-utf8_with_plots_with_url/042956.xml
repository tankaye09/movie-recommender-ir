<plot>This quiz show was fairly simple in its concept: four contestants would try to answer questions on a variety of subjects (frequently related to entertainment) for points, with the contestant with the highest point total winning cash or prizes. The same four would compete together for four weeks before being replaced with a new set of players. In addition to the contest in the studio, viewers at home could also take a chance at winning a $10,000 jackpot by correctly guessing facts about the contestants such as their weight, age, or other personal details.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042956</url></doc>
