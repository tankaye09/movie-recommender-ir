<plot>A Greek gym-owner in New York, Michalis, is forced to ask for a loan from the richest man in Astoria, Antonis, who has connections with the underworld. Antonis also has a daughter, Martha, who is involved with the son of his friend Charis. Antonis willingly gives him the loan, without knowing, however, that his son-in-law Nikos, husband of his eldest daughter Elli, is using Michalis in a major scam to steal the money he has withheld from the internal revenue service. When Apergis' plan is completed and Antonis asks for the money owed, Michalis closes down the gym and leaves for Greece. Then, Antonis follows him to Athens, where he finds out about the entire plot. He also discovers that Nikos was one of the robbers of a bank in New York, which he was planning to flee with his young lover. Antonis apologizes to Michalis and allows his daughter to marry the man she loves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049984</url></doc>
