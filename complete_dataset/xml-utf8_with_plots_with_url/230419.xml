<plot>Hari is intelligent and Ram always feels that no one should be greater than him. Rams mother takes him away, while Hari remains with his father. As Haris father dies, his uncle and aunt bring him up and he becomes a police officer, while Rams mother somehow bring him up by working as a cook. A ministers brother, who is a scientist, invents a dangerous virus which spreads very fast, so he plans with Ram to spread the virus first and then release the antidote later and earn money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230419</url></doc>
