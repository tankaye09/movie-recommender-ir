<plot>Orphaned Sohan Lal is a wealthy businessman based in Bombay. While on vacation in Kashmir, he meets with beautiful Neela, and after a few misunderstandings both fall in love, and get married. When they return to Bombay, his Manager, V.K. Saxena asks him to travel to London for some business, which he does. Three months later when he returns home, he finds that Neela has not come to receive him at the airport, then on the way home, he is attacked, abducted, and placed in a cell, where a woman, Gulabiya, tells him that she is his sweetheart. With her help he manages to escape, has an accident, ends up in hospital, where he gets to meet a woman who calls him her son. Baffled and exasperated at these turn of events, he returns home to get a very cold response from Neela, who is about to inherit Rs.70 Lakhs from her deceased uncle.
