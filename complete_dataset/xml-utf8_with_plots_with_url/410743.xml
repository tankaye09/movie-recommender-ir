<plot>All Hollywood movies (and even most so-called "independent" films) that reach the public have budgets in the millions of dollars. However, there is a fascinating undercurrent of movie production thriving in America; movies shot on 16mm, Super 8mm, and even on video, all produced on budgets that would only pay for a week of catering on a Hollywood film. One such champion low-budget production is ICE FROM THE SUN. This film, directed by Eric Stanze, is notable for it's unique, cutting edge approach to the horror genre, as well as the fact that it is one of the most logistically complicated films ever made at this budget level. This documentary explores the process of producing such a film; the compromises, the victories, and the dedication of the filmmakers to a movie project that had all the odds against it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410743</url></doc>
