<plot>About the interplay between the official government channels and the men who acted largely behind the scenes during the course of peace process between Israel and Egypt. The film posits that while some of the men, such as Carter, Begin and Sadat, were driven by deeply held faith and conviction, others were military men hawks who in their later years came to see pace as the only viable option. Still others saw peace and stability in business terms. In any case, together, these heroes found a way to come together and drive the peace process. The film traces the confluence of factors that made the 1979 Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt possible. The term 'back door channels' has been in use since the early 1950s and used by government and foreign policy officials as well as intelligence operatives in referring to alternative methods for communicating across borders, using lines of communication not available to traditional official governmental and diplomatic entities nor to covert international intelligence agents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055096</url></doc>
