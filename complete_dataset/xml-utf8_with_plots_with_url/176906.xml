<plot>A re-creation of the expedition of the RMS Empress of Ireland's final journey, which took place on the 28th of May 1914. Nicole Henson boards the Ocean liner Empress of Ireland with her daughter Jennifer. Escaping a husband and a life she doesn't feel part of anymore, all Nicole can think about is taking her daughter back to her parents in England. To Nicole's dismay, Paul, her husband, forces his way on board the ship to find them. As the liner cruises proudly down the St Lawrence River, Nicole and Paul tear each other apart, fighting over Jennifer's future. When the Empress of Ireland is unexpectedly hit and torn open in the middle of the night by the Norwegian Collier The Storstad, whatever Nicole or Paul are fighting about is tossed overboard with their little Jennifer and both faced with impending disaster. But what really happened to the RMS Empress of Ireland? Were Paul and Nicole really on the ship? What happened to the rest of the passengers and crew?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176906</url></doc>
