<plot>Bette Midler performs four songs from her recording "Bette Midler Sings The Peggy Lee Songbook". Selections include "I'm A Woman," "He's A Tramp," "Fever," and an alternate take version of "Is That All There Is?" The program also includes interviews with Bette, along with Nicki Lee Foster and Holly Foster Wells (Peggy Lee's daughter and granddaughter.) along with never before seen vintage home movies from the Peggy Lee estate. A highlight is a home movie montage scored to Bette's recording of "Folks That Live on the Hill." This program was created as the exclusive DVD content for the Dual Disc release of Bette's Peggy Lee tribute.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066776</url></doc>
