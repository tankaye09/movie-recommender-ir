<plot>When fourteen-year-old Alonso is taken under the wing of Diego, one of the most confident and colorful personalities on the streets of "Little Village," it seems like life has finally taken a turn for the better. Things could hardly get worse. Each day Alonso returns home to a mother who is exhausted and depressed, and to an older brother, Lucky, who seems determined to try to run Alonso's life for him. To prove he can stand on his own, Alonso decides to skip school and test his mettle on the streets with Diego. But what happens next will test Alonso in ways he never imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338548</url></doc>
