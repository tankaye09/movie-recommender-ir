<plot>A Japanese-born ethnic Korean filmmaker chronicles her father's fierce loyalty to North Korea and the radical choices he makes due to his Marxist ideology. The father as a teen had moved from South Korea to Japan. He grew Marxist in his views and declares himself a North Korean due to his experiences of Japanese occupation, Korea's division and the Korean War. He envisioned a unified and communist Korean Peninsula. In 1971, he sent his three sons to Pyongyang. Thirty years later, his youngest child explores her father's choices. She filmed multiple trips to Pyongyang, offering unprecedented access to daily life in the secretive country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133755</url></doc>
