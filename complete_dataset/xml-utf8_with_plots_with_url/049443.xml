<plot>This is a very humorous series of views at England's great popular seaside resort and is full of laughable incidents. The fakirs are shown at work and various seaside amusements depicted, among them a group of coster women and children in wading. The whole scene is excellent throughout, very sharp and clear photographically.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049443</url></doc>
