<plot>This comedy, 'about being who you want to be and doing what you want to do', centres on a bar in Peckham whose customers are struggling through the hottest day of the summer. The proprietor Bandana Bob is fighting off a takeover bid from a ruthless developer, while looking out for the dilemmas of his regulars. Matty, Bob's best mate, is under pressure from Carla, his terrifyingly maternal girlfriend. Jimmy, a boxer struggling to make his comeback but thwarted by his sneaky manager, is worried about how to support his family. And Kelly, an aspiring actress with a crush on Bob, must take the plunge with a role of 'epic proportions' to overcome her shyness and show the busy landlord how she feels.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203304</url></doc>
