<plot>Inspector Vishnu lives with his wife, Meenu, and a child. He is a honest and diligent Police Officer, and is presently investigating a corrupt businessman and gangster named Kamraj. When Kamraj starts to feel the pressure, he warns Vishnu, in vain. One day when Vishnu returns home, he finds that Meenu and his child have been killed. Enraged he goes to avenge their deaths, and kills some of Kamraj's associates. As a result he gets dismissed from the police force, and goes into hiding. To make matters worst, his brother-in-law, Sub-Inspector Jairam has been assigned to bring him to justice. Apparently, Jairam knows where Vishnu is hiding, and all he has to do is go there and arrest him. Before he could do so, Vishnu is killed, and now it is Jairam's turn to avenge his death. Will he be able to do so without killing anyone; getting caught; losing his job; and getting his wife, Bindu, killed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250825</url></doc>
