<plot>BILLY is a hit man, shot in the same instant that his heart broke: his girlfriend, SARAH, was killed right before his eyes. Now, he's a walking dead man, with a hole in his chest and a chip on his shoulder, dragging KELLY, the young forensic pathologist who discovered him, along on his mission of revenge. He's intent on finding his killers before his life ticks away - even if they're closer to him than he thinks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?132976</url></doc>
