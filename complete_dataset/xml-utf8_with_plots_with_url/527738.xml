<plot>Something of an indirect predecessor to "American Bandstand" (Like "Bandstand," it originated in Philadelphia and had many of the same technical crew), this teen-oriented music-variety program was hosted by veteran bandleader/performer Paul Whiteman. Whiteman, a fixture on the American pop music scene since the early 1920's, genuinely enjoyed doing this show, wearing loud sport clothes, using the kids' catch phrases of that period ("Real gone, man!"), and handing the sponsors' Tootsie Rolls and chewing gum out of a paper bag. A good judge of talent (Bing Crosby got his start with Whiteman's band in the late-1920's), Whiteman gave both Dick Clark and Bobby Rydell major early breaks on this program, as well as future recording company executive Bernie Lowe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?527738</url></doc>
