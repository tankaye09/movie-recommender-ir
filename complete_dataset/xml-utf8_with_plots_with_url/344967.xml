<plot>Misaki, a young woman struggling to succeed in the publishing business needs to convince Nagase, a once-popular author, to finish a new book after two years of writer's block. When Nagase finally produces something, Misaki rejects it as unworthy of his talents, even though her job depends on getting something published. Unaccustomed to this kind of treatment, Nagase comes to respect and even admire her. Meanwhile, Nagase's aging mother is trying to set her son up with a young woman she thinks will be a perfect match for him. How will he react when he discovers who Miss Right really is?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344967</url></doc>
