<plot>The panel would view a short but funny and fairly elaborate clip during the course of which actor Paul Soles would secretly break an obscure law from some remote corner of the Great White North. A policeman would arrive to apprehend the miscreant. The panel would then make a lot of funny quips, and try to guess which law had been broken. Austin Willis would finally reveal the answer. There were two or three laws dealt with in each instalment of the programme.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604854</url></doc>
