<plot>What was your worst break-up? How did you get over it? Who do you date next? Why online dating? Why speed dating? Why Cuddle Parties? Why are there more single people out there now than there ever have been before? The new documentary Break-Up Date attempts to answer these questions by following regular people who are at that awkward and uncertain time between relationships when one is confronted with the dating world that favors appearance over substance. Featuring candid and funny interviews with filmmakers, authors, dating coaches, divorce attorneys and talk show hosts, Break-Up Date is like a romantic comedy in documentary form; a smarter, more insightful alternative to the empty-headed dating realty shows on television. This is a movie everyone can relate to, whether you want to or not.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082117</url></doc>
