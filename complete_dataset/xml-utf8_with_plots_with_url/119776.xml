<plot>"This picture shows the cruiser 'Detroit' lying at anchor in the Dry Tortugas. The effect produced is as though the vessel were approaching and passing the audience. The decks are filled with marines and sailors, while at the companionways of the vessel are clustered many boats and launches. The American flag is waving from the stern. The picture is sharp and clear."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119776</url></doc>
