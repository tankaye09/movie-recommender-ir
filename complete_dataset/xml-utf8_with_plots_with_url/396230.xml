<plot>A trucker helps a mother and son out of a blizzard and into a small hotel in the middle of the night, where others have been driven by the weather to spend a horrifying night together, as they discover that the hotel's clerk is really a demon set on rape and murder. One by one the beast picks them off, until the final climax, in this talky and sometimes humorous horror film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396230</url></doc>
