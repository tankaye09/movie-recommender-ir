<plot>At 21 miles wide and very, very cold, the English Channel is regarded the world over as one of the ultimate swimming challenges. Achieving such a goal can push both mind and body to their limits and sometimes beyond. Two Swimmers explores the bond between a young athlete and his coach as they attempt to swim the Channel in the summer of 2005, and the dramatic events that follow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622831</url></doc>
