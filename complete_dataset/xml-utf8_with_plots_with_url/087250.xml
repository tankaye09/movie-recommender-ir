<plot>Three-time Juno winner and Grammy-nominated rapper K-os is recruited by CBC to compose a score for the acclaimed CBC Radio Orchestra - in less than four weeks. In a unique role for a broadcaster, CBC was not only there to document the entire affair for its radio, TV and Internet services, the Corp was an active creative partner through its Radio Orchestra - the last remaining one in North America . Burning To Shine not only blurs the line between hip-hop &amp; classical, but also between a public broadcaster and one of its very public citizens, K-os. The documentary reveals the intimate struggle of a red-hot but complex hip-hop artist dealing with a unique challenge, at an important time in his ascendant career. The combination of Kos' impulsive tendencies in contrast to the disciplined rigors of both classical composition and TV/radio broadcasting, makes for natural tension. With only two and a half hours to perform a perfect take with the 30-piece orchestra, Burning To Shine culminates in a triumphant performance of the completed song by K-os with the CBC Radio Orchestra (including tablas, guitar, drums &amp; turntables).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087250</url></doc>
