<plot>This satire skews popularity &amp; power, relationships, adolescence, and celebrity in the setting that is so near and dear to our hearts - high school. The story centers around Todd and Julia, the most adorable and popular couple in high school history. It is told from the not-so-objective perspectives of Todd's buddy, Julia's BFF, and the school guidance counselor. Each narrator relives events that led to one of the biggest blowups the school has ever seen ... and when they become seniors, the stakes couldn't be any higher!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238984</url></doc>
