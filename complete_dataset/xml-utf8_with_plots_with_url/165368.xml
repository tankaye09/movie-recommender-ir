<plot>Matthew Kotash, once a young celebrity in the art world is slipping away fast into the land of has-beens. His long-time art dealer, Ronny, is now an ungracefully aging hipster who desperately wants his meal ticket back. But Matthew refuses to paint. His creativity comes at too high a cost - his inspiration is carnage - blood, guts and limbs. Not surprisingly, this lead to a dreadful breakdown in the past. Nevertheless, an eager Ronny arranges a teaching job for Matthew at an art school in Koda Lake, a small town in the middle of nowhere. It's a "therapeutic" measure for Matthew - a means to conquer his need to paint in the "safety" of a country retreat... That is, until Eddie comes into his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165368</url></doc>
