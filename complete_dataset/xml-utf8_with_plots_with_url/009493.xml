<plot>Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, is the self-proclaimed "toughest sheriff in America." The inmates in his outdoor desert jail would probably agree. Dressed in pink underwear and being fed on a budget of $.33 a meal, they broil in the Arizona heat without air conditioning, television, or cigarettes. Filmmaker Ryan Noble spends a day with Sheriff Joe as he darts back and forth between his jail, community meetings, and the ever-present media opportunities. Between the various odd spectacles Joe lays out his philosophies about law enforcement and the future of America's penal system. In spite of the film's subtle jabs at the Sheriff, it was named in a billion dollar lawsuit against the Sheriff and Maricopa County, which saw its distribution permanently shut down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009493</url></doc>
