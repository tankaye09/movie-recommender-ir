<plot>When his beloved gas station closes and his wife, Xaviera, throws him out of the house, Henry Dodd, a simple honest young man gets a job as TV spokesman for Rex Madden, a macho tycoon, and his questionable enterprises. Henry falls in love with Bonnie, a feisty woman who encourages him to follow his dream far away from the advertising campaigns that have made the tycoon a fortune. Enraged, Rex deceptively separates the two lovers, tries to teach Henry the rules of machismo, and transform him into a "Real Man". But...Bonnie is a force to be reckoned with and determined to get her man back. Can she return before Henry is destroyed, or will he become a card-carrying member of the "HeMan-HateWoman" club? The battle for Henry's soul is played out in televised ad campaigns and in the corporate boardroom, until Henry finally realizes what it is to be a "Real Man".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235628</url></doc>
