<plot>"Here is the staunch little transport 'Mascotte' arriving at Tampa with the 2nd Battalion of 24th Colored Infantry on board. Her speed is shown by the high bow spray she throws. Clouds of exhaust steam rise from the port-hole at the water line. A stiff breeze is blowing, and her three flags stand out as straight as boards. Desks literally covered with transports a very attractive picture, owing to bright sunshine, sharp shadow contrasts and brilliant wave effects."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514866</url></doc>
