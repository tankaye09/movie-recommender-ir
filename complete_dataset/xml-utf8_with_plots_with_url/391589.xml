<plot>Shankar lives in a remote village in rural India with his mother and sister, Manju, and drives a horse-carriage for a living. The main employer in the region is a kind-hearted businessman Maganlal. When Maganlal announces that he would like to undertake a religious pilgrimage, his son, Kundan, takes over and wants to cut back on labor and mechanize the business - thus leading to loss in jobs. He also introduces a bus thus taking away business from the horse-carriage drivers. This angers the community and they ask Kundan to reconsider, and he flats refuses - but agrees to withdraw the bus provided Shankar races it with his horse-carriage. Watch the action unfold as Shankar unites a divided village, and how he sets about to keep his faith in winning this race between man and machine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391589</url></doc>
