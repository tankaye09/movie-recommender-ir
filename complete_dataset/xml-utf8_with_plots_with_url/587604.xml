<plot>In 1939, in New York, Betty Boop is a girl adored by her neighbors and a hard worker: she sells shoes in a shoe store along the day, and sings in the Bubble Club in the night. Betty Boop dreams with the handsome millionaire Wando Van Lavish, for whom she is in love. The simple and honest Fred, who sells bars of ice on the streets of her neighborhood, has a crush on her. Meanwhile, Betty meets Wando in the night-club and he invites her for a date. Then, he schedules a meeting at his parent's house, and Betty Boop believes he will propose her. When her uncle Mischa, the owner of the Bubble Club, is threatened by the gang of the mobster Throat because he can not pay his debts with him, the gangster decides to take the club and Betty Boop for him. The gang kidnaps Betty, and she escapes, but the criminals follow her with the intention of killing her. She runaway with the coward Wando, but is saved by Fred.
