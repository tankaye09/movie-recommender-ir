<plot>Life rarely goes as planned for any of us. But when you're the family golden boy backed by lofty expectations and an expensive education that realization can hit a little bit harder. Stanley Gardener has returned to his hometown after years of higher education and an aborted career with nothing to show for it. He has moved in with his eccentric high school friend Jockey while training for a job at the local call centre. Cubicle walls and a headset. Hardly his dream come true. It's his first day "on the floor" and despite the depression he may feel over travelling so far and so long only to end up where he started, he and his fellow newbie Laura meet the people who will make the drudgery tolerable... even entertaining. As Stanley's brother Dirk puts in time at the local pawn shop under the cantankerous eye of the permanently pissed-off Howard, Jockey's unbalanced outlook, Duncan's sexual retardation and Paul's sly wisdom begin to pave the dead end dirt road they find themselves upon. 'Phone Whores' takes you along on Stanley's journey where he learns that sometimes it isn't what you do, it's how you do it, why you do it, and maybe most importantly, it's who you do it with.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431373</url></doc>
