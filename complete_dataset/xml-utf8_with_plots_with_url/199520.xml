<plot>BRANDON GOODWIN, 17, is no different from any other teen that feels invincible and determined to live his life his way on his terms with no regard for conventional wisdom. Brandon's coming of age is him coming to grips with his ego clashing with his mortality in the hostile inner-city of South Central Los Angeles. Priding himself on being a talented aspiring actor destined for greatness he walks a thin line between self-destruction and potential as this man-child searches for an identity to call his own. Using anger and raw ambition as his fuel to crush his obstacles he is in for a rude awakening once he discovers he is only human after all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199520</url></doc>
