<plot>Until the age of 55, Hanita Leshem had no idea about her past. What was her name, who were her parents, where was she born, and where did she spend the first seven years of her life, during World War II? At the age of seven, Hanita arrived in Israel in 1947, by boat, and was adopted. Her new parents gave her the name Hanita. Her parents wanted her to believe that she was their real daughter and wouldn't give her any information about her past. They died, taking with them the secret to the grave. At the end of four years of a careful worldwide investigation, Israel Television took Hanita to Europe to the places were she was and the people she was with in the first seven years of her life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232370</url></doc>
