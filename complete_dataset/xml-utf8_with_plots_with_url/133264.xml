<plot>For more than twenty years, the murder of an African American youth in rural South Carolina has gone unpunished, unsolved and un-investigated. But that changes when Charlotte Times reporter Matt Harper meets an idealistic young law student bent on discovering the truth. Harper undertakes the investigation despite the opposition of his publisher, violent threats from mysterious forces, a break-up with his fianc√©e and his father's cancer diagnosis. Deadline is a story of murder, family, race, and of redemption - for a small Southern town and for Matt Harper.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133264</url></doc>
