<plot>It's off season at a small resort town, where Sam, an underachiever with an epileptic sleep disorder, works the graveyard shift of an empty hotel. The sight of a beautiful call girl stirs a ripple in his stagnant heart, and he becomes determined to win her love -- and lose his virginity along the way. But, more than just sex, he wants love and understanding. Between his minister father and drug-dealing friends, the only person who really seems to empathize with him isn't the call girl, but her transvestite brother. Unfortunately for Chris/Crystal, Sam doesn't want her affection and so the nightmare begins as a random act of violence towards her sets off a chain of events. From the salvation of a killing bully, to an awkward encounter with a virgin suffering an epileptic sleep disorder, to a transvestite's reunion with a past she left behind as a reckless man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015368</url></doc>
