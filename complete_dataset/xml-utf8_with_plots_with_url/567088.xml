<plot>The show typically consists of JR directing the show on location, usually in someone's house or a very odd / unique location. He then plays various clips of him doing comedy segments in various locations, and also shows clips from his early years of trying to produce a television show. There are also dramatic comedy portions, where we catch a glimpse at the behind the scenes world of television production, and see well known actors and musicians speaking off-the-cuff. JR also likes to include a telemarketer call in the credits, where he pulls pranks on the telemarketers that call him and tapes it on video.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567088</url></doc>
