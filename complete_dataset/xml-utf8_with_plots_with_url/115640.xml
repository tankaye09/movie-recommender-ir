<plot>As the final resting piece in a short-lived yet meteoric existence, avant noise/grind cult favorites Corn on Macabre present us with an onslaught of visual entertainment for the ages. Featured here are the band's music videos for "You're Okay, I'm Undead," and "Pteradactyl Shutdown," shot entirely to film and featuring a full cast of D.C. area notables. As a special treat, the band has also provided viewers with the entire set of their groundbreaking Krazy Fest V performance in Louisville, KY in the summer of 2002. All features are captured in broadcast-quality audio and video and utilize multi-angle camera perspectives. Chock full of bonus features and surprises, Corn on Macabre invites you to kill the lights, grab some popcorn, and let the absurdity begin!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115640</url></doc>
