Their love and respect for each other is put to the test when Shekar's parents, and his unmarried sister decide to move in with them in their tiny apartment. Shekar's income is not enough to take care of their extended family, and to make matters worse, Shekar loses his job. Indu and Shekar decide that Indu must find employment, which she does, much to the dismay of her in-laws. Things get worse when Shekar's dad, Raghunath, witnesses Indu in the company of a male in a fancy restaurant, and thinks that she is having an affair. When told about this incident, Shekar shakes his head with disbelief, then changes his mind when he finds out that Indu has not only being going out with another male, but also with her boss, Mr. Dutt.
