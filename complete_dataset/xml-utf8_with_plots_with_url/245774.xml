<plot>To anyone who suffered at the hands of an older brother, be grateful you don't have a sibling like horrid henry. He can easily make a saint swear with his antics; Nanny 911, Supernanny, Little Angels, house of tiny tear-aways, none of the child specialists behind them could sort him out. Odd however since his brother, Peter is nothing like him, he's everything that Henry isn't and everything Henry's come to despise about how he (Henry) must behave. In short He (Henry) is proof that evolution can go in reverse, surprising his parents haven't packed him off to military school or put him up for adoption...then again he'd most likely be sent back home as neither organization could deal with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245774</url></doc>
