<plot>On a warm weekend in June, a group of friends venture to the mountains for a weekend getaway. No parents, no professors, just pure unadulterated fun and games. Little do they know, they're not alone. Out in the wilderness, just a stone's throw away at the edge of the tree line, there is a dark presence waiting and watching the group. One of the main protagonists, Rachel is the first to realize that there is peril in the woods beyond the rickety old cabin, where they'll be sleeping. Josh (who wants nothing more than to have the nerve to approach Rachel and tell her how much he adores her) politely humors her and her worries of them never making it home again. The rest of the group however, laughs off her comments about the rustling in the bushes, the sounds of crazy laughter, and the shadows that keep moving around. Is she just crazy, or are they going to be picked off one by one?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109152</url></doc>
