<plot>Cain Matthews is a would-be quantum physicist trudging through menial jobs while pursuing his lifelong passion: time-travel. Supported (financially and otherwise) by his Dutch paramour Eisje, he's spent many sleepless nights experimenting in his apartment. Until now. A breakthrough is reached and Cain accidentally travels into the future where he spends years perfecting his device with the advanced technology. He returns to Eisje in the present a changed man - darker, evasive - but his reunion is short lived. Lynn and Penny, two treacherous repo men from the future are hot on Cain's tail to retrieve the stolen machine implants in his body. Not only would Cain be stranded in a time not his own, but the surgery to extract the parts has proved fatal. He's managed to elude his pursuers until now, but when Cain is finally cornered, even his brilliant mind may not help him survive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603038</url></doc>
