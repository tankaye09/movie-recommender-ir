<plot>Ego Break is a short comedy about a 30-year-old office worker named Mike who must face off against his childhood bully Henderson in the video game Super Mario Bros. At the age of 10 Henderson moves to the city of Cloverdale and enrolls in the Summer Kid Care Program where he meets 10-year-old Mike. Soon after they meet, conflict erupts between the two over the Video Game Super Mario Bros., and Henderson (a natural bully) submits Mike to the most brutal form of childhood shaming in existence; worse than the Orel Hershiser, and more feared than The Rear Admiral... the dreaded Martin Van Buren. Twenty years later, Mike, still living with the broken ego of his childhood, discovers Henderson has been hired at his office. The childhood bullying re-emerges and threatens Mike's pride and his chances of asking out the girl of his dreams. Mike, with the help of his coworker Ray, decide to take action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166365</url></doc>
