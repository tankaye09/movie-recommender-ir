<plot>With one big score, small time drug dealer Franco is sure he'll be able to leave the business forever and start a legitimate life. But when one of Franco's clients, a two bit junkie named Duane, manages to put two and two together and figure out where Franco got his supply, he sells him out. Caught by surprise, Franco becomes the victim of a brutal torture at the hands of Virgil Ryker and two of his hoods. Not being one to trust a heroin addict, Franco's got himself a backup plan, and he lays it all on the line, telling Virgil exactly who his contact is, and setting a spiral in motion that may leave everyone dead in the process. A slick drama with rapid dialogue and a plot full of twists and turns, One Last Fix answers the question "If you can't trust a heroin addict, who can you trust?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412245</url></doc>
