<plot>After nine years of trial and error and fighting the current medical philosophy, a mother does the impossible. She finds a treatment for Down Syndrome, reversing the damage and substantially increasing IQ and quality of life. After 2 years of remarkable progress with her own son, she shares her new discovery with other parents and begins a small study. The results are spectacular. Each child is not only learning new skills and abilities but all are experiencing a new social life. The oldest child, at 25, has come back from the world of Alzheimer's in only eight months. After success with the small group of children, researchers at Stanford University Down Syndrome Research Center, applaud her work and begin the process of clinical trials to prove the efficacy of her new protocol.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099713</url></doc>
