<plot>Salty just wants to launch his boat and sail off, but crooks have bought the boat yard to build condos. When he falls in love with triplet sisters things begin to spiral out of control. Soon, his boat's bull dozed, his job is gone and he's left broke and sleeping on a park bench in the rain. But the tide will turn. Redeemed by the love of one of the triplets, he becomes a hero by dint of his natural curiosity and dumb luck.</plot><plot>Salty just wants to launch his boat and sail off, but crooks have bought the boat yard to build condos.
