<plot>A theatrical feature film based on the book "Days of Rage" ('Dias de Ira') by Roldao Arruda. The feature film "Days of Rage" ('Dias de Ira') is set in Sao Paulo in the 80's and takes us into Truman Capote's (In Cold Blood) style and intensity from the dark and unknown universe of male prostitution, through the disturbed and troubled mind of a prostitute man called Fortunato Botton, a supposed serial killer. Though a male prostitute since teenage age, he always denied being gay. The 80's, the beginning of AIDS, claimed by many the "Gay Pest"; a period marked by fanatic violence against homosexual. Botton died in prison, until a real answer to his case.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144827</url></doc>
