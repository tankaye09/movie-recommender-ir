<plot>Hank Penny and Sue Thompson, cleaning up the barn waiting the arrival of Webb Pierce and His Wanderin' Boys (and not "Wonderin' Boys despite the title typo), perform "Tater Pie", and Marion Colby, playing a Chicago newspaper reporter (Miss Colby), comes in and sings "If It Weren't For Girls." Sue Thompson replies with "I"m Not That Kind of Girl, Boys (unless you ask me)", and Webb and band show up and do Pierce's current hit "Slowly." Red Sovine and Marion Colby then duet the best number in this short, "Are You Mine", which livens things up a bit until Pierce breaks out his newest recording, "I'm Going to Fall Out of Love With You." The short ends with Pierce and Sovine doing "In the Jailhouse Now."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649363</url></doc>
