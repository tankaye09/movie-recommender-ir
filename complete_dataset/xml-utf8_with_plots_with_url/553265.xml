<plot>Callie Khouri's seminal, Oscar-winningÂ® screenplay for Thelma &amp; Louise, released in 1991, gave voice to a profound cultural moment and became one of the most provocative cinematic landmarks of the '90s. It was the Kentucky native's first attempt at a screenplay. In this enlightening interview, Khouri describes how spending years doing music video production in the '80s inspired her not only to write, but to write with a purpose. A passionate activist with a resume that includes Something to Talk About and her adaptation of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which she also directed, Khouri discusses in detail the pressure of living up to such early acclaim, what it's like to be a woman in the industry, and how the state of the world around you fuels and shapes your creative mindset. Also a frequent script doctor and former Writers Guild of America board member, Khouri delves into the ongoing issues facing the WGA, its membership, and its much-maligned arbitration process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553265</url></doc>
