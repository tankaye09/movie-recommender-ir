<plot>This film follows significant events for Gregory and Arthur during six months of their college lives. On the night of his father's funeral, Gregory is visited by an old high school flame, Emily. She provides comfort for the night, and legal problems within the week. The strength of Gregory and Arthur's friendship is tested when Gregory covers up the truth of the legal situation. Meanwhile, Arthur uses some deception of his own to get what he wants with the girl he's most interested in, even if at the expense of the feelings of his present girlfriend. How do the two friends interact when lies get in the way? How do they change?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592026</url></doc>
