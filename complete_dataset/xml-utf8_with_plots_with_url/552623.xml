<plot>E.G. Marshall returns as the head of the law firm that he portrayed in the 1961 to 1965 tv series. This time his partners are his son (Bridges) and his granddaughter (Plimpton). This is projected to be the first of a series of films. In this episode a man (Larroquette) murders the man who assaulted and raped his young daughter years before and was released from prison after serving just a few years. Tried for first degree murder, the team has to come up with a defense approaching he and his families' mental state. Specifically his daughter had to be placed in a mental ward as the result of the attack after a series of attempted suicides, his older daughter had run away from home because she could not stand the depressing atmosphere, and he simply thought of nothing but the man's death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?552623</url></doc>
