<plot>Wendy works in a small 1-hour photograph developing shop. She is open late one evening and says goodbye to her friend Trish who works next door. When she is an hour away from closing she gets a call from a Mr Stanley to say he will pick his pictures up in an hour. She sets about developing them to find blurry images of bound feet and hands etc. Her fear rises even more when the pictures start to be of her, her house, her at work etc. When the phone rings again Wendy answers it to find that Mr Stanley is coming for his pictures and will not be stopped.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341200</url></doc>
