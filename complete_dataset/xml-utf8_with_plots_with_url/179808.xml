<plot>A visually dark and comic film, set in a society lost within its endless, self-defeating pursuits, EPHEMERAL is the story of how a seemingly ordinary train trip home, turns into much more than its weary passengers expect. They unknowingly begin their symbolic journey in solitude, and as they travel the entire route, they succumb to the bittersweet nature of human behaviour. An empty cola can which begins as a distraction, triggers a sequence of events evoked by each passenger's hopes, dreams and yearning for contentment. It also beckons their darker side, leading them to ultimate greed and division. And as their journey comes to an end, they find themselves arriving back to the very beginning. How does an empty cola can have the power to unite them, divide them and punish them?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?179808</url></doc>
