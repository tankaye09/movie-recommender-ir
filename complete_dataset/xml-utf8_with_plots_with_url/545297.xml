<plot>A penniless Gary Coleman gets a job as Jennifer Lopez's "bootyguard" and finds himself the sole protector of Jennifer's rear end. Borrowing a gun from Charlton Heston's gun shop, he arrives at Jennifer's mansion where he is given his orders: He must protect Jennifer's most prized asset at all costs and accompany her wherever she goes, including a birthday party thrown for former president Bill Clinton. At the party a sexually charged Bill gets Jennifer alone in his private garden and tries to kiss her ass, forcing Jennifer to scream for help. Gary comes to her aid and engages Bill and his secret service agents in a climactic and tragic showdown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545297</url></doc>
