<plot>One day before his high school graduation, Taky Kimura was taken into the Japanese American Internment Camp. Emerging from the camp after the war, he was a dispirited and broken young man. Unable to find a job and having no money to continue his college education, he and his family began to operate a local supermarket store. In his mid-thirties, he met the eighteen year old up-and-coming martial arts expert Bruce Lee. Joining Bruce's early kung-fu club, Taky became Bruce's best friend. Together, they sparred, practiced, and eventually founded Bruce Lee's first Jeet Kuen Do Club in the basement of Taky's supermarket. Because of his friendship with Bruce and study of the philosophy behind martial arts, Taky was able to turn his life around. His is a story of emotional healing and growth. At 75 now, Taky still teaches Jun Fan Kung-Fu in the basement of his supermarket, for free.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529653</url></doc>
