<plot>A little overweight man has been invited by a friendly couple to a posh restaurant. They have just finished dinner and he keeps on complaining, that any other human being is doing better than himself and that fate obviously denies him a happy life professionally and emotionally. Attending to their own problems, the interpersonal relations of the patrons at adjacent tables become a little troublesome, too, and tension seems to rise. Although the guest are not related over the borders of their tables, all of them are forced by their roles and status to indulge into a social interaction, whose atrocious outcome happens to be inevitable, even you wouldn't have thought so, based on the everyday life situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?258309</url></doc>
