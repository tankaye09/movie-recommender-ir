<plot>An afternoon with Daminhao Experienca, a 72 years old musician, who recorded more than 30 albums and decided to live as a beggar in the streets of Ipanema Beach, on Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Painter, poet, singer, pimp, Daminhao is an outsider by definition. His polemic ideas about sex, drugs, politics and religion are expressed in his music, which is influenced by Brazilian rhythms, folkloric songs and rock. Using the approach of direct cinema, the film walks with Daminhao by the streets, interacting with the city and with his music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125117</url></doc>
