<plot>Martin's life was normal. Martin's life was dull. Every day he'd go through the same routine, work at the same desk, crunch the same numbers, and stare at the same people. Until she came along, the "new girl" in the office. Beautiful, full of life and energy and utterly unlike the others in the office. Utterly unlike him. Now Martin's life is different. Strange dreams leave him disorientated and drenched in sweat; his mouth is dry and his head is spinning; there's water everywhere, and fish... lots of fish. What does it all mean? Is he losing his mind or falling in love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651171</url></doc>
