<plot>Johanna Stauding's boring life in Hamburg is suddenly shaken up when her husband dies suddenly. Going through his papers she discovers that he has bought a house in Denmark, and it is in the name of a strange woman, Andrea Loren. Johanna goes to confront her, and traces her in a tawdry club in the red light district, and Ms Loren is a blousey singer of Dietrich's songs. In this case opposites repel, but they agree to have a quick chat in Andrea's nearby flat. The chat is interrupted by the arrival of Romanian gangsters who are out to kill her, and Johanna knocks one of them out. The two woman are suddenly united and run for it. Various escapades follow, not all of them very convincing, as they make their way to the safety of the house in Denmark. On her own for a few minutes, Johanna tries the television, but it's in Danish. Fiddling with the video remote control she starts a tape running, and it is a home movie that her late husband took there, with Andrea.
