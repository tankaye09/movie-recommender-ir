<plot>An entry in the series of Columbia cartoons based on the newspaper comic strip, "L'il Abner", by Al Capp. Character creator and taking the money is the only thing Capp had in connection with this bottom-of-the-barrel series, and should not be blamed with any writing involved. These are just a series of cartoons based on hillbilly characters and could have just as well been called "Ozark Ike and Friends" as far as resembling the actual strip relative to style and wit. Abner goes to the big city to acquire some cultural polish and returns only with a bathtub which makes him unpopular with everybody but Daisy Mae. Whoever wrote this evidently didn't read the comic strip or they would have known that not a month went by in Dogpatch that Mammy Yokum wasn't scrubbing Pappy or Abner in a wooden tub...and also clipping their toe-nails.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035751</url></doc>
