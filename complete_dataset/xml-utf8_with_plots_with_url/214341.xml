<plot>We followed Ghostface, along with his crew of the Theodore Unit, across the country to get a glimpse into the life on tour of one of the biggest stars in hip-hop. Everything from thrilling shows, candid backstage moments, and exclusive interviews make this a DVD that any Ghostface fan should not live without. Ghostface is joined by his fellow Wu-Tang member Capadonna, as well as Trife Da God, Du Lilz, Solomon Childs, Wigs and more! After filming six different shows in six different venues, we took the greatest moments of each to make the single greatest Ghostface performance ever seen. Experience a backstage pass with the greatest lyricist of all time!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214341</url></doc>
