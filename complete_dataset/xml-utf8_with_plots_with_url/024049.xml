<plot>"From the thick underbrush where the Filipinos are massed comes volley after volley. Suddenly, with impetuous rush, Funston's men appear. They pause but a moment, to fire, reload and fire. The color bearer falls, but the standard is caught up by brave Sergeant Squire and waves undaunted in the smoke and din of the receding battle. This is one of the best battle pictures ever made. The first firing is done directly toward the front of the picture, and the advance of the U.S. troops apparently through the screen is very exciting; the gradual disappearance of the fighters sustaining the interest to the end."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024049</url></doc>
