<plot>A most astounding film, showing a lady with three heads. These are taken away one after the other, and seem to be quite as lively when separated from the body as they were when united. The conjuror who is performing the trick also removes his own head without suffering any inconvenience, and walks about without it. There are also any number of other changes in this film, which has to be seen to be fully appreciated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080752</url></doc>
