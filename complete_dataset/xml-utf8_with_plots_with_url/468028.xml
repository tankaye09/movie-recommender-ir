<plot>Two maids in a Tel Aviv hotel. Etti and Shimi. Hot. Cute. Sweet. Funny. Touching. Sad. Sensitive. Searching for their way in life - both alone and together. Etti who signed in eight years ago as she was tired of the world and perhaps of herself. Shimrit arrived only yesterday, her whole life ahead of her, wondering if it will be spent in this hotel. On each door there is a small card that says "Please make up my room" but in each room, among the used sheets and behind the small bottles in the mini-bar, there is a story waiting to be told. Room Service - a series about high hopes and disappointments in one hotel on the coast of the Mediterranean sea.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?468028</url></doc>
