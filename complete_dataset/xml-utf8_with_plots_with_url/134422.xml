<plot>In the wake of the USSR's launching of Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, America faced a challenge to its leadership. This short emphasizes the necessity of increasing education in the sciences. More students must go to college and gain the knowledge and experience that America must have to keep pace in the world through the next decade. The University of Buffalo is featured as an example of an urban university that is increasing spending in medicine, international affairs, physics, and other areas to ensure that students will be ready to meet challenges of the future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134422</url></doc>
