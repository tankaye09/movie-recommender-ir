<plot>How do Americans decide what food to eat? What is more important: quantity or quality, taste or price? MONTANA FARE examines contemporary food culture in rural Montana through the eyes of two women who try to feed their families while living fifty miles from the nearest grocery store. Once a suburbanite living in Columbus, Ohio, Jenny Sabo explores her decision to move to southwest Montana to try her hand at producing as much of her own food as possible. Meanwhile, in northern Montana, Native American tribal elder Minerva Allen examines the tension between traditional food and processed food on the Fort Belknap Reservation. This short 20-minute film covers a number of relevant food issues, including nutrition, changing taste preferences and homogenization, food access and security, disassociation and distance from food, and public health. Along with breathtaking scenery and down-to-earth, poignant discussions with both women, MONTANA FARE captures how two people with distinct pasts and different futures decide what food to put on the table.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376277</url></doc>
