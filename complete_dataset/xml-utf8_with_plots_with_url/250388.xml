<plot>Craig, young photojournalist, is threatened of losing his job if he doesn't get the photograph of a boy with an extraordinary deformity who lives with his alcoholic mother Loraine in a squatted house in London. Loraine refuses Craig's offer in order to protect her traumatized son but eventually her addiction will take over. Craig, taking advantage of that, will force his way into the house... leading to an unexpected encounter. Hunted reflects the idea of 'animalized' people in our modern society where human values are lost as a reaction to our weaknesses and ignorance. The similarities between patterns of human and animal behavior are notorious specially in big cities where the pressure for survival forces people to attack each other as animals of prey. Eventually the hunter becomes the hunted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250388</url></doc>
