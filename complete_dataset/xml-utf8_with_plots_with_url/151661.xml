<plot>Sadie makes mistake after mistake at work. Kelly, a senior employee with a bondage bent, decides that disciplinary action with ropes and gags is required to teach the new worker the meaning of efficiency. Sadie soon escapes and, catching Kelly in a mistake, shows her that turnabout is fair play. Unfortunately for the two lovely ladies, their boss decides that their bondage play is distracting them from their work and teaches them both a lesson.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151661</url></doc>
