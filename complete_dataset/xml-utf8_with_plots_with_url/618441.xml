<plot>Tripling is the story of a resistance movement, an interrogator and three mens journey toward their end. It is told with a visual and musical universe in order to challenge the expectations that the typical Hollywood drama has created. The movie has been created to fit in with the post-rock-music created by the band Thunderbears, who played live in front of the movie when it was shown the first two times. Hence the movie pace is very slow (or sometimes fast) in accordance with the music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?618441</url></doc>
