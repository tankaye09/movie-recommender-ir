<plot>It's Mother's Day eve. Thompson and his girlfriend, Sherry, spend a wonderful evening together. As a mother of a young daughter, Sherry revels in her upcoming day. She also wonders how Thompson handles the distance from his mother all the way in Nigeria, West Africa. To him, this distance is the norm in his culture. To her, it is unimaginable. She feels that he must reach out to his mama to let her know how special she is to him. Will his mama's words, embrace him. Will he ever understand this "Great Love"? This is a multi-cultural tale of the two great loves in a man's life, the love of a woman and the love from his mother. Mama's Great Love takes a look at how immigrants strive to balance their lives here in the U.S. with the families they left back in their native lands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354816</url></doc>
