<plot>In Spain boys who want to become bullfighters sneak out after dark and fight imaginary bulls in the light of the moon. Today, despite the power of the animal rights movement and changes in cultural outlooks, thousands of boys still dream this dream. We join the story of one young boy, Jorge, who has this dream and has had since he was tiny, but the realities of the "sport" is that it is a hard world to get into; even with the full support of his father, who also had this dream as a child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226817</url></doc>
