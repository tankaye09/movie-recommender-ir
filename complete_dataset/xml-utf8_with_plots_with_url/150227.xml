<plot>Dr. Dilbagh is a leading Cardiologist in Bombay. He runs his own clinic as well as visits patients in Dr. Vora's Polyclinic. His secretary/receptionist is the attractive Komal, while a young and attractive patient, Rani, would like to seduce him. Add to this, he has a doting teenager named Dolly, who loves him with all her heart. Dr. Dilbagh also likes Dolly, but has unfortunately lied to her that he is already married and unhappy with his wife. His attempts to tell Dolly the truth are in vain, so he asks Komal to pose as his wife until such time he is able to win Dolly's heart. Komal agrees to do so - with hilarious results.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150227</url></doc>
