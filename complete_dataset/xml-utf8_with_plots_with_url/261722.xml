<plot>"In His Sight" follows the footsteps of Christ from birth to death and then through his resurrection. It explores those moments that may not have been recorded specifically in the Bible, as well as those handed down for centuries. Though Jesus performed many miracles in his three years of ministry, it was those he performed for children that make this movie touching and unique. Whether you believe the biblical account of Christ to be truth or fiction, everyone will be moved by compassion as a gentle Christ nurtures those in need. Laugh and cry with him as he heals a blind man, raises a girl from the dead and tells stories to children in the street. See Jesus as only a child can as he embraces the meager gift of a boy in the multitude. Experience the joy and sorrow of walking in his footsteps as he is welcomed into Jerusalem and later carries the cross through angry crowds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261722</url></doc>
