<plot>Although his mother-in-law has become exasperated by Charley's odd inventions, Charley is now trying to develop a way of making banana peels less slippery. He identifies a germ on banana peels that causes them to be slippery, and he then sets out to find a way to eliminate these germs. He has several formulas that are ready to be tried - but testing them is going to involve some hazards, both to himself and to others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357025</url></doc>
