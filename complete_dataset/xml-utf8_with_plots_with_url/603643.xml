<plot>Weekly television program formerly called, "There's Hope!" where author, pastor and teacher, Dr. Richard Lee teaches biblical principles out of God's Word. In 2007, the television program was re-vamped to "There's Hope America" where it took on a new look and feel from most religious programs. Dr. Lee offers commentary about the culture and state-of-affairs of America and the world, in his "America's Hope" segment. The program often contains a wide-range of praise and worship music including the Redeemer Choir &amp; Orchestra along with many special guests and recording artists. The program features the preaching and teaching ministry of Dr. Lee at First Redeemer Church in Cumming, Georgia, of metro-Atlanta. The program can be heard on various radio stations around the U.S. and viewed on-line through it's on-demand area of their website. First Redeemer Church services can also be seen LIVE every Sunday morning over the internet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603643</url></doc>
