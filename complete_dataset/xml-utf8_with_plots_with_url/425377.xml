<plot>As Christ comes upon the scene, He is surrounded by a large multitude of people. There appears before Him a man hobbling upon a crutch. He appeals to Jesus, who at once blesses him and the man throws away his crutch. Immediately there comes to Jesus a blind man. Christ reaches down, takes a bit of earth, spits upon it and places it upon the man's eyes. Animated dialogue ensues and the man seeing, walks away.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425377</url></doc>
