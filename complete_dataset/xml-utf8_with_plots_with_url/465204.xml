<plot>Roaring Heaven is a black comedy following a day in the life of two employees at an old people's home the day after the death of a resident. The film follows a day in the life of Katie and Aaron as they go about their work while struggling to come to terms with Mr Reed's death. The residents they speak to help them to come to terms with not just the passing but also with their own relationship. Mr Bright's apparent indifference to the news help Aaron to face up to the reality of the event while Mrs Blake's calm acceptance helps him to start getting over his friend's death. Katie struggles to relate to the residents and the event helps her to finally find a way to reach out to them and begin to form real relationships. The film traces the ways and means which different people deal with grief and Aaron and Katie's struggle to find some middle ground in the wake of their friend's death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465204</url></doc>
