<plot>In the not-too-distant future, Linda and her boyfriend Ricky enjoy a virtual-reality computer game, Bad Blood 2, that takes the player to the American West to save a town from a murderous gang. After Linda wins the final shootout, the game calls her back: Bad Dog, the gang leader, still lives. This time he gets the upper hand, and she must exit the game before her character is killed. Trouble is, the injuries she sustains in the game are now present back in reality. When she realizes that Ricky is truly dying in the game, she re-enters to try to save him. Bad Dog pursues her into the real world. Things continue to shift, and games within the game emerge. Who gets the final shot?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206500</url></doc>
