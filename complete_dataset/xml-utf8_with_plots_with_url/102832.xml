<plot>In 2001 the Victoria and Albert Museum in London hosted an exhibition by American artist Dale Chihuly. It began with the museum's decision to commission a Chandelier for the rotunda. Such an unarguably contemporary artwork at this historic museum, famous for its ties to tradition, would make just the statement the museum was looking for. Its success, combined with the huge popular interest in Chihuly's work, moved the museum to mount a major exhibition, thus fulfilling a longtime dream of Chihuly's. Shedding light on Chihuly's career, and revealing his working style, this program offers insight into what inspires this prolific artist. Vivid reportage follows from the initial development of an idea; to experimentation with new color, form and scale; to the first compositions in the studio; and finally to the installation of Chihuly's largest Chandelier. The narrative concludes with a journey through the exhibition and then outside to his installations in the Pirelli Garden.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102832</url></doc>
