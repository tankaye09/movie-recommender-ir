<plot>Mai, Pam and Jane are members of a group of 14 year old students spending a school year in remote wilderness country. Through their video diaries the girls construct frank and moving personal narratives of courage, endurance, sadness and joy. They speak not only of life at Howqua, but of their feelings, thoughts and fears relating to all aspect of their lives, including relationships and tensions within families, and between generations and cultures. Each comes to understand she alone is the author of her personal response to experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419477</url></doc>
