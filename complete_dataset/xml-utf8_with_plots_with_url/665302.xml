<plot>Kim, 32, married, part of Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption, is investigating Ho Chi; Kim goes to Shenzhen City hoping to catch Ho bribing customs officials. In Shenzhen, Kim parties with his young mistress, a call girl named Mandy, and wakes to find her dead. The mainland police lock him up without counsel. In transport, however, he manages to break free and escape to Hong Kong, where he's pursued by the implacable Officer Pai, who cares not if Kim is guilty or innocent: Pai does his duty. Now a fugitive, Kim discovers Mandy had ties to Ho. Kim, with his long-suffering wife's help and with Pai closing in, seeks proof Ho framed him. Is there any gleam of hope?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?665302</url></doc>
