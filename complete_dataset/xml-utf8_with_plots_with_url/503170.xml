<plot>June 6, 1996, A mysterious explosion destroys the Chernolton research facility near Moscow. Lucifer Alpha, a powerful biological weapon under secret development there is released into the atmosphere, creating a deadly biohazard. Carried by the trade winds, Lucifer Alpha spreads through out Eastern Europe and Eurasia, destroying 80% of the populace. Half of the world's people die.

Part organic, part machine, they're almost impossible to distinguish from those they kill. As they steal their victims' bodies in order to take their place, these mysterious invaders become known as "Snatchers."

You play the role of Gillian Seed, A rookie Junker with a lost memory and a past that is shrouded in mystery. Armed with a Blaster (the official gun of a Junker) and a robot navigator named Metal Gear, you are assigned to investigate the disappearances of Neo-Kobe citizens and put a stop to the Snatcher menace before it's to late...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503170</url></doc>
