<plot>An old [black] auntie is trying the experiment of doing two things at once with poor success. Part of her attention is engaged in manipulating a tub full of suds and soiled clothes, while with the other hand she tries to keep off what she calls a "pestiferous bee." The film ends by Auntie upsetting the tub of suds all over herself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?051437</url></doc>
