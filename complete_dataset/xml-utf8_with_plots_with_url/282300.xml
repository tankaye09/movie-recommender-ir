<plot>"Just Like Anyone" gives us a glimpse into the lives of 5 families that are doing their best to help their sons succeed, even though they are faced with severe developmental disabilities. It explores the journey that all these families have been through to get to the point to where they could first accept their sons as who they are, and then begin to work as a family to help them reach ever increasing goals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282300</url></doc>
