<plot>Meet the cast of characters of the Seven C's Bar, a kind of NEUTRAL GROUND located somewhere between East and West Los Angeles. Join Fisher, a cocky 20-something Asian American, as he drops into his favorite watering hole and pickup joint. He is welcomed by Zeke the friendly and patient Jewish bartender, and Songo, the house musician, who suffers from some kind of post-traumatic disorder. And then there is the beautiful Natalie, a comely Irish lass who captures Fisher's eye and desire. Fisher doesn't know it, but he is in for quite a night --- not quite what he imagined, but one that will teach him a hard lesson in honor, loss, and redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393581</url></doc>
