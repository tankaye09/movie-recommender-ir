<plot>Christian filmmaker Cory Parella gives an honest video commentary about the setbacks he faced in the making of this first film starting in 1995. The story covers eleven years of ambition, heartbreak, betrayal and even the closest any film has ever come to mainstream distribution without making it to stores. But the core message of his personal testimony is not to merely rant about the Arizona filmmaking community circa the mid 1990's, but to call all Christian filmmakers to a constant state of prayer and awareness that the Enemy does not want their films to be seen. It is clear that God has blessed him more than any movie career could, and his clear gratefulness for God's grace leaves viewers on a high note.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592613</url></doc>
