<plot>"One of the big 'hit' pictures of the Biograph. A pretty girl is seated on a plank over the water by the side of a large Gordon setter which she is petting and which seems to enjoy the proceedings. Thinking to frighten the dog the girl starts to bounce up and down the plank. As she does so the plank breaks, and the two are precipitated into the water; the dog striking out for land, and the girl clinging to the boards until help arrives."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362717</url></doc>
