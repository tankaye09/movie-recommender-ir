<plot>Taken at Bliss, Oklahoma. Shows a typical Western stage hold-up. A band of robbers are playing cards in the foreground of the picture. Suddenly one of the gang who has been on the lookout for the stage coach rides up in great haste. They quickly dodge behind a clump of trees and lay in wait. Soon the coach appears and is stopped by the bandits. The occupants are compelled to come down from their hiding places at the point of the gun and after being relieved of their valuables, are allowed to continue on their way. As soon as the stage drives off the robbers make for their ponies and take to the woods.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651044</url></doc>
