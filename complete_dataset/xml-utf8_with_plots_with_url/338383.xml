<plot>Little People Matt and Amy Roloff may only be four feet tall, but they are determined to make the world their own. Raising four children - a mixture of Little and average size-siblings - the Roloffs strain under emotional and financial burdens. Laid-off for over a year, Matt struggles to get a new business off the ground, and Amy grows resentful when she is forced to go back to work for the first time in 14 years. The Roloff's son Zach learns painful lessons about life as a Little Person when, for the first time, he's too small and too slow to make the soccer team, and average-size kids gang up on him at his 14th birthday party.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338383</url></doc>
