<plot>Brakhage's hand carvings directly into the film emulsions are illuminated and textured by Solomon's lighting and optical printing. The forms are then shaped and edited by Solomon into a Dance of Seasons, a Hymn to the Sun, from Summer to Spring, inspired by the woodcuts of Japanese artists Hokusai and Hiroshige and Anton Webern's orchestral coloration of Ricecar from The Musical Offering. The continuity of line and rhythm over the ever-changing colors and textures of the yearly cycle is akin to a continuous melodic development with changes in timbre and overtones. Seasons... Is a subset of Brakhage's larger, umbrella work title "..." (Ellipsis).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483131</url></doc>
