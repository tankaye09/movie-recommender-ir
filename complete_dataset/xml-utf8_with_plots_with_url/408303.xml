<plot>Bed room scene. A woman is asleep in folding bed. Husband, who is very drunk, opens the door cautiously, enters with shoes in hand, and proceeds to undress in an uncertain manner. He takes a drink from the water pitcher and drops it on the floor. This awakens his wife, who gives him a curtain lecture. He tries to make her keep quiet by squirting seltzer in her face, which only makes her more violent. Growing desperate, he closes her up in the folding bed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408303</url></doc>
