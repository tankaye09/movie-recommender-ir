<plot>In this picture we show President Roosevelt and Cabinet standing at the station with bare heads, while the casket of President McKinley is being placed in the hearse. As the hearse leaves the station the President and his Cabinet start for their carriages. Our panoramic device is here started and this picture finishes with a circular panoramic of the Canton station and Public Square. The picture here presented of President Roosevelt is the best one ever recorded. He is very close to the camera and shown life size and can be instantly recognized.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442819</url></doc>
