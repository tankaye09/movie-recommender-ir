<plot>Bertha Means grew up picking cotton in Depression-era Texas, but she was determined to get an education. Her mother taught her from textbooks while she worked in the fields each fall. She attended high school and, later, Huston-Tillotson University. In 1962, her Mothers' Action Council helped end segregation in Austin, Texas. Flash to 2008. Bertha Means is 88 years old, and selected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. In the moments of this historic election year, she offers an inspiring glimpse into what it's like to witness (and make) great change over a lifetime.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222331</url></doc>
