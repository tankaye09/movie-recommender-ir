<plot>Each Malangatana's brushstroke is a new line of a long life story. Odd black and white sketching, full of little people in the middle of animals, or with such an explosive African color, that describes the painter memories. Starring at the drawings he says "one day I will explain all this". Throughout is living memories and these promises we are taken on a journey into the African world. We see the relation between the present and the past along with the spirits, how they are connected in an emotional way, how they integrate themselves, having to assimilate another culture in colonial time. Malangatana is one of the most important painters of the African Continent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394901</url></doc>
