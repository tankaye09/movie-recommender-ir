<plot>Here we show dog teams, sleds, school children, miners, prospectors, sports, camp followers and loafers on McKinlet Street, Valdez. The snow has just become packed, and the men with their dog teams, and their "best girls" turn out in numbers, while those not so fortunate as to have "best girls" in that far north, take their amusement in the form of pelting each other with snowballs. Finely illustrative of one phase of life in the Northwest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196083</url></doc>
