<plot>Two brothers, demons to be exact, both work in the same company. The elder brother is a chief executive in The Firm, more polished &amp; experienced. While the younger brother is a new recruit, being more inexperienced and wet-behind-the-ears in the manners and tactics of the 'enemy'. The younger has asked the elder to sit down with him in a cafe; to discuss the present condition of one of his patients who has been very difficult to crush. The elder brother has something to say about this indeed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084358</url></doc>
