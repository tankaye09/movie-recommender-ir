<plot>In the Angeles National Forest, a woman by the side of the road asks a man who's parked nearby to give her a ride for just a couple of miles. He's reluctant, but finally agrees. He's with his dog, Millie. She chats, controlling the conversation. He's wearing rubber gloves and has recently lost his job. She bucks him up, then tells him that she's hijacking his car and she's taking Millie. He loses it and begins to drive recklessly. Will he kill them all, will she relent and not take Millie? The radio reports a kidnapping.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318777</url></doc>
