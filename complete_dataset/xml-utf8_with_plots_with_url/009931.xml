<plot>This film is about providing safe water for the people of Cambodia, who lost everything to mass genocide: their doctors, lawyers, schools, religion, and most importantly their way of life. Over the last two years, fifteen wells have been built with the help of Sambrothers.org. In 2009 the effects of the wells have had on the lives of the people are seen. By telling this story, some of the complexities and challenges involved in giving are revealed. Although this story is a drop in the bucket, it is one filled with possibility, opportunity, and promise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009931</url></doc>
