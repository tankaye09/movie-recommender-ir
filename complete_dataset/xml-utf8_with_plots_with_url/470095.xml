<plot>Rue the Day is a taut eighteen minutes in the lives of three young women, and poses the question: If you could bury the past to prevent the future, would you have the courage? The film, written in 2004 and completed in 2005, anticipated a topic all too familiar to Canadians and Americans of late - the balance between justice and morality. With a female serial rapist and murderer released on parole, how far would you go to right a wrong and protect society? The director, Miriam Laurence, is disturbed by the increasing number of criminals plea-bargaining for release from jail, after committing crimes against children. She feels that this trend is unconscionable and unacceptable to concerned families in both Canada and the United States. The plot revolves around three cousins, a recently paroled killer of young women, one rock garden and one secret. In the end, the audience is left to their own interpretation--was the parolee made to 'rue the day' she committed her crimes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470095</url></doc>
