<plot>Geeks is a film that deals with why people become interested with certain things in life and how they should be allowed their interests without being labeled because of it. .The film concentrates on 4 areas of interest that these so-called geeks have: Japanese Anime, Star Wars, Star Trek and the film The Nightmare Before Christmas. I have interviewed 24 of the actors and creators of these films along with fans of all four genres.Some of the participants are from Star Trek: Ethan Phillips, Tim Russ and Robert Beltran. From Nightmare: Chris Sarandon, Glenn Shadix, and Ken Page.From Star Wars: David Prowse, Frank Oz,and Irvin Kershner. From Anime John Ratzenberger, David Ogden Stiers, and Mike Yuen.Also Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson from American Idol. In addition interviews with fans at various conventions. This is a film that has humanity, humor and style.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?211221</url></doc>
