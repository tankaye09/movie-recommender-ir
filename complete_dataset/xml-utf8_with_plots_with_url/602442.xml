<plot>This is certainly a screamer. While Mrs. Newlywed steps out of the dining room her husband takes advantage of the opportunity to make love to the pretty maid. Mrs. Newlywed returns in time to catch the couple, and the gay husband gets his deserts. He is chased about the room, followed by flying crockery, and when he finally falls over a chair his wife jumps on him and beats his head against the floor with such violence that it seems as if his brains would be beaten out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602442</url></doc>
