<plot>Sacrifice tells the struggles of an immigrant Guyanese family living in Queens, NY. The parents and children struggle to adapt to American culture while still maintaining their Guyanese roots. Ammirita Singh, an aspiring dancer, falls in love with her older brothers' best friend, Shawn Jagdeo. Shawn and Ammirita keep their love secret because Ammi's family would not approve. Her older brother, Ramjit Singh, is a college dropout who lost the love of his life and was never able to recover. He turns to drinking as a solution to his problems. Their parents, Jai and Indra Singh, barely speak to each other and when they do it usually ends in a fight. With all of their problems, they come to realize that in this world family is all you have. Other people come and go, but family is there for life. Sacrifices are made for tradition, for love, and above all else, for family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473206</url></doc>
