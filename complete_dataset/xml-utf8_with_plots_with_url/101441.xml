<plot>The story of the battle for cheese production dominance between California and Wisconsin. "Cheese Wars" is a short documentary film that travels to both Wisconsin and California to look at how the dairy and cheese industries are evolving in both states. The culture of the two states, different cow herd sizes and the remarkable marketing campaign of 'Happy Cows' has turned this race for cheese dominance into a humorous battle, and one that will test the lifeblood of the former Dairy state - Wisconsin.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101441</url></doc>
