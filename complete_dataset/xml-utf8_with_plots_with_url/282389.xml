<plot>A Jamaican man sits in his back yard in England watching test cricket live on tv. He laughs to himself when he sees a pigeon by the wicket being chased off by the bowler. However what he doesn't see is that the pigeon has been inspired by being bowled out and decides to get other birds together and have a game themselves in the man's back garden.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282389</url></doc>
