<plot>Probably the most daring and plucky trip yet undertaken by the automobile fraternity was begun in May, 1902 when Dr. Lehwis, the automobile expert of Paris, left London in his specially constructed car "The Passe Partout" on his trip around the world. We show the passengers embarking in the car, and the start, also a breakdown and the repairing of one of the pneumatic tires. A most pleasing subject, and one that will prove especially valuable as Dr. Lehwis passes through the different sections where the film is to be shown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158564</url></doc>
