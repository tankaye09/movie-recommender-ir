<plot>The myth of Joan of Arc has fascinated people the world over. In the collective memory, she is the young shepherd girl who died at the stake having saved France. But 15th century chronicles report that following events in Rouen, certain people refused to believe she was dead and that another woman was burned instead. Five years after the stake, an astonishing rumour began to circulate - the "Pucelle" was back ! So extraordinary it has become enigmatic, the story of Joan of Arc has been revisited by Martin Meissonnier, who leads us on a detailed and fascinating enquiry. Based on numerous unquestionable archive documents, he blends historical thoroughness with a highly entertaining approach using reconstructions in period clothing and film excerpts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?644153</url></doc>
