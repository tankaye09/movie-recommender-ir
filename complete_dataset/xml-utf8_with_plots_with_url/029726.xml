The Kid, unknown to John by sight, is on a ranch which he hopes to gain legal possession of as it has oil. It is really John's by right, which he does not know until informed by his sweetheart, Joan Vallon (Roberta Gale.)

John is in the courtroom when the Kid makes his claim, but his protest is overruled and he is arrested on suspicion of having killed Marshal Bly.
