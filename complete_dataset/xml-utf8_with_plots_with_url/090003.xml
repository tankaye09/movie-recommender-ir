<plot>In order to make a quick buck, a wisecracking surfer girl reluctantly gets involved in a scam to transport Californian weed across state lines. She gets way more than she bargained for when a freak surfing accident sets of a chain of bizarre and dangerous events. In no time she finds herself framed for multiple gangland murders and on the run from the Mexican mob, the corrupt police and the media spotlight. Easy money never is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090003</url></doc>
