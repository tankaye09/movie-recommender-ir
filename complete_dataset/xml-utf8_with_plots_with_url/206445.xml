<plot>Jamie is a young man who suffers from both anorexia and bulimia. His memories of being teased for being over-weight coupled with people's treatment of his sudden weight loss lead him to question his decisions for the first time. We are allowed into his reality and given insight into his perspective as he holds everyone at a distance while he examines the details of his disillusioned world. And this allows him to see just how paper thin the reality he has been living in truly is. "Full" is not about overcoming an eating disorder; it is about understanding an eating disorder, and how a young man comes to understand it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206445</url></doc>
