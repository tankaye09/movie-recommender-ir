<plot>"The Old Car" is about how a seemingly simple, mundane object can make us travel back in time, reliving our memories as if we had stepped out of a time machine. It is a drama-comedy about Charles, a middle-aged man, who sees his first owned car parked on the street. Eager to reconnect with his youth, he strives to sit in the car. However, he has to persuade the current owner of the car, the twenty-something-year-old Alyssa, for permission first.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580057</url></doc>
