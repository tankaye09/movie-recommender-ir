<plot>This is a documentary that deals with the experiences of individuals of both Japanese and African American descent living in Georgia. They live in African American communities. However, because of their dual backgrounds, their ethnic identity is a major issue. They want to identify themselves as African American, but their African America friends sometimes do not consider them as African Americans. They overcome their issues and start to take pride in who they are. This documentary raises the social awareness of biracial and bi-cultural individuals and encourages those people to be themselves. Also, it urges the audience to accept different cultures, different races, and different ethnicities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417704</url></doc>
