<plot>What if the wrong people decided to make a reality television show? What if one of them was truly evil? Can three innocent, kidnapped women escape with their lives? Four days after the first abduction we watch a young woman, Gail, being kidnapped. She wakes, in a hut with two other women, wearing a special collar - one that will kill her if she tires to remove it, and shock her if she tries to escape. Enter the kidnapper Stevie. Stevie is making a television show: 'How to Marry a Mountain Man.' Gail realizes he is not all there in the head, and he is certainly not smart enough to plan this. When Stevie leaves the women attempt an escape. As Margo tries to enter a pond to short out the collar, an unseen gunman prepares to shoot her. Only the arrival of Stevie prevents Margo's death. When Stevie leaves to kidnap a final contestant the women try again. Carrying the collars' broadcast tower with them in a wheelbarrow, they get a good distance away before they see Stevie coming back. They hide the wheelbarrow and broadcast tower and run back to their prison. Stevie drives up but never brings the new girl in. The next morning the girls discover the new girl dead behind Stevie's cabin with a very upset Stevie watching over her. The girls run for it, but are soon pursued by the hidden gunman - a man much more dangerous than Stevie - and a skilled hunter killer. Can they escape?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294556</url></doc>
