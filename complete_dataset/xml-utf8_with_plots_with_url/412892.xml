<plot>The physical and mental devastation of lifelong alcohol abuse affects not only the drinker but also his or her friends and family. Medical experts outline the physiological effects of long-term addiction, while celebrities such as Chuck Norris, Suzanne Somers, Carol Burnett and Doc Severinsen (himself a recovering alcoholic) describe how life with a heavy drinker has impacted their lives. Also covered is the long road to rehabilitation that an abuser must undergo to survive. Using interviews, dramatizations and documentary footage, One For The Road frankly depicts the ravages of excessive drinking and its aftermath.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412892</url></doc>
