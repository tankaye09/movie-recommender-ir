<plot>There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was either produced or distributed by Lubin at this time. It's not the same film as The Sheep Herder (1914), which is a Victor production. Most likely, either the film was announced but never made, begun but never completed, or else completed but released under another title, unidentifiable at this time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?590255</url></doc>
