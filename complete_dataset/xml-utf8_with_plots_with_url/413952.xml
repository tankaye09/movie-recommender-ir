<plot>Thakur Vikram Singh, while driving home in his chauffeur-driven car, loses control, and crashes it in a building, instantly killing a woman. Vikram finds out that the woman had a young son, Raju, and decides to adopt him to atone for this crime. He takes him home with him, but Vikram's snobbish and arrogant son, Maan Singh, does not take kindly to this intrusion. Vikram decides to send him away to a hostel so that he can learn to get along with everyone. Shortly after that, Vikram passes away, his estate is taken over by his brother, Pratap, and Maan is allowed to return home. The first thing Maan does is to get Raju out of the house into their stables, and Pratap brands him with the letter "M" on his back. Years later, Raju is still working in the stables, is in love with Maan's sister, Poonam, and hopes for better times. When Maan finds out that Raju is in love with Poonam, he has him severely beaten, and left for dead, and arranges his sister's marriage with Yuvraj Singh. Years later, a man named Rai Bahadur Rajdev Singh enters the Singhs' lives. Maan suspects that it is none other than Raju, only to find out that he has no scar or any marking on his back. It is then that Maan finds out that his dad did not die but was killed. Maan swears to avenge his father's death, but does not realize that he may not even have a roof on his head as he has lost everything in a horse race to Rajdev. The questions remain, who killed Vikram; who exactly is Rajdev; and did Poonam marry Yuvraj Singh?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413952</url></doc>
