<plot>John Connolly and James "Whitey" Bulger both grew up on the streets of South Boston. Decades later, in the mid 1970's, they would meet again. By then, Connolly was a major figure in the FBI's Boston office and Whitey had become godfather of the Irish Mob. What happened next - a dirty deal to being down the Italian mob in exchange for protection for Bulger - would spiral out of control, leading to murders, drug dealing, racketeering indictments, and, ultimately, the biggest informant scandal in the history of the FBI. Black Mass is at once a riveting crime story, a cautionary tale about the abuse of power, and a penetrating look at Boston and its Irish population.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073254</url></doc>
