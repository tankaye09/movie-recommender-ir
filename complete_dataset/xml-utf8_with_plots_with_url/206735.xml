<plot>One of our funniest pictures is this. It shows two Chinamen sitting on the floor "hitting the pipe." Presently they repair to their bunks which are placed one over the other. The chink in the upper berth has a long pigtail which hangs down within easy reach of the one in the lower berth, who pulls it occasionally, much to the discomfort of his companion, who is trying to dream. He takes his cue and tickles the other with it until in a moment of excitement they roll out on the floor, the one in the upper berth falling prone on the ground from his high perch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206735</url></doc>
