<plot>A French bush pilot and a German globetrotter. They're both friends, although they're very different from each other. They're both loners. And both have retired to a life of seclusion on the banks of the Rio Verde. One has forged a new identity for himself in order to start a new life and to forget his past. The other passes himself off as an honorary consul, and he savours all that life has to offer. They both have one characteristic in common, however - they keep getting mixed up in new adventures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329985</url></doc>
