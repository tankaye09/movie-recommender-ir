<plot>Anna is followed everywhere she goes by a creepy pale assailant with a knife. She doesn't seem to be very afraid. She marches coldly through her day, ignoring him, going about her business. Her stalker looks threatening but his manner seems to suggest that he is just a confused social outcast, trapped in an obsessive, repetitive rut that revolves around Anna. It becomes clear that the line between assailant and victim has begun to break down and that the roles in this relationship are now unclear. Anna has begun to rely on her stalker's presence. She even allows him to carry her groceries. Is the albino stalking her or watching over her? Anna obtains a retraining order against her stalker but she still worries about him, huddled outside her home on a cold, windy night. Neither of them seem able to disrupt or end their oddly comforting, creepy codependent relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041373</url></doc>
