<plot>This is a comedy about being dumped. Sandra's boyfriend's gone up north for a job so she's putting together a care package for him and making a video letter to send with it. Everything in the video short is Sandra addressing the camera for this "letter." After she puts everything into the package, she holds up the love letter he left for her that she's been saving to read on camera. As she reads, she's devastated to see that it's actually a "Dear Jane" letter. He's banging their neighbor in Vegas. First comes shock, then denial and we watch as Sandra goes through the seven stages of grief dealing with being dumped: shock, denial, bargaining, anger, depression and acceptance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476446</url></doc>
