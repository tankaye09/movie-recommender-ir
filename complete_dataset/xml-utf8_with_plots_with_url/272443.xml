<plot>The film opens in a bar with Jacques smoking a cigarette, telling us all of the things he loves about smoking. We are then introduced to his girlfriend who sits across from him at a restaurant. She embodies everything a woman should be; smart, pretty, and always put together. And yet, she is nothing that Jacques wants. His next girlfriend is beautiful, loves sex and smokes a lot. The two hit it off instantly and have such a mutual connection that they don't even need to speak to one another to communicate. However, he does not love her either. There is only one woman who has his heart. She is the woman he will always want, but never have. Over the course of the film, we come to realize that no matter what we do to mask the pain, or how much we try to forget about the past, everything always comes down to love, and the search for it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272443</url></doc>
