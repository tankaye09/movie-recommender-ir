<plot>Shows the moon rising above the trees and Weary Willie approaching a bench. After yawning and stretching he lies down to sleep. He begins a dream. The scene changes to the back door of a farm house. Weary Willie enters the gate and knocks on the kitchen door and asks the lady of the house for something to eat. The house dog is turned loose and Weary Willie is grabbed by the slack of his trousers. Dog and tramp roll over and over upon the ground in a terrible struggle. The scene now instantly changes to the bench in the park and shows Weary Willie awakening. A big policeman is standing over him pounding his feet with his club, which puts an end to his nightmare.
