<plot>Mafia boss Angelo prays in Church and his priest urges him to unburden himself of his sins. Angelo explains how a prostitute from the neighborhood solicited him, and at first he turned down her offer until an unusual event happened causing him to give in. Angelo figures since he is a paying customer, he might as well do some stuff with her that his wife will not do for him at home. Angelo attempts to push the prostitute beyond her boundaries, and she becomes uncomfortable and a struggle ensues. Angelo ultimately admits to losing control and killing the prostitute, but the priest sees that he is remorseful and gives him a very light penance until Angelo admits to doing the one thing that can not be condoned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246838</url></doc>
