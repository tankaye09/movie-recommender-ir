<plot>"Two Summer girls have taken a city chap out for a row. He is immacuately attired. As they approach the boat landing the girls ask the young man to jump ashore with the rope. He does so, but slips on the landing and falls into the water, from which they rescue him with shouts of laughter."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014730</url></doc>
