<plot>Flip is a dentist. A walrus in the waiting room is apprehensive when he hears the screams of earlier patients, but he is wrestled into the chair. Flip tries to pull the bad tooth, but keeps getting laundry, small cars, etc. He drills, but the bit breaks. Finally, he uses gas (a skunk) to put the walrus out. The walrus comes to just in time to find that Flip has put a lit stick of dynamite in his mouth; walrus removes his dentures and the dynamite, and puts them under Flip. The whole office blows sky high.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321266</url></doc>
