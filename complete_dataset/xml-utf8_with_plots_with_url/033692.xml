<plot>Madhusudan Chaudhary lives in a small fishing village in West Bengal, India, along with his wealthy but aging paternal uncle, who trusts him and lets him handle their estate and business. Madhusudan is in love with Dr. Anand's sister, Rekha, and everyone expects them to get married soon. Madhusudan's vices are drinking and having a good time, and this is what is held against him when a woman named Champa confides in Rekha that he had been intimate with her and as a result got her pregnant. Rekha confronts Madhusudan, but he denies everything, however, Rekha disbelieves him. Angry, he goes in search of Champa, only to find out that she is not to be found anywhere in the village. Before he could find her, he is arrested by the Police on a charge of stealing money from his uncle, found guilty, and sent to jail for several years. After his discharge, he returns home to find his uncle is dead; an employee, Maheem Ghosal has taken over the estate and the property; Champa is missing; and Rekha hates him. Unable to reconcile himself to the changed circumstances, he takes to alcohol in a big way and lives the life of a half-man half-beast, feared and hated at the same time by all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033692</url></doc>
