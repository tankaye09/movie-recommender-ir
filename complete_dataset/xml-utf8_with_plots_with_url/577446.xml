<plot>Emily has just awoken to discover that the night before contained more than just a half bottle of Absinth... It did in fact - also contain a rubber gas-mask and a pair of studded gauntlets. Armed with little other than a box of dental floss, a packet of shaving razors and half a tube of super-glue, Emily must now cut through her arm in order to escape the men she can't believe she just slept with. Self mutilation has never been so much fun in this insanely violent and bloody comedy. It's slick, it's sick, and it's ever so twisted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577446</url></doc>
