<plot>In 1963, from a small field on Haskels Rascals Ranch, L.A., an event known as the "Renaissance Pleasure Faire" was born. Blossoming from the Faire: street performing, arts, crafts, living history scenarios were all given new life. Some 45 years later, Faire as it is so affectionately known, touches the lives of millions of people a year. From a school yard fund-raiser, Ron and Phylis Patterson took a weekend event and turned it into a worldwide phenomenon. Struggling to redefine itself , the Faire is now competing with the World Wide Web, Global Economies and Burning Man. Follow the incredible journey of a group of people that defined a movement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187801</url></doc>
