<plot>The Quiz Kids, a Blue Network Wednesday night radio program, sponsored by Alka-Seltzer, came to the screen in 1941 as a series of shorts produced by Paramount. Joe Kelly, the quiz master who asked the questions answered by these kids with IQ's ranging from average to above 200, was a veteran of WLS (Chicago) station's The National Barn Dance and a third-grade drop-out who made no pretense of knowing the answers without peeking. The radio program also evolved into a TV series, though all of the original radio Quiz Kids had long-ago graduated or aged themselves off of the program.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585055</url></doc>
