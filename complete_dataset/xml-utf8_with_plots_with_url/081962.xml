<plot>In 1960, Vitomir Bezjak graduated from the Music Academy in Zagreb as an honor student. Now, he is looking for a job, lives like a bohemian and works on his musical pieces. In spite of the fact that he is the recipient of much praise, no one wants to hire him. Moreover, his girlfriend leaves him and, disappointed, he accepts a job as a piano teacher. He soon falls in love with a rich widow, whose son he teaches. The boy's grandfather throws a big wedding party for the new couple, introducing Vitomir to many influential people. The young man's life changes radically: he becomes famous, attending political meetings and big receptions. Everyone expects a masterpiece from him, but he is no longer the talented young composer he used to be. Finally, after he finishes his magnum opus, one of the orchestra members accuses him of plagiarism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081962</url></doc>
