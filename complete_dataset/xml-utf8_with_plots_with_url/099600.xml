<plot>The author travels back from Italy to America where he moved to at the age of 12 and lived until he was 18. These crucial years of his life spent in Los Angeles have forever shaped his persona and created a strong identity crisis within him. He decides to deal with his past by embarking in a journey across the United States during the 40 days prior to America's most crucial and heartfelt elections: Obama vs McCain. Change is an inside look at the political rallies, the concerts, the events, the controversies, the hopes and fears of a struggling country through the lens of a man looking to find himself and the country that raised him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099600</url></doc>
