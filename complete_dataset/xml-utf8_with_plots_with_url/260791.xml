<plot>This magnificently madcap comedy classic stars Egyptian film legends Tahiya Karioka and Emad Hamdi as Zeinab and Hussein, overworked parents who get little relief from the never ending demands of their seven mischievous children. When their eldest daughter, Ahlam, meets a dashing young man at a party, it's love at first sight and wedding plans must quickly be arranged. As preparations get underway, Zeinab and Hussein are soon overwhelmed by the elaborate and costly requests made by the groom's extravagant family. While tending to the needs of their other six children, Hussein and Zeinab must consider unconventional means to obtain the funds for a ceremony that the newlyweds will be proud of. Filled with entertaining turns by a colorful cast of characters, MOTHER OF THE BRIDE explores Egyptian courtship and marriage customs of the 1960s while relaying a delightfully entertaining story the entire family will enjoy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260791</url></doc>
