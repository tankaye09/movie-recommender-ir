<plot>Oxford professor of history qv##nm1675020## wrote a biography of Alexander the Great in 1973. Many Hollywood producers read it and tried to make a film about Alexander. The one who actually managed it was qv##nm0000231##. Stone called upon Lane Fox to ask him various questions and eventually to use him as a historical advisor on his film. As soon as Robin heard that the film was to be a major epic and would include a large cavalry charge Robin knew what his price would be for the advice he gave - he wanted to be in the first 15 of the cavalry charge. A keen horseman, he was more used to riding to hounds in the Oxfordshire countryside but Robin went to Morocco where the film crew was filming the location shots. A documentary crew from BBC Four followed him and we see a man given an unexpected opportunity to make his dream come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100093</url></doc>
