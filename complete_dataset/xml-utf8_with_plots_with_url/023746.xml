<plot>Into an empty movie theater comes a single spectator, a box of popcorn in hand. He tries various seats before settling down near the front. The movie starts. In comes a couple who sit down right next to the chap with the popcorn, even though every other seat in the theater is empty. They begin making out noisily, and soon they're hard at raw sex. Our lad averts his eyes and resorts to a homemade earplug. Does our hero have any other recourse? Should he get the usher? After the show, he visits the gents, but he's not alone for long.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023746</url></doc>
