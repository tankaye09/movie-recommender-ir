<plot>A team of experts is summoned to the vast mountains of San Luis in Argentina, to map an abandoned tungsten mine. As soon as they arrive, the Team has to face local superstition, as legend surrounds the forgotten tunnels... but they find that someone may be using that legend to hide his personal interests. Determined to do their job, the Team explores the claustrophobic underworld of the mine, only to come face to face with an old secret, a secret so horrible that compromises not only the Town Mayor, but the very people they have trusted; a secret that should have stayed buried forever, a secret that starts to take their lives, one by one... ... and that will make them face their own, personal terrors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555558</url></doc>
