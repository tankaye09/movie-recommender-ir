<plot>Animals are always interesting to look upon, especially those which are not seen daily. Here we show the American Eagle, the long-necked Giraffe, the Zebra, and a number of others, including the Ostrich, all moving about, making an animated picture throughout. You will interest the little ones with this film. Short lengths will be made if desired.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017890</url></doc>
