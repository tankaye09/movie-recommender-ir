<plot>RAISED IN THE RING tells the story of two 8-year-old-girls, both professional Muay Thai prizefighters. Set in two small villages in rural Thailand, the film chronicles the girls' emotional, sometimes heartbreaking journey as they struggle to help provide for their families. We live with each girl for two years as each transforms from child, sister, friend and student into fierce fighters with rigorous training schedules, a long list of fights, and one goal: To win their families a better life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454202</url></doc>
