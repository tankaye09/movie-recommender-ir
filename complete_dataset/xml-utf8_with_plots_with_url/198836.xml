<plot>"Fold" is the story of JJ, an unrepentant card shark. In the midst of his latest con, he meets The Doll, a beautiful, mysterious jazz singer. It is only a matter of time before the two have fallen in love, and JJ invites The Doll to travel to California with him once he has swindled a rich mafia boss. Now motivated by love and money, JJ dives head first into a dangerous card game, with disastrous results. With no one else to turn to, JJ asks for help from the only person he has ever learned to trust: The Doll. The Doll must decide if she will join the fleeing JJ or desert him with the mob hot on his trail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198836</url></doc>
