<plot>Paul is about to face a life changing event. He drinks too much, lost his girl and now a mysterious 'foe' has invaded his life. The worst part is that the intruder seems to be in Paul's mind. Paul believes the intruder is not real, but this dark stranger torments Paul nonetheless. He feels that he is losing his mind. When the stranger asks Paul to question his own reality, Paul snaps, unleashing his pent up wrath in a sudden violent rage. The release ends in despair and confusion, as the stranger has vanished. When a man who resembles Paul's 'foe' comes to the door, Paul is determined to take one final action to rid himself of this haunt.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198755</url></doc>
