<plot>Something new in boxing. An Englishman and a Frenchman come together, and as the Englishman lands hard on the Frenchman's jaw, the Frenchman goes to the floor on his hands, and lands with both feet on the Englishman's solar plexus. The Frenchman fights with hands and feet, and it is with difficulty the Englishman can ward off all the blows. Very unique and interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178815</url></doc>
