<plot>A dark-sheep type of man returns to his hometown after a prolonged absence. While he's been gone ludicrous rumours have spread about his whereabouts. Is he a big footy player or is he a film star. Turns out he's still the same lovable but not likable sort of fellow he was when he left. He wants his old girlfriend back even though she is married to his brother now and is pregnant. For money he nets in mullets (hence his nickname, Mullet) but no'one wants to buy them. People begin to get sick of him being back again and become hostile, telling him to leave again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381243</url></doc>
