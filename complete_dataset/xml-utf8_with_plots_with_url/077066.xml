<plot>The informative and insightful Christian talk show host you thought couldn't exist, Bob Enyart has been debating guests and callers for over 15 years. His confrontational approach intrigues those who think that Christian talk shows only want money or are unrealistically "nice." No topic too sensitive, Bob describes himself best: "America's most popular, self-proclaimed, right-wing religious fanatic, homophobic, anti-choice talk show host." The show takes a biblical approach to current events with startling clarity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077066</url></doc>
