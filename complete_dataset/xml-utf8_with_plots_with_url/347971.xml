<plot>Pickpocket Jo達o meets would-be mercenary Pedro, on his way to Africa. After a brawl in which Pedro is knocked unconscious, Jo達o returns him to his arid homeland on the border between Portugal and Spain, about to be submerged beneath the waters of a giant hydro-electric dam. Pedro attempts to flee, but encounters Clara - the beautiful wife of a local landowner and accepts a job to work on the land. Pedro and Jo達o are both attracted to Clara and a dark love triangle unfolds between them, building towards a surprising ending of sacrifice and passion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?347971</url></doc>
