<plot>In the Chicago stockyards, the gates of a pen of long-horn cattle are open and the cattle are being herded out by several cowhands, at least two of whom have poles to keep the steers moving in the right direction. The cattle come toward the stationary camera, which is mounted above their path. They proceed under, toward a destination we do not see. There are probably 50 head in the lot. When the last has left, a solitary cowhand surveys the empty pen. Over the fence behind him stand two other cowboys.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096921</url></doc>
