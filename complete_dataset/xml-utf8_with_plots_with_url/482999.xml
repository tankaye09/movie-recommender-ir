<plot>Filmmaker Angela Shelton journeys across the United States meeting other Angela Sheltons in an effort to survey women in America. She discovers that 24 out of 40 Angela Sheltons have been abused just like herself. Then the filmmaker meets an Angela Shelton who tracks sexual predators and lives in the same town as the filmmaker's father who molested her and her stepsiblings for years. The filmmaker's survey of women becomes a journey of self discovery during which she decides to finally confront her past and her own father - on Father's Day. The Angela Sheltons complete the journey by teaching the filmmaker about forgiveness, faith and the power of the human spirit, no matter what your name is. In all probability, you know someone who was abused, if you think not, meet the Angela Sheltons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482999</url></doc>
