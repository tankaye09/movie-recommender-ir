<plot>The primary focus of A Culture Trek is the Gurung people of the Annapurna Sanctuary and their culture. Several aspects of the Gurung people's lives are examined. These aspects include customs, culture, cooking, lifestyle, friendship, work ethic and dress. A Culture Trek also provides a glimpse into the beauty of the region. This journey chronicles Jacob Bond's (Canadian) trek through the beautiful and vast Annapurna range in Nepal with his guide Prabin Dhaungana (Nepali). Trekking during the monsoon season, Jacob and Prabin enjoy the views of the amazing vistas and the interaction with the area's Gurung inhabitants. While the initial motivation for documenting this trek is to highlight the lofty destination known as Annapurna Base Camp, the viewer will find that the journey through the region is equally, if not more, enlightening. Viewers will be informed and entertained while delving into the remote region known as the Annapurna Sanctuary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009079</url></doc>
