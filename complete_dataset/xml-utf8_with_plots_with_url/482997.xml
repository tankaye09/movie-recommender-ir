<plot>Despite living in one of the gay capitals of the world, 28-year-old Sydneysider Poppy Stockell is forced online in her search for love. When she meets 31-year-old Anglo-Indian Sandeep Virdi, she thinks she's found the one. Unfortunately, Sandeep lives at home in the British Midlands with her conservative Sikh parents and three younger sisters. Oh, and she's not out to any of them... Through raw, incredibly frank footage, Searching 4 Sandeep follows Poppy and Sandeep's tumultuous relationship across two years and three continents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482997</url></doc>
