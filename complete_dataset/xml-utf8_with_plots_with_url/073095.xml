<plot>A young boy named Jack Sawyer traveled through a parallel universe to save his mother and her "twinner" Queen Laura Deloessian. Twenty years later, now a retired homicide officer and with little memory of his adventure, a series of murders start to pile up and the memories slowly start to come back, pointing to a killer dubbed the "Fisherman" who also travels between this world and that. Jack allows himself to be drawn into the investigation as he is the only person with the tools and experience to catch such an elusive killer. In doing so, Jack risks his own life as well as the lives of his friends on saving one victim, who if in the wrong hands, could destroy not only this world but all of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073095</url></doc>
