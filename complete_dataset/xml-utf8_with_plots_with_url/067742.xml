<plot>What are the essential ingredients in the development of young pianists? Certainly, love of music and a combination of skill and study are essential. But the pianists who become concert artists share an additional quality. For these performers, once on stage, a switch flips on, propelling them to soar beyond what they can do in the rehearsal hall. "Beyond the Practice Room" will take a close look at this "switch" to see what motivates young pianists to perform and to take risks on stage, to experiment as artists. Parental influence, passion for music, dreams and expectations are among the many themes that we will explore in this intimate, behind-the-scenes portrait of the contestants at the New York Piano Competition</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067742</url></doc>
