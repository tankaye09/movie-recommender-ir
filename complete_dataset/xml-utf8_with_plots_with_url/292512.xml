<plot>Claire is locked in her room by her over-zealous mother for reading the Marquis De Sade's 120 Days Of Sodom. Fearful of the bad influences to which her daughter might be exposed she enlists the help of a young priest, Father Joshua, to offer her religious instruction. However the earnest and straight-laced priest soon finds himself questioning his vows. One night Claire is awoken by a mysterious woman who tunnels into her room from the mine beneath Claire's house. She liberates Claire from the oppressive atmosphere of her home. Retaining a similar aesthetic to Downey's previous film, Paranoia, King For A Day follows its own gently idiosyncratic logic, seeming to exist on some dreamlike hinterland, but this time brings a sly and anarchic sense of humour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292512</url></doc>
