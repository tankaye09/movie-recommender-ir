<plot>Every August, over half a million people flock to Edmonton's Old Strathcona District to watch world-class performers mount both new and classic stage works in this 25 year-old theater festival, which was inspired by the original Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland. Many actors who began their careers at the Fringe have gone on to star in theater, television and movies. So in the purest Hollywood tradition, our actors are also hoping to be discovered by visiting agents and producers, who see the Fringe as a source of hot, young, comic talent. The Fringe will follow a group of funny, talented and raw 20-something actors as they write, produce, market and perform their own original theater productions in this unbelievably zany, pressure-packed and competitive environment. With over 150 other shows in competition with each other, our stars-to-be must deliver a quality production and design a sophisticated marketing strategy to win over both the media and the crowds. Will they succeed? Will they be discovered? Or will they bomb miserably? Our talented and funny newbies will also get the chance to meet and get some tips from experienced comedic actors and Fringe Festival veterans including Joe Flaherty (SCTV), Nathan Fillion (Firefly) and Ron Pederson (Mad TV). For those who are into hip humor and improvised comedy, The Fringe showcases the hilarious and at times frenetic quest of an appealing group of young up-and-comers as they pursue their dreams of fame, fortune and glory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559278</url></doc>
