<plot>Our staff of photographers was at hand at Canton, Ohio, on September 18th and 19th to secure the pictures of the funeral ceremonies at that city. We list below seven films, all of which are absolutely perfect photographically and of a highly interesting nature. Each film is described and listed separately, but the negative is so arranged that when the entire series is purchased the dissolving effects are secured; that is to say, the first scene in the series dissolves into the second and so on until the entire series of Canton pictures is shown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112907</url></doc>
