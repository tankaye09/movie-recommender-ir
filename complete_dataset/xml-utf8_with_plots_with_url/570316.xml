<plot>An intensive look at the spirit of motorcycling: from Sturgis to the Salt Flats, le Mans to the Isle of Man, Laguna Seca to the gangs of New York. Motorcycle culture lives large among businessmen, women, racers, cruisers and outlaws alike. LMZ first aired on the Discovery Channel in July 1994 and became one of the highest rated programs of that year.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570316</url></doc>
