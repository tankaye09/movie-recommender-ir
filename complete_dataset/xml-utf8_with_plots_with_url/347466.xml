<plot>Jan's life is good. A husband and two children she loves, nice house, good job. So why isn't she happy? Where does this sense of unease, of restlessness come from? On a morning like every other morning, a phone call from the guy she used to think of as "the love of her life" may change everything. What might her life have been had she made different choices? She meets him for lunch, and the intimate encounter that follows forces Jan to really look at her life. Memory is sometimes much more about imagination than recollection - and Jan realizes that idealizing the past can blind you to the present.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?347466</url></doc>
