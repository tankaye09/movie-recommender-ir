<plot>Life often consists of unexpected change, Episcopal priest Susan Russell knows this better than most. Her life is defined by a remarkable series of changes that put into question her beliefs, her life roles and her most basic understanding of who she is. "The Constant Process" explores the challenges and surprises of her journey from obscurity to leadership, from religious inactivity to inspired theologian, from heterosexual to homosexual. On all these levels Susan's story defies stereotypes, challenges orthodoxies and provides a catalyst for examining our own lives, ethics, and beliefs. What makes Susan's story compelling is that her faith and her sexuality are inextricably tied. Her life long spiritual journey from being Christian in name only to being ordained as a priest, led directly to her coming out as a lesbian. This being the case the film explores areas usually omitted by the media in its coverage of religion, gay rights and gay marriage; these being the individual, spiritual, and theological aspects of the issues and how they play out in one woman's life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550015</url></doc>
