<plot>Author M.F.K. Fisher, often considered the dean of American food writers, in a casual monologue about her life and work with illustrations from her own photo archives. She talks in her house in Sonoma, CA., where she has lived for many years. Author of many books, including "With Bold Knife and Fork", "Consider the Oyster" and "How to Cook a Wolf", Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher was also a screen writer, a novelist and short story writer (often published in "The New Yorker" magazine) and lived for long periods abroad. It was to food that she returned again and again, and it is through writing about food that she conveyed her view of the life of her times. "When I write about food and hunger I am really writing about love, and the hunger for it, and warmth, and the love of it - it is all one."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091557</url></doc>
