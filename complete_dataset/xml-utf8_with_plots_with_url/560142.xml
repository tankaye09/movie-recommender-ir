<plot>The German Lullaby is about two women Anna and Molly who live in present day New York. Molly (who has a Jewish background) finds out that Anna's family (who are of German descent) gave up a little Jewish girl, Hannah, in the Second World War to save their family. The German Lullaby reflects how hard it was for Germans in the 1940's as well as the Jews. Most people had no choice and did what they had to do to survive in those days.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?560142</url></doc>
