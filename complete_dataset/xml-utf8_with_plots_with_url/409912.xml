<plot>'Olivia' tells the tragic tale of a young girl who lives in a world of isolation and uses fairy tales as a means of escapism from her cynical and abusive father, who is in a constant state of despair after the loss of his wife. Olivia's mother died when she was only an infant, and she never fully understood the reasons behind her death. Their house is situated on the edge of a wood, and Olivia is often seen wandering through the trees or perched up against one reading her fairy tales. After a confrontation with her father, Olivia comes across a book in her dark and dingy bedroom, which to her surprise she has never read before. As she begins to read, she unravels her father's past and the relationship he had with Olivia's mother in a fairy tale-like manner with a hint of realism that parallels a family history she never knew.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409912</url></doc>
