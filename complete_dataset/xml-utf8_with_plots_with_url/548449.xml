<plot>Two little children, a boy and a girl, are playing at building houses with stones. While they are thus busily engaged, a frog jumps out from the grass, much to their amazement. They quickly jump up and try to catch the frog, but he is too slippery and easily gets away. The action in this, as in the companion pictures of this series, is exceedingly natural.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548449</url></doc>
