<plot>For more than thirty years Jurek has been running an open air cinema - one of the last remaining ones in Poland today. It's a tough job as business is declining and Jurek struggles to keep his cinema alive. However, against all odds Jurek has decided not to give up. "It's the beautiful rattling of the projectors that still keeps me going", he says. A subtle portrait about nostalgia, Northern Poland, its people and the love for cinema.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282032</url></doc>
