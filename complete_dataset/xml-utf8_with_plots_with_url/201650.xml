<plot>Howard is a well known photographer who has dedicated his life to documenting life in Cornwall through his photographs. Now he is reaching the end of his life and attempting to sort through his notes and photographs kept at his house to compile a book. His family have separated from him due to his difficult nature, so when his niece, Charlotte, gets in trouble at home she is sent to help Howard as punishment. She calls round after school each week and gradually begins to take an interest in photography. He nurtures this interest and asks her to take one final photograph.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201650</url></doc>
