<plot>The film poses the question "What does it mean to be an American in a time of uncertainty and fear?" The subject area is the fragile nature of civil rights, and it explores the Japanese American internment through the lens of 9/11. The objective of the film is to offer, in this critical season of the Patriot Act--when public dissent is discouraged--the view of one citizen, Frank Kitamoto, who was denied his rights and identity as an American 60 years ago. It was during a similar time of fear and emergency following Pearl Harbor, when President Roosevelt was given sweeping powers much as our President has now. This film is intended to promote discussion on civil rights, citizenship, discrimination, and the dangers of setting aside the Constitution in times of crisis--when it would seem that we need it the most.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025214</url></doc>
