<plot>A Danish man has lost his faith. Previously religious, he has come to doubt and goes to Jerusalem to regain his confidence. In Jerusalem, he meets modern-day prophets of three religions: Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Through conversations with these men, dedicated to help other people, he tries to learn about his own ideals and the contradiction between belief and reasoning. But not only the long conversations, but also the life of Jerusalm and the prophets is to teach him something.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275966</url></doc>
