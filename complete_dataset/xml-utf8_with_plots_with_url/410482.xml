<plot>Recent college graduate, Michael Green, is embarking on his first job interview but isn't sure who he is or who he wants to be. The roots of Michael's identity crisis are revealed in several flashbacks to poignant events from his childhood. He reflects on these memories and struggles through the interview ritual, while enduring his mother's nagging to go on a family trip to his grandmother's house for Hanukkah - a trip that he believes may interfere with his opportunity to accept a job. Past, present and future collide as Michael is shown into the conference room for his interview. He has the right suit, the right tie and the right haircut - but isn't sure he has the right religion. Will he get the job? Will he go on the family trip?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410482</url></doc>
