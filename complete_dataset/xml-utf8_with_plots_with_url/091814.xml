<plot>Sneakers. Most people take them for granted, maybe buying a new pair with the change of season. But there's a whole subculture of kids who will do anything for the newest pair of kicks. Leon, a sneakerhead, has spent enough on his collection to have bought a Range Rover, but it doesn't stop him from buying more. Chris, a sneaker boutique employee, has seen shoes go for as much as $3,000. And then there's the mob of camp-out kids, in which this this obsession fully comes to a head. Watch as these sneakerheads spend the frigid night outside of a shoe store waiting to get their next fix: a pair of kicks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091814</url></doc>
