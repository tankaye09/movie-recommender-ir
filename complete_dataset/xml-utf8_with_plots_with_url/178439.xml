<plot>The successful spin-off series of the ill-fated "Moolah Beach" would still focus on the teams living on the beach on which it does. But unlike "Moolah," groups of eight are about to collect Pyramid Pieces just before sending one team to the "Temple of Fate." Eight colored teams (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown and gray), each one consisting of a boy and a girl compete to win an exotic vacation by winning physical challenges and to be the first team to collect all 10 "Pyramid Pieces," in this teenage "Survivor" show. Winning these pieces involves two separate missions, the first challenge is an "Endurance Mission," and the winning team of that challenge will earn a Pyramid Piece, including the "Samahdi," which will handicap an team of their choice in the following challenge, which is the "Temple Mission." The missions are very important to win because the winners have the privilege of picking any two teams to be sent to the "Temple of Fate," where each team will compete in a rock-paper-scissors like game. The team that loses will be sent home, however, they can pick any team to send the Pyramid Piece to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178439</url></doc>
