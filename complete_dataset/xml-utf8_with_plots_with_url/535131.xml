<plot>One at a time, each by herself, ten women speak directly into the camera and talk about themselves. Talking about a relationship with a man - sometimes a long-term one and more often a brief one - triggers remembrances of a parent lost, of a pet, of childhood. The first woman talks about running into a true love several years later, the second describes her loss of virginity, the third recounts a discomforting blind date; only one woman has experienced a long-term marriage. Dreams figure into several stories. Some ask "Is there only one great love?" "Where am I when I'm in a relationship - even one that ends in a night?," is a question others raise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?535131</url></doc>
