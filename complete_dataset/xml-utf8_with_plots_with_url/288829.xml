<plot>Attractive young women in India are being lured away by criminal elements on promises of wealth, a better life, acting in movies, and are never heard of again. The Indian Chief of Secret Service assigns this case to Agent 116, Gopal, who accepts the assignment, gets involved, and shortly thereafter intercepts a yacht allegedly carrying a number of these young women - only to find that the yacht is empty, and the girls have been drowned and killed. Then a young woman named Sudha, whose sister, Nanda, has been missing, volunteers to go with the criminals, with Gopal tracking her. What Gopal and Sudha do not know is that the women are being ferried to an island that is outside the jurisdiction of India, or any country for that matter, where the girls will be sold to the highest international bidder, and those who do not confirm to the rules are either shot dead or let lose and hunted down savagely by killer dogs and armed hunters. Gopal and Sudha also do not know that their involvement has been compromised and a violent death awaits them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?288829</url></doc>
