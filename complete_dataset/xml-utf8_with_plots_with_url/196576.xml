<plot>This bootleg video graffiti glimpse into the lives and thoughts of critically acclaimed, established and emerging soul artists shows them at their most direct and honest, talking about their relation to the ideas, history and business behind the music. It's a backstage digital sketchbook of fierce opinion and considered reflection, a grassroots response to the homogenization and appropriation of music culture by big business. More than a survey of "neo soul," this documents the feelings and thoughts that drive and support two generations of black visionaries. Candid interviews and rare footage captures the essence of such artists as Teddy Pendergrass, ?uestLove, Jaquar Wright, Fertile Ground, George Clinton, Julie Dexter, Olu Butterfly Woods, Maysa Leak.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196576</url></doc>
