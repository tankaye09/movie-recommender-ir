<plot>A young woman is trailing a couple at the park, intensely watching them though her camera. As she's about to secretly take their photo a young man appears from nowhere, unabashedly commenting on what she is doing. At first determined to ignore him, she immediately forgets her resolve when he remarks on how happy the couple looks. This sets into motion a tug-of-war exchange between the two: while she holds the firm belief that relationships have become obsolete, he repeatedly challenges her jaded point of view with a striking optimism on love. In the end, she is forced to make a choice: continue to vicariously live through the subjects she photographs, or open herself up to the possibilities of love... which could be sitting right next to her on the park bench.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582156</url></doc>
