<plot>Southern California, 1942: Nikolas Alexander, son of an immigrant factory worker, is about to become next in line to carry on the family tradition. On his thirteenth birthday, his gift from his older brother is a job at the local oil refinery. Nikolas is "a man today" and is expected to quit school and worst of all - give up his interest in writing. After all, dreams and stories are just an amusing pastime compared with a good day's work at the factory. Nikolas resists and the brothers clash - over traditions, expectations, and the need for "prudence". For Nikolas to truly be a man today, he must find the courage to show everyone his resolve - including himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396845</url></doc>
