<plot>"Rags" is an ensemble dramatic movie that runs within the same vain with such blockbuster movies as "Magnolia" and "Traffic" with an authenticity of "Wall Street" in the fashion industry. Our young star had big dreams of becoming a successful fashion designer. Raised in Philly by her single mother SANDY, she was mocked for the run down clothes she wore. Having the same aspirations at a younger age, Sandy wanted her daughter to have no part of the fashion industry, but to focus on an education. She also wanted her daughter to stay away from her best friend ALLISON, due to her mother's drug habit. A habit that eventually took her life. With Sandy's decision to raise Allison as her own, our star remained close with her friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453799</url></doc>
