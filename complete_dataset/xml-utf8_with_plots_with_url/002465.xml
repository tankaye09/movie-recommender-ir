<plot>"About 15,000 soldiers are seen in military order marching past the reviewing stand at Camp Alger, May 28. This picture appeals to those who remember war times from 1861-1865, when thousands who went away light-hearted and gay to fight for a cause they considered just failed to return. It thrills us to think that our soldiers, at present time about to leave for the enemy's country, may never see American soil again, and we bid them Godspeed in their undertaking. Their faces are clear and distinct and each figure stands out in bold relief. A touching picture that will interest everybody."</plot><plot>"About 15,000 soldiers are seen in military order marching past the reviewing stand at Camp Alger, May 28.
