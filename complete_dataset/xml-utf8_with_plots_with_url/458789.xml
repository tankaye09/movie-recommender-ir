<plot>When Marla (Laney Smith) receives a call that her Aunt Helen (Laura Durant) is ill, Marla decides to take a break from her redundant city life and head to the small town of North Lake to help her out. There, she meets Jesse Collins (Michael Jason Allen). After dating for a while, Marla begins to recognize Jesse's playboy reputation. Coupled with the interference of vindictive mean girl Cora (Joanna Ke) (whom is an ex-girlfriend of Jesse's), Marla puts a permanent hold on things. Jesse then tries to convince Marla that she's wrong about him and he only has good intentions towards her, so he throws out a desperate plea by giving her names of his ex-girlfriends as references. Attempting to clear his name, Marla now finds herself playing detective to find out "the real" Jesse. It is this unique plea that takes the story into a twist of emotional ups &amp; downs... and a second guessing of intentions by all involved. After all is done, this town with "no strangers" will be changed forever. With its memorable soundtrack and unforgettable montages, this film guarantees to make you feel as though you live in North Lake yourself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458789</url></doc>
