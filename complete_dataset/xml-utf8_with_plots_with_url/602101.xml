<plot>Scene, a building in course of construction. Hodcarrier arrives, and placing the hod in an upright position, he turns his attention to a load of bricks nearby. Wishing to fill the hod and being too lazy to stoop for bricks, he commands them to come to him. Suddenly the bricks are seen to rise from the ground and jump into his hands. One by one they are placed in the hod, until it is filled. His commands thus far having been obeyed, he tries it again on the hod. Walking away from it, he beckons it to follow him, and instantly it begins to move. Scene now changes to the scaffold. The hodcarrier jumps to it from the ground, and is followed by the hod and bricks. After emptying the hod, he goes for mortar and this is secured in the same way as the bricks. After putting the mortar on the board used for holding it, the hodcarrier leaves the scene. Upon seeing the success met by the hodcarrier, the bricklayer, who has been working on the scaffold, tries his hand with the magical bricks and mortar. He commands them to come to him. They rise from where they were placed by the hodcarrier, and adjust themselves in place on the building. A very amusing subject and sure to cause a laugh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602101</url></doc>
