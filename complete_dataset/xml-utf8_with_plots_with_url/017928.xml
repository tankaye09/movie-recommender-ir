<plot>Mayuko rebels against her family in rural Japan and leaves to pursue her dream in Los Angeles. After failing to gain work as an actor she ends up working in a peep show parlor to make ends meet. Not being able to take it anymore Mayuko telephones home hoping to persuade them to send her money so she can buy a ticket to return home. She learns from her angry father that her grandfather has died and he tells her to never return home. Mayuko devises a desperate plan and she slowly takes sleeping pills trying to stay awake long enough to make contact with her grandfather in the after world before she dies in hopes he will guide her spirit home. She is unexpectedly awakened by a psychotic peep show regular named Galopin the Great(aka Harold) who believes he is the world's greatest pantomime. Galopin and Mayuko's longing for what they can't have causes them to bond together and help Mayuko choose life over death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017928</url></doc>
