<plot>Johnny Lincoln Clem was a small boy from Newark, Ohio living during a troubled time in the American Civil War. Shortly after his mother was killed while crossing a railroad track, Johnny ran away from home to join the 22nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry. Initially turned away by the officers, the boy followed the regiment into Kentucky and down south, and was looked after by the men. Finally accepted into their ranks, he fought with them at the battle of Chickamauga, where to save his life he was forced to shoot down a charging Confederate Colonel who had him in his sights. His story became legend across the country, appearing in newspapers and song, and this fame brought Johnny the honor of becoming the youngest non-commissioned officer ever in the United States Army when General George Thomas promoted the boy to the rank of Lance Sergeant and personal courier to his staff. Captured once and wounded twice on the field of battle, he was finally sent back home just before the eve of the war to return to his family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278603</url></doc>
