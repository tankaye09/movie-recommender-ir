<plot>From Cape Town with Love reveals the world and nature of the street artist. In the inner city, where gray buildings form part of a bland landscape, a community of graffiti writers and street artists rebel not only against the law and conventions but against dull public spaces and apathy. From Cape Town with Love takes a tour through the streets of Cape Town, introducing street art where it's at, or rather where it has been put. Beautiful and thought provoking images and text are (temporarily) displayed for all to see, designed to enlighten, inspire and contribute to the community... all are punishable by imprisonment and/or heavy fines. Through the different and dangerous processes of creation, the intent behind the 'malicious damage to property' is captured and debated. Artists, Graffiti writers, historians and government officials explain their views and policies. Between the paint and the concrete, there is a hidden world, a world of expression and community. A world that despite its reputation is not ruled by gangsters, hip hop and violence, but that supports, considers and inspires its occupants and outsiders alike. By journeying into this space and the community, through the experience and process of creating a work, the nature and intent of the street artist will emerge. Public space will never be the same again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204849</url></doc>
