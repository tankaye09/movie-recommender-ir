<plot>Mark is a high school senior who makes a personal problem out of his parents break-up when his mother leaves home for another woman. The thought of being the butt of jokes for "having two fathers" horrifies him. All these worries and angst take the backseat when a new teacher comes to campus. Her name is Connie and she is an instant hit among the boys. It is love at first sight for Mark. However, Connie has an affair with Vincent, a married man. Soon Carmela, Vincent's wife, finds out about the affair and creates a scandal in school. She lodges a complaint to get Connie fired. Alberto, Mark's father, comes to the rescue and defends Connie at the inquest. In the meantime, Connie reciprocates the attention Mark giver her but gets carried away in the heat of passion. Connie decides to go away. Mark will have no clue where she has gone until seven years after when she returns home as a lawyer. He runs into Connie who has since married.
