<plot>WESTBOUND. a documentary A piece of wood, a pocketknife, and nothing but time. Hobo art and tramp art were born of an independent spirit. Hobos whittle. Tramps carve. Both craft amazing objects from discarded items. One man, Adolph Vandertie - the Grand Duke of the Hobos - created over 4,000 rare and beautiful pieces of this distinctive folk art form, now preserved by the John Michael Kohler Arts Center. As a child during the Depression, Adolph faced a lifetime of hardship and heartache. Westbound is his story. A story where unflinching American history and uniquely American art merge. With the stark relevance of today - Westbound strives to uncover the need to preserve the past in the hope of understanding the present.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650969</url></doc>
