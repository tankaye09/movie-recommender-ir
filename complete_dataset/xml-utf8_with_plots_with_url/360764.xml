<plot>An hour-long combo of two classic quiz shows, hosted by Gene Rayburn and Jon Bauman. In the Match Game half, a group of celebrities would be given a sentence with a missing word, which they would then have to fill in. The contestants would then give their own answer, and scored points according to how many celebrities gave the same answer. In the Hollywood Squares half, the celebrities, seated in squares in a tic-tac-toe arrangement, would give their answers to questions on various subjects. The contestants would then have to guess whether or not a celebrity's answer was right. Contestants guessing correctly would gain control of the square. Gaining control of three squares in a row would win the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360764</url></doc>
