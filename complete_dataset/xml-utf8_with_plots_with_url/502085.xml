<plot>On his 8th birthday, young Sly Cooper receives the Thievius Raccoonus, a book on how to become a master thief from his father. Suddenly, a group of ruthless criminals called the Fiendish Five, which consist of pirate frog Sir Raleigh, muscular-but-dumb bulldog Muggshot, Voodoo alligator Mz. Ruby, fireworks maker Panda King, and cyborg owl Clockwerk invade the Cooper home, kill Sly's dad, steal the Thievius Raccoonus, and rip it into five sections of pages. Sly is sent to an orphanage where he becomes best friends with Bentley, a techno-genius but worrywart turtle; and Murray, a cowardly hippo good at driving. Tgether, they work to defeat the Fiendish Five and win back the Thievius Raccoonus. But hot on their tail is Inspector Carmelita Fox, an attractive poice agent bent on capturing and jailing Sly. Will Sly defeat the Fiendish Five and get back the Thievius Raccoonus? Play and find out!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502085</url></doc>
