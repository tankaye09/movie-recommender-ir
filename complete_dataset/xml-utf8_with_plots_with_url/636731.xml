<plot>Another interesting subject taken at Fort Myer, Va. The rider in this picture is handling two spirited cavalry horses, seated in the saddle of one and leading the other. As he nears the hurdle, he jumps to the ground, running beside his own mount until both horses rise to make the hurdle jump, when he vaults over the back of the horse he has formerly ridden, gracefully alighting in the saddle of the horse he has been leading. This is regarded by military men as an extremely difficult feat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?636731</url></doc>
