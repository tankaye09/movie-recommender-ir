<plot>A remarkable story of hope, compassion, repentance, and love. He had made a serious mistake that deeply grieved his father and angered his older brother. Then, finally, he changed. After months in a rehabilitation center, his return home was a thrill to everyone--except his brother. Burdened by pride and resentment, the older brother disbelieved his younger brother's change of heart. This pride and resentment threatened to destroy any hope for peace in the reunited family. The Prodigal Son, a modern-day drama, shows how our improper choices affect us. It also depicts the positive results of humbly accepting our Savior and his teachings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584337</url></doc>
