<plot>After coming to Shanghai on a college-graduation trip with two college buddies, Terrence decides to stay. All the partying, beautiful girls, and good food convinced Terrence this was the place to be. Supporting himself through odd jobs and teaching English, Terrence is having the time of his life. We fast-forward seven years and Terrence is still an English teacher in Shanghai without much of a career except some shady unknown dealings (will reveal in next film). At the crossroads of his life, Terrence is having a midlife crisis and debating future options about returning home or staying in Shanghai. He questions purpose of life and starts soul searching with the help of alcohol and delusional fantasies while wandering around town looking for the answer to his dilemma.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006410</url></doc>
