<plot>Brett Penance has been murdered. A popular and honor student about to attend Stanford University, he is also a champion surfer and an environmental activist (or so it seems). You have only 6 hours to solve this murder. With the help of your assistant Lucie Fairwell, you must carefully examine the crime scene, retrace the victim's last steps, interrogate the suspects, and analyze the results of forensic testing. Is this murder an act of jealousy, or an act of anger, or is the murder secondary to an alternate motive? Before you can present the evidence to the judge for warrant application, you must answer to the public by holding a press conference. Only with diligent detective skills can you catch the killer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655095</url></doc>
