<plot>Michael is a gifted 10-year-old boy with a dream. He wants to write the first opera for puppets - a fascination he has inherited from his beloved grandfather. He is just like any other 10-year-old. He enjoys playing with his friends, although at times they let him down. He loves his mother and father, although at times they aren't very good at being parents. In a cruel twist, fate makes him unwell. His doctor and everyone who know him, quickly realize what a good person he is, that he is special. He is blessed with a quiet ability to heal other people's troubles, to make their lives better. Everyone has a dream and it is Michael's greatest wish that they fulfill their dreams as best they can. For Michael, he finds a voice with his puppets that become as real as the people in his life, and they become an escape from the harsher realities surrounding him. 'Dreams' is the tear jerking story of a whole wonderful life accelerated by a cruel illness into a few short months and a boy who never loses sight of his humor and grace and who becomes a source of joy and happiness to those around him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159632</url></doc>
