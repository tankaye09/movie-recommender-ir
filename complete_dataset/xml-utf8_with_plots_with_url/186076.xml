<plot>A large ornamental flower pot stands in the center of the stage, a Chinese garden scene forming the background. From the flower pot arises a large Chinese umbrella, which expands and exposes a Chinese magician, who takes up the jar and throws it to the audience. It suddenly changes into a number of Chinese lanterns, which fly upwards and over the spectators with a weird and startling effect. The magician then seizes the umbrella and closes it, when it suddenly changes into a lamp. The climax of this great scene is reached when the magician spreads his arms and the long sleeves of his costume become gigantic bat's wings, while his head grows larger and larger and his body smaller and smaller and he flies directly at the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186076</url></doc>
