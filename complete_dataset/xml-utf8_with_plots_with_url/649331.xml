<plot>Weaving Worlds highlights Navajo tales of how the west was spun, exploring the personal stories of Navajo weavers and their complex relationship with reservation traders. The film examines the delicate balance between cultural survival, economic independence, and artistic motivation evident in the everyday lives of Navajo weavers. While their creations are highly valued and collected around the world, foremost for weavers is the constant quest for cultural continuity through creating their textiles and the effects of globalization on their land, their sheep, and their livelihoods.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649331</url></doc>
