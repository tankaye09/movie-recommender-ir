<plot>The popular Milton-Bradley game "Battleships" was the basis for this general-knowledge quiz show, in which two contestants one a champion competed. The two contestants (called "hunters") were each given three plastic animals (a rhinoceros, a lion and an alligator) which they secretly placed in their "jungle," or game board, that was hidden from their opponent's view. Host Kennedy then asked the contestants general-knowledge questions. Correct answers allowed the players to "shoot" at their opponent's hidden game board, hoping their opponent had placed their animals there. The first player to "shoot" all three animals won $2,000 and the right to compete against a new challenger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?543655</url></doc>
