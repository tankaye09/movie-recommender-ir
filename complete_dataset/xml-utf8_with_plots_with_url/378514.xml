<plot>In Sao Paulo, there are some 250 thousand messenger boys on motorbikes. Three die a day, on average. The film addresses the root of the question and follows along with the day-to-day life of five motoboys. The film also shows the drivers' point of view. The director says he decided to broach the subject six years ago when he saw the tremendous growth in the number of messenger boys in town: "I realized that this was the result both unemployment in legal jobs and crazy city traffic, where cars always come first. Nothing more contemporary in Sao Paulo than the motoboys. This is a city that seems to crush human beings in order to grow and the motorboys are it."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378514</url></doc>
