<plot>This two-part DVD, hosted by Dr. John Tyson, presents comprehensive, medically sound information that deals simply and honestly with the many aspects of childbirth. It answers many of the sensitive questions of parents-to-be, enables them to formulate a list of concerns to discuss with their physician, and promotes a healthier, safer pregnancy. Part 1 of this six-phase program takes us from the pregnancy and planning stages to the actual delivery. Areas covered include Amniocentesis and Ultrasound, morning sickness and a review of drugs. Group discussions, two exercise segments and several actual births make this the most comprehensive program of its kind. This extensive, enhanced DVD production includes an Interactive Pregnancy Risk Test, a Pregnancy Checklist, phase-by-phase reviews, as well as other Bonus Featured.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103090</url></doc>
