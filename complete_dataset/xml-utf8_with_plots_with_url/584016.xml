<plot>After completing college, Armstrong Prince returns home to his family and friends. The neighbourhood is not much to look at and there's not much to appreciate, but it's his childhood home and he's proud of his heritage. With a promising career ahead of him and many unlikely accomplishments under his belt, he quickly becomes everybody's favourite son. But, that all changes when a young girl is raped and Armstrong is forced into a very peculiar situation where the community is divided. Everyone begins to wonder whether or not honesty will prevail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584016</url></doc>
