<plot>This 1954 film is a ten-minute short with no cast since it is just a collection of stills and old-newsreel footage from the first couple of decades of the 20th century and the latter part of the 19th century, including an Easter Day Parade on Fifth Avenue in the Gay Nineties. Also shown are the Wright Brothers, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the Ohio floods of 1913, and ends with the inaugral parade of US President Woodrow Wilson in which future US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was present as a West Point cadet. Robert Youngson produced several of these shorts, for Warners, in the early 50's, and they may have been spliced together for TV showings in feature length. This, and other titles such as "It Happend to You" were originally stand-alone Shorts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253003</url></doc>
