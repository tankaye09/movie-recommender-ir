<plot>Wynonna Judd's pilgrimage to Venice, Italy, for the third episode of Music in High Places premiered December 1, 2000. The series takes entertainers to faraway lands to experience foreign cultures as well as to perform. Judd's episode features the singer in acoustic performances outside Venetian canals, in front of the ancient 13th-century castle in the village of Fontanellato and performing in the cathedral Basilica Di San Patronio, a true feat, considering her performance required prior consent from the Vatican. International singing star Zucchero performs alongside Judd during one segment ("No One Else on Earth").</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382395</url></doc>
