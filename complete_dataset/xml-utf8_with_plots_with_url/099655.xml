<plot>The sights and sounds of the late Seventies come alive in this comical tale of the night in the life of a group movie theater ushers, just before their beloved Suffolk Theater goes out of business. Danny has to choose between his loyalty to the Suffolk and a job at the new local multiplex which has driven the Suffolk out of business. Joey is getting cold feet before his wedding and a chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend could change his future. Jessie tires to shed his image as "the toughest guy in town" to impress Rachel, the ticket girl, but a local hood wants his title. Bobby falls for a prank that could cut the Suffolk's last day even shorter. A sweet look back at a time when going to the local movie theater meant more than just going to the movies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099655</url></doc>
