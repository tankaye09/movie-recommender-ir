Flashback takes us back to Franco's ruthless dictatorship era. Elisita is an intelligent young but mature woman who lives with her rich widower and extremely catholic mother Dona Elisa. Elisita's mother encourages her to find a husband and marry before she is too old. Enter Antonio a young student friend of the family who is preparing for his school exams. Too young to be her husband, Antonio is mutually attracted by her caring personality. Elisita is asked to help Antonio with his Latin and math lessons. As they spend several afternoons together they develop a close bond. Elisita knows this might be her last chance to fall in love and his first encounter with passion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175429</url></doc>
