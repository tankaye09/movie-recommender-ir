<plot>The life of a man at the end of his days is nothing more than a search to find peace, even more so when no he is no longer appreciated by their loved ones and their environment in general. A man looks for peace in any way possible was long as it arrives. The story involves a man disconnected from this world and of all people around him, especially his daughter, which is his only loved one left. She treats his father not like a human being, much less like a father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426974</url></doc>
