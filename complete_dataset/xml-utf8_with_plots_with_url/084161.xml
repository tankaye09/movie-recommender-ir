<plot>This picture shows a typical Western scene on the plains, with an artistic mountain background. Here are to be seen cowboys indulging in their favorite sport of broncho busting. These bronchos are the wild horses of the plains and have had no care whatever from man, so naturally their actions are characteristic of vicious animals. First the horse is lassoed, thrown to the ground, saddled and mounted. Then the fun begins. The wild horse begins his tactics to free himself from saddle and rider, and the contortions he goes through makes the picture distinctly Western.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084161</url></doc>
