<plot>Far beneath New York City's streets, there is a world, a world that few know of, where only the best compete. A world where ping pong is the game, and your life is the wager. This dark realm lies in the shadows under the greatest metropolis on earth. For centuries, it was controlled by the Italians. The Italians have all but disappeared since the Chinese took over, and now there is only one. An Italian ping pong warrior who continues the age-old struggle and seeks to turn back time. He is the last hope for a has-been coach and an entire race imprisoned within their memories of a dying past. He will fight, using the only weapons he has ever known. He will once again do battle to gain dominance in: THE UNDERGROUND: New York Ping Pong.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597999</url></doc>
