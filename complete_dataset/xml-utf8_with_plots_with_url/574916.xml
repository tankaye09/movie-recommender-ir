<plot>Tanvi Balana is the wife of an attorney who practically lives in his office. Constantly looking for new ways to keep her husband's attention, she decides to surprise him by coming home a day earlier than expected from a trip out of town and stops by his office; it is deserted. Unable to reach her husband on his phone all day, she begins to get suspicious. Later that night she overhears a whispered phone conversation between her husband and a supposed business colleague and wakes up to find a strange black man in her house. The stranger insists her husband is having an affair and for the right price, will show her where her husband has been spending nights while she has been gone. Still unable to reach her husband, Tanvi chooses to trust the man and discovers a terrible truth about the man she thought she knew. The Man In My House examines the burden of responsibility in a marriage between partners who struggle to accept the reality of those they love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574916</url></doc>
