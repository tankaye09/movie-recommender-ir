<plot>Against a breathtaking Highland background, a young woman seeks understanding and closure with her father. Deer stalking has come to symbolise a perfect and idyllic childhood, one the filmmaker holds with nostalgic softness. Through examining this symbolic tradition she forces her father to acknowledge the rift that has developed between them. Dear Dad is an honest and insightful documentary about the emotional impact caused by unwanted change. A beautiful and poignant exploration of the relationship between the filmmaker and her father. It is one persons wish to understand. It is a simple and touching attempt at reconciliation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133642</url></doc>
