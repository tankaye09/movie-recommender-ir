<plot>A beautiful and wonderful subject is this. A burglar enters and grasping the lady by the throat who is seated with her back to him, he throttles her and throws her on the floor. He breaks open her cabinet and turning around and seeing her move he places her in a trunk and strangles her. Her ghost rises and confronts him, which he attempts to fight off, but to no purpose. A picture of Justice is seen in the background, and while he is struggling with his conscience, the officers come in and arrest him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086960</url></doc>
