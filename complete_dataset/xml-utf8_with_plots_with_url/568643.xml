<plot>The true story of the clandestine committee formed by American aviation artist Clayton Knight that altered the course of WWII by recruiting thousands of American pilots for the Allies during US neutrality. A political thriller that explores the American foreign policy battle between the pro-war democrats (led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt) and the isolationist republicans (led by aviation icon Charles Lindberg) that shaped the current policy of US interventionism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568643</url></doc>
