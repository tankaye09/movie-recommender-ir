<plot>A couple has checked into a nondescript hotel, video camera in hand, to make their very first sex tape. He starts shooting; the camera is date stamped January 3, 2003, at 3:23 in the afternoon. He's excited, he gets the lens cap off, but soon he seems to be getting more than he bargained for. She turns out to be pretty accomplished at this, an argument ensues, and the camera may be recording something completely different from what was planned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417749</url></doc>
