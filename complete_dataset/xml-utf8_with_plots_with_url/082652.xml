<plot>For months and months we have all known that the election will take place on the 5th May 2005. Whenever Blair finally got round to officially announcing it, the election campaign kicked off and quickly (?) we found ourselves on the eve of polling. Michael Howard is out on the streets pressing the flesh and trying to prove that he isn't out to hurt anybody; Tony Blair is struggling to drop the insincere sheen of slogans and spin, even when he is at home - much the annoyance of Cherie and Charles Kennedy gets realistic about what his party can actually achieve. Meanwhile the chattering classes debate their vote and discuss their reasons over after dinner wine and cheese, politicians spin their way through interviews and the voters mostly just stay at home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082652</url></doc>
