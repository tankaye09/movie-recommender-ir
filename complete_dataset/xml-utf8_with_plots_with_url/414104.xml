<plot>Out of state, out of the country, and out of their minds. They were all  patrons at the Time to Eat Diner as featured in the documentary 'OPEN 24 HOURS', a story of stories captured during a straight 24-hour period that commenced at 6:00 AM EST on June 20, 2008, the longest Friday of the year. The intriguing stories of diner-goers are told through conversations with customers on the backdrop of the recently renovated Time to Eat Diner in Bridgewater, New Jersey. Accessible from six major highways this diner is one of the best known in the heart of the Garden State, the queen land of diners. Whether it is the eccentric teenage waitress, the sweet elderly couple, or the intoxicated drug addict, 'OPEN 24 HOURS' is a commentary on the spectrum of the American diner culture, but more importantly... the New Jersey experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?414104</url></doc>
