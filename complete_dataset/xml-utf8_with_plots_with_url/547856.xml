<plot>A cave prisoner has spent his entire life tied up looking at animal shadows passing by a wall. He eventually frees himself, and becomes enlightened as he leaves the cave and discovers the beauty of the world outside of the cave with real animals. He returns to tell his fellow prisoners about his discoveries by drawing the findings onto a wall, and tries to convince them to go with him, but is rejected. Thus, he decides to run out of the cave leaving his fellow prisoners behind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547856</url></doc>
