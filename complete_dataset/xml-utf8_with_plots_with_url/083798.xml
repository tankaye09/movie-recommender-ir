<plot>The owner of a pawn shop, David Woolfson, is a banker of last resort. A grouchy old guy with a mushy heart, Jewish immigrant from South Africa, he's been running the store for nearly 16 years. Not that he needs to. It's just that, if he was stuck at home, he would go mad. Then, one day, Chris Hoard, ex-convict and psychopath, shows up and offers his help. For free. An unlikely friendship develops. However, Chris has his own luggage to carry, and it is wearing him down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083798</url></doc>
