<plot>Award-winning journalist, Carla Kelly, facing a federal subpoena for protecting her terrorist sources, is forced to return to the small town she left years earlier. She meets Lianne Rausch, a raw and emotionally disturbed high school dropout, up against a charge of attempted murder of her unborn fetus by drinking during her pregnancy.
