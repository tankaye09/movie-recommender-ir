<plot>Suwisal has turned 40. He's a forgetful businessman, a philanderer, indifferent to life around him, including his young and lovely fianc√©e. A visit to the house of his childhood triggers memories that continue to cascade when he is called for jury duty to hear the case against Piyum, a servant he seduced and abandoned 20 years before. Now a prostitute, she is on trial for murder. Can he seek forgiveness, provide restitution, or reconnect with her in any way? Should he? Will her response help him overcome his moral lethargy?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038613</url></doc>
