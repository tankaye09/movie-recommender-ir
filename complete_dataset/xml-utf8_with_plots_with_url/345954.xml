<plot>A rather gay old fellow is calling on his sweetheart. As he approaches the door of her house he is confronted by an imp. After an exciting experience with the little red chap, he enters the house. The scene changes, showing the couple in the sitting room. Suddenly the old lover is surprised to see that the girl has disappeared and that the imp has taken her place. He picks up the various pieces of furniture and attempts to strike his unwelcome visitor. Every time he raises an article to strike, the imp disappears and is seen making all sorts of grimaces at him in some other part of the room, the article landing with great force on the floor and breaking into pieces. After the lover has demolished nearly everything in the room, he picks up an elaborate lamp-stand. As it is about to land on the imp's head, the latter disappears and causes the girl to take his place. The young lady, seeing her beau about to kill her, cries in horror and attracts the attention of two passing policemen. They enter the house and eject the old chap. A highly pleasing picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345954</url></doc>
