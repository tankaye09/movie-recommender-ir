<plot>This is the story of Maxi Amberville and her attempt to save her father's empire from her uncle. It begins when Maxi Amberville's father, Zachary is found at the bottom of a cliff and dies later. Five months later, Maxi and her siblings learn that there is a board meeting that they were not informed of. They discover that their Cutter, Zachary's brother is not only in charge but has just married their mother. And also that Cutter has decided to cease operations on four magazines that have been in the red. When Maxi learns of his she threatens to reveal to her mother some of skeletons in Cutter's closet, unless he allows her to take charge of one of the magazines that he plans to close and if she can make it get into the black, the others will remain in operation. Then the story shifts to when Zachary returned from WW2, a hero, and his family is fawning all over him, which leaves Cutter pretty much out, which is the reason for the animosity between them. Zachary then goes to New York to begin his work, he eventually starts his own magazine. And before long he has several magazines under his belt, and he also finds the love of his Nina, but she rejects his marriage proposal. He then goes to England and meets Lily an aspiring dancer but when she is rejected, she decides to accept Zachary's proposal. They have two children Toby and Maxi. Now Zachary fawns all over Maxi, which sometimes Lily feels is too much, and when Toby is diagnosed as having a condition that will eventually leave him blind, things begin to unravel. She then has an affair with Cutter, who clearly is just using her to get at Zachary. Maxi would grow up to be daddy's girl, who throws herslf at Rocco Cipriani, a man who works for her father, and when she gets pregnant, they marry but divorce when Maxi clearly cannot survive without the lifestyle that her father provided for her. She would marry two more times. Eventually Zachary becomes aware of not only Cutter's affair with Lily but also of other machinations, he then cuts himself off from, which only fuels Cutter's hate for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254858</url></doc>
