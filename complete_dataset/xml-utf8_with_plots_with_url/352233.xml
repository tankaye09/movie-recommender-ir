<plot>Orphaned at a young age, Neetu Singh lives a wealthy lifestyle in Raigadh in a palace which is presided over by her aunt, Rani Maa, and Neetu's paternal uncle, Rajan Singh. She travels and lives for a few years in Switzerland, then returns back to Bombay, India, and has a run-in with some slum-dwellers near Juhu. A few days later she is abducted by two men, who had initially claimed to be palace guards, and is rescued by a male named Raju Khan, a career thief and con-man, who was one of the slum dwellers in Juhu. She reaches Raigadh and shortly thereafter is shocked to find out that Raju is claiming to be the long-lost son of Rani Maa and her betrothed. Her disbelief turns to love when the Court Astrologer confirms that Raju indeed is the sole heir to Raigadh, and both of them fall in love with each other much to the displeasure of Prem Singh, the illegitimate son of Dilip Singh (brother of Rajan) who wants Neetu and Raigadh for himself. What Neetu does not know is that Prem has hired Raju to impersonate Rani Maa's son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352233</url></doc>
