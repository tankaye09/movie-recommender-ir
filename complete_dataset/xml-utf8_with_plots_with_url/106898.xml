<plot>The young Saul works together with his father as independent lumber jacks in the African jungle. The heartless penny-pinching owner of the sawmill McDonald pays them only lowest amounts, forcing the workers to hunt wild living elephants for their ivory. However Saul has befriended one of the intelligent animals and refuses to join the hunt. Thrown out by his father, he starts to work for McDonald's Mill, who appreciates his knowledge of the jungle, but still treats him like dirt. But still Saul stays with him for the years to come, since he's fallen in love with McDonald's precious daughter Kate - which has to be kept secret from him by all means.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106898</url></doc>
