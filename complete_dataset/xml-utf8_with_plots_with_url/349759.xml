<plot>A farmer, Thakur Ram Singh lives a middle-classed lifestyle along with his wife, Saraswati. Since they have no children, they seek the blessings of a Sadhu, who tells them they will soon be parents of 3 children. They adopt a homeless orphan and name him Shiva, and shortly thereafter become parents of Satish and Koyal. Due to animosity with Arjun Singh, Ram is killed, but his killer goes unpunished. When Arjun attempts to molest Saraswati, Shiva kills him, is arrested, tried in Court, found guilty and is sentenced to several years in prison. Years later he returns home fully matured, falls in love with tall and statuesque Jharna, the niece of Arjun, and the daughter of wealthy Sher Singh, who opposes any alliance with Shiva. Shiva then arranges the marriage of Satish with Madhu, and Koyal with Chaurasia. Satish falls into bad company, arguments ensue at home and when he threatens his mother, she walks out, and Shiva follows. Sher Singh changes his mind about Shiva and decides to permit them to get married. Then Satish visits his mother, begs her forgiveness, and asks her to return. Both she and Shiva return home, and shortly thereafter Shiva gets married to Jharna. What Shiva and Saraswati do not know is that the rest of the family have planned her demise at the hands of Jharna.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349759</url></doc>
