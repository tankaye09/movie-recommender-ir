<plot>In northern Cameroon, in the Mandaras Mountains, the Mofu live a unique relationship with insects, sharing with them their homes and cultivations. This year however, a terrible drought hits the region and the termites, usually a precious ally to the Mofu, have left the fields and invaded the huts and granaries. To fight back, the Mofu people have no choice but to call for Jaglavak. Jaglavak is a ferocious army ant that has the body of a dragon. It is protected by a thick carapace and armed with terrifying pincers that cut, tear and slice through anything that falls victim to its voracity! Only Jaglavak can chase the termites out of the village.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272690</url></doc>
