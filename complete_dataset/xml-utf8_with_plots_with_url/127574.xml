<plot>Pahwa is a film buff. He watches every new release in the night show on the first day itself. Just as he readies himself to visit a nearby theatre to catch the new release Darna Mana Hai, his mother cautions him against taking the route via the graveyard. It also happens to be Friday the 13th and Amavas ki raat (new moon). Pahwa dismisses his mother's plea since he doesn't believe in ghosts and goes through the graveyard, making fun of the dead and hitting a tree in the cemetery. The movie is boring and ends with no incident, but on the way back, for some reason he's a little more nervous than usual. He hears strange noises and someone seems to be pursuing him. He reaches the cemetery gates and just as he peers back, he sees the haunting face of a witch, at which point he dies of cardiac failure. PS in the end it turns out that the strange noises were only the sound of coins that were in his pocket and the witch turns out to be the poster of the new film DARNA ZAROORI HAI. This story is actually one not told by the old lady as the other six are and the story is shown at the beginning of the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127574</url></doc>
