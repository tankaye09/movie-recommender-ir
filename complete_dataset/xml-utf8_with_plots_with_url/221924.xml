<plot>This Grantland Rice Sportlight short takes a look at the top-ranking women tennis players of the time, such as Doris Hart (not the actress), Pauline Betz, Pat Todd and others. Also shown is actress Jinx Falkenburg, one of the best players---men or women---in Hollywood. She looks as good playing tennis as she did in those slit-to-here gowns in those Columbia musicals she was in and, unlike her movies where her singing was dubbed, she requires no double when on the tennis court.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221924</url></doc>
