<plot>Jack, a lonely driver on a desert highway, runs out of gas. He encounters Woody, a tow truck driver who sends him down a dead-end that is the Black Road. Jack must then put his life in the hands of a series of characters that he just cannot seem to trust - for good reason, They lead him to a fate that Jack could never have suspected - a tongue-in-check send-up of a classic urban myth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073477</url></doc>
