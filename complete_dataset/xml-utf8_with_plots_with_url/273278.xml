<plot>Film biography of French comedian Jamel Debbouze. The camera follows Jamel for several months in the year 2001. We see him in most aspects of his life from professional work to the hectic home life of his large extended family. His brother Momo seems to act as his assistant and is also featured. During this time Jamel meets several famous French celebrities including Gérard Depardieu - who manages to paint a rather unsavoury image of himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273278</url></doc>
