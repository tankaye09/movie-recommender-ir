<plot>A series of "green" home makeover television specials created with the belief that celebrities can lead by example. The makeovers are hosted by Daisy Fuentes and designed by a supporting cast of energetic "Green Team" members including Eco Expert Simran Sethi, "Green" Interior Designer John Bruce, and Environmentalist Ryan Sutter. The team visits celebrity homes, demonstrating no less than 10 "Eco Tips" that viewers can repeat in their own homes to make a measurable impact on the environment. Information will be displayed in dynamic on-screen graphics with frequent website reminders where more in-depth information can be found. The EcoZone Project is just one element of a broader initiative, differentiating it from other "Green" television shows. EcoZone, a public-private partnership, brings together business and government to measurably improve the environment in local communities across the country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554826</url></doc>
