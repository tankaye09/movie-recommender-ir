<plot>A lazy office worker finds his world crumbling around him as he loses his job, his best friend, his girlfriend, his health and, ultimately, his sanity all in the course of 24 hours. For him, there's one thing to blame - the Happy People. Unwilling and unable to join in the fun around him, his efforts to confront the Happy People end in disaster, each greater than the one before.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?563442</url></doc>
