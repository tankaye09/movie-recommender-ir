<plot>In the land of cubicles and gaming software development hell, the most unhappy employee becomes the victim of video camera torture, pestered by the student filmmaker assigned to shoot the company promo. But after his chance encounter with a group of performance artists, he decides to assault the world's sensibilities as a performance artist himself. The only problem: he hasn't got an artistic soul, merely the desire to do it. So then, what is a non-art performance artist to do? The answer: he will return to college, and simulate the despair of his post-college disappointment for student audiences. But what makes this particular audience of college students unique is that, in reality, they are really and truly completely unaware of the fact that what they are watching is fake. They have no clue whatsoever that this dark, despairing, excruciating 'guest lecture' they are having to endure is actually an elaborate, fully-scripted bit of stealth theater.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208169</url></doc>
