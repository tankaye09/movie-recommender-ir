<plot>Zebedee is a seventy-five-year-old house cleaner who believes that life is precious. When he visits his next job, he is confronted by the messy house of a depressed and angry young man called Abe. Throughout the course of their conversation, they bond over mutual feelings of loss and disappointment. Zebedee finds out that Abe only has a couple of months to live and attempts to help him find some last shred of hope in his life. The offer of a small gift from Zebedee results in clarity for Abe and he returns the favor to Zebedee in a moment of pure selflessness and enlightenment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?515598</url></doc>
