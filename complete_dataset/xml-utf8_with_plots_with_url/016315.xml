<plot>A man sits on his bed in the solitude of his home, reflecting on his life. The man views himself evolving from child, to teenager, to adult. Like a city, this man's existence is complex and intricate. "Mother of God, do you love this city?" he wonders. After so many years of living, has this man found himself and his contribution to this world? Is just existing and living his prayer to god? A Song For Our Lady, based on the poem by Robert Lax, asks the profound question,"What does it mean to live?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016315</url></doc>
