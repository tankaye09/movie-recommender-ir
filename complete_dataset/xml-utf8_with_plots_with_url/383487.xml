<plot>The Kapoors have been living in Goa for several years, and are a well-known and respected family. Navin Kapoor is now retired, and lives with his wife, Anita, who has some Portugese blood, a sportsman son, Nikhil, and daughter, Anamika (Anu). Navin is thrilled to know that Nikhil has been selected for a sports scholarship and will be representing Goa in a national swimming championship. Before that could happen, Nikhil is asked by his coach to take a break and let some fresh youngsters take over; he is eventually dismissed from the team; Navin and Leena encounter hostile stares whenever they go out together; and Leena is shunned by her friends. Watch the climax as the Kapoors find out why the ground has been removed from under their feet, and if at all they are ready to accept the challenge together as a family or as embittered individuals who end up blaming each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383487</url></doc>
