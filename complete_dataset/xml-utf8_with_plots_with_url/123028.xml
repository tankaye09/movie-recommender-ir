<plot>Disarmament, Demobilisation, Reintegration. DDR is the name of the programme set up by the United Nations in Afghanistan in 2004 after thirty years of successive conflicts in this part of the world. This film aims to relate the application of this programme, on the spot, in its different phases, at the obligatory slow pace. This measure affects 100,000 Afghan soldiers, most of whom have never known any other occupation but war. They are now laying down arms, leaving the army, returning to civilian life and learning a trade. The film observes this process with a precision that makes it a rare document.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123028</url></doc>
