<plot>An explorer sets out through the dense jungle to track a mysterious and valuable artifact, unfortunately when he finds it he finds more than he bargained for as the reason the artifact has never been bought to public view before is that it controls the spirits of the dead, and the dead like it just where it is. So when he takes it from its grave like resting place, the spirits track him and hunt him down seeking their revenge and the return of their jewel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?443523</url></doc>
