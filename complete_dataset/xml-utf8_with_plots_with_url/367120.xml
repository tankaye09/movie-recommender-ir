<plot>A man awakens one morning to find himself incapable of leaving his room. Since he financially supports his parents and teenager sister, this is a problem. HIs abusive boss keeps appearing to insult him, as if he was still at work. His family feed him leftovers, hoping his health will return and he will go back to work. After a while, the family plots to get rid of the bedridden, rotting person in the room. "The Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka provides the ingredients to this pitch black comedy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?367120</url></doc>
