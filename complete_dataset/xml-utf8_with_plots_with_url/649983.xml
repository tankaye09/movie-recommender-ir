<plot>With its striking visuals and elegant satirical edge, WELCOME is a hypnotic essay set in an all too everyday world: a family, at the beginning of their day, in the unnatural calm of the all-American family home. Yet as the menial rotine proceeds, so this modern fable turns. WELCOME is not about what is seen; it is about the feelings which lay hidden beneath the surface, until the domestic landscape turns menancing forever. WELCOME has been praised for its innovative use of narrative imagery, as well as for an ending which is as shocking as it is hauntingly resonant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649983</url></doc>
