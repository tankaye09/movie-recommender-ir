<plot>Part machinima, part documentary, the video aims to give a glimpse at the mechanical nature of our virtual lives. Narrated from the point of view of my avatar on second life, a conceded old man, this short video critiques the practice of using dance pods on Second life as a means to earn linden dollars. Complaining about the lack of choreography and the time wasted, the narrator here views the dancing with contempt and offers a smattering of the expected advice. The act of a user patiently siting at this computer while watching his virtual avatar dance and earn money when viewed from an real world perspective, is a contrasting physical activity which requires further discussion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015933</url></doc>
