<plot>Scholars have identified more than 80 specific Old Testament prophecies that were fulfilled during the two days we now celebrate as the passion of Christ. Their implications are enormous, for they reveal that Jesus was not an unsuspecting victim. Instead, He died exactly in the manner God intended. The fulfillment of prophecy authenticates that Christ was, indeed, the promised Messiah. And Jesus said, "...all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled" (Luke 24:44). The Prophecies of the Passion-a 58-minute documentary-explores millennia of Biblical revelation and its fulfillment through the life and death of Jesus Christ. For those who already believe in the miracle of the Christ's death and resurrection, The Prophecies of the Passion provides a new source of insight, encouragement and confirmation of faith. For those who doubt, it is a powerful apologetic argument for the veracity of the Scriptures and the life of Christ.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446386</url></doc>
