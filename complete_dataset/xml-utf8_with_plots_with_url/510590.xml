<plot>An evil scientist (Overlord) invents a device that emits a radiation that controls the minds of the people within it's range. He gathers a sizable percentage of the Earth on his initial attack, and conventional forces cannot counter attack as they will also come under the power of the Zone if they enter. Earth's most powerful soldiers are united to combat the menace while wearing their Zone resistant suits. Each Zone generator is biological in nature and grows to full size and capacity in a matter of minutes. Earth's free forces are faced with the challenge of destroying the generators while resisting the Zone controlled forces, not to mention how easy it is to re-establish a control Zone. The good guys consist of 5 soldiers that are dropped into special missions by a Zone resistant plane. The Bad guys consist of about 6 guys that are specially treated by Overlord to be Zone resistant (They still show the red blemishes and retain them whether in or out of a Zone controlled area) while maintaining free will, and are supported by 'Zone Troopers' who wear a helmet that allows them to leave Zone controlled areas while remaining under Zone control.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510590</url></doc>
