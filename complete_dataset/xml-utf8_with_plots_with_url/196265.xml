<plot>Fish traps along the Columbia River. Poles are driven, a twine net is dropped into the water and raised sufficiently high on the sides so the fish cannot jump out during high tide. Then a lead, as it is called, is built out for a number of rods from the opening of the traps. When the fish strike this lead, which is also made of twine netting, they feel along for a clear passage, raising higher from the bottom until finally they drop into the mouth of the trap and are prisoners, until they are finally boated away to the canneries. This scene shows the fishermen taking them out of the traps into the boat. The salmon can be seen in the water as the fishermen gather them in. A most interesting subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196265</url></doc>
