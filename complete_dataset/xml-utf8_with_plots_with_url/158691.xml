<plot>Dr. Fritz Todt was the major architect of Hitler's extensive underground bunker systems. But he is most well known as the civil engineer that designed the Autobahn, a legacy that lives on to this day in Germany's famous national road systems. At the time of his death in 1942, Dr. Todt was actually one of the most powerful men in the Nazi Party. He was famous then for his design of fortification known as The West Wall, which this film shows in relation to the first battle Germany had against the country of France. This film features all the engineering project that Todt was involved with in the context of being a extremely influential member of the National Socialist Party.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158691</url></doc>
