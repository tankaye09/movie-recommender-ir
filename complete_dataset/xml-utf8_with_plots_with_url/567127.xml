<plot>Faced with his ailing, absentee father and his own paternal and marital shortcomings, James life is turned upside down on this trip to Echo Lake. This triptych mid-American family drama follows Jim, James and Jack Jensen through the birth and death of a misguided paternal legacy; literally left in the hands of an 8-year-old boy. Part One: Echo Lake was filmed as the 1st of 3 parts of this feature-length film. James confronts his father and his estranged wife Abby. What he learns on Echo Lake will have an affect on the rest of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567127</url></doc>
