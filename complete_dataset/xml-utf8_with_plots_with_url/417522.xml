<plot>Thomas Hart was recently sentenced to 15 years in prison for white-collar crimes. With the help of his two best friends, Hart spends his day making a video about his life. He does this so that his soon-to-be-born daughter, Mia  may know something about her father. As Hart's last free day winds down, we see him clash and come together with friends and family. He takes responsibility for his actions and ultimately gains a greater appreciation for his roots, even as they are about to be ripped out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417522</url></doc>
