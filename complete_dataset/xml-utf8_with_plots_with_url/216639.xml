<plot>During the early 1990s, "American Gladiators" was among the most popular game/competition series in syndication. "Gladiators 2000" was the children's version of the game. Two teams of two youths (one boy and one girl, ages 10-13) competed in modified American Gladiators-style stunts, with a gladiator from the adult series acting as an advisor (or adversary to the opposing team). Events, which rotated from week to week, included the Assault, the Wall, the Food Pyramid (the team members had to place cutouts of food items on the appropriate spot and scale to the top within a time limit), and the Slingshot. Teams earned points depending on how well they did. In between events, host Seacrest or his hostess (either Sansone or Redmond) posed health- and fitness-related questions to the team, with correct answers worth points. The final event was the Eliminator, an obstacle course that was modified from the adult version. The team that had the most points at the end won a prize.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216639</url></doc>
