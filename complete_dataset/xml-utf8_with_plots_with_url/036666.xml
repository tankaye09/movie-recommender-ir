Mark and Thomas have a master plan, to find Mark's son, James Anderson the love of his life once and for all. Meanwhile, Billy, a young gay teenager who has just turned 18 gets his first country kiss from his best friend Rick and is immediately caught and then thrown out of his house by his abusive father. With no place to turn, no cash and no contacts, Billy hitch hikes to the big city. Confused, lost and running scared, Billy soon finds a help wanted ad posted in a local city gay caf√© by James.

He quickly learns about full responsibility, independence, not to mention real life lessons about being gay. Billy unexpectedly finds himself in love with James and builds a bond with Mark that is unbreakable. "An Angel Named Billy" is a heartwarming, funny and unforgettable story of an abused boy who in leaving his life of hate and mistrust is able to come to terms in his own way of being gay in a modern world.
