<plot>What comes from our mouths as we work to pass though the uncomfortable silences? In a big city these two never thought they could become so isolated and alone with each other. This dark comedy about life, death and the persistence of time (or lack thereof) is an honest and funny look at the destructive stupidity of hormones and self-doubt in a new relationship. Take two stoners, mix in a bit of urban isolation and enough time to exercise their gray matter, what you get is something truly unique. A little serious, a little funny but awful awkward and a whole lot of fun.</plot><plot>What comes from our mouths as we work to pass though the uncomfortable silences?
