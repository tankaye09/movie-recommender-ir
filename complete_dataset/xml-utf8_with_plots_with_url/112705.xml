<plot>When his parents are hospitalized from a severe car crash, twenty year old Hector decides to leave the band he's been touring with for two years behind and take care of things at home. He's immediately thrown into a whirlwind of familial, romantic, and financial conflict. His younger brother and sister have surpassed rebellion, and the business his parents built is desperately waiting for a miracle. But some unexpected news from his former band mates may yet solve his problems at home. Before he can catch his breath, however, a romance ensues, and Hector is left making one of the biggest decisions of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112705</url></doc>
