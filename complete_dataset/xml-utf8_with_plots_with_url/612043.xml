<plot>"One of the big comedy hits of the Biograph. Scene: In the kitchen with old lady washing and old gentleman dozing by the fire. While his mother is out doors hanging up the clothes, Tommy ties a cord to the back of his father's chair, and attaches the other end to a towel in the washtub. His mother returns, puts the towel in the wringer, and as the cord tightens it pulls the old man's chair over, and as he falls with a crash he pulls the tub of water over and upon him. The scene is full of action and very amusing."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612043</url></doc>
