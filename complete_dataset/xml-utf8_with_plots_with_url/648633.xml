<plot>It's a film that talks about emotions and not events, whether for events we intend a series of facts. Something unexpected and revolutionary happens to the protagonists (Peter Mullan and Lorenza Indovina), but it's something intangible, indescribable throughout the traditional codes of language (from this, the absolute lack of dialogues in the film). That is because it touches a sphere that is not even comprise in the five senses, but it's part of a higher, or simply wider, way of feeling. If we would simplify the plot, we could say that it's a love story. In fact love is certainly the theme of this film, but that kind of love is intended as a special lightness that catches the two protagonists just because they are signed by experiences that, for long time, made them weigh down, imprisoned in microcosms of loneliness an anger. Love, then, as unexpected lightness that leads them to finally open themselves to life, the life that only now make them free.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648633</url></doc>
