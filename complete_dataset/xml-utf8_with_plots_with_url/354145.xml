<plot>April 18, 2007, Necati Aydin and Ugur Yuksel, two of the first Turkish Christian converts from Islam, along with Tilmann Geske, a German Christian living in Turkey, were tied up, tortured with butcher knives and murdered in their own office at a Christian publishing house in Malatya, Turkey. "Malatya" tells the story of these martyrs and how these deaths rocked the marginalized Turkish Christian community, as well as the families of the victims. Additionally, the film reveals the larger persecution against the Christians, why the hostility exists, and how the victims have responded to their persecutors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354145</url></doc>
