<plot>Earnest meant everything to Colleen. He was her older brother, her teacher, and her friend. But Earnest is dead. And all that remains of him is the burnt remnants of his bloodied right arm - found amidst a pointless war in a desert far away. Now, years later, and armed only with a camcorder and a band of quirky friends, Colleen is on attempt number 418 in recreating how she thinks her brother may have died. What did he see? What did he experience? And why does Colleen feel like she's running out of time to find these things out?...Make that attempt number 419.</plot><plot>Earnest meant everything to Colleen.
