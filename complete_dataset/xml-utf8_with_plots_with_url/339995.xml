<plot>When the subject, "Shooting the Chutes" is shown, as a rule, we see the cars coming down the incline and drop into the water. In order to show the public how the cars are loaded and unloaded, we made a special trip to Willow Grove, Philadelphia's leading park, where we took a picture of the "Chutes" there, and since its introduction it is acknowledged to be the best "Chute Film" yet made.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339995</url></doc>
