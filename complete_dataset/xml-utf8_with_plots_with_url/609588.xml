<plot>Tafdnar, a small fishing village near Agadir; one day seven years ago most of the men died at sea. And ever the place has been in a kind of trance. The women who lost their husbands, brothers and sons have never gotten over it. The village is nothing but sadness. the women need to find a way to keep living, but they have succumbed to a deep depression that is destroying them. Amghar, the headman of the village, is one of the very few men who are still alive. He is a notorious alcoholic, but, he, nevertheless, tries to preserve some sort of normality in the village. And there is also Daoud, a young man who dreams of going fishing on the open sea.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?609588</url></doc>
