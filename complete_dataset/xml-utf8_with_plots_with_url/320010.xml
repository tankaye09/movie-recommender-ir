<plot>A junior football tournament in an Argentine province. Proud parents Chato and Lopez are feeling a little nervous. The Capital's most important recruiters have come to look for new talent among the junior players. A contract with an important team is at stake - from there, many continue on to Europe, where they can earn millions. Shortly after the game, a Porteño scout declares to Chato and Lopez that their children aren't good enough, that neither of them have enough talent. The brains of one, combined with the legs of another, now that would be something! Chato and Lopez are depressed. But Lopez has an idea: talent is genetic, just as his mother-in-law says about the cows she raises, and she's right. So he proposes to Chato that they swap spouses to procreate. He with the wife of Chato, and vice-versa. After various doubts, and above all, thanks to their liberal thinking wives, they decide to take action. Of course, only under the strict supervision of his mother-in-law.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320010</url></doc>
