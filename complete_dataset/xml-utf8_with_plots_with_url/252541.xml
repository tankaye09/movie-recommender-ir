<plot>'Nancy Franklin' was so overwhelmed by the film _'I Know Where I'm Going!' (1945)_ (qv) that she traveled from New York to the Western Isles of Scotland to see the places where it was made and to find out more about the people who made it. This documentary retraces her steps on a subsequent visit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252541</url></doc>
