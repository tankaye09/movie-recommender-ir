<plot>Indigo is a film about loneliness, redemption, and the healing powers and grace of the new generation of Indigo (psychic and gifted) children being born into the world. Although the story is fictional, the emotions and actions of the film resonate with the spiritual dynamics of life today. The dramatic core of the film is the relationship that develops between a man whose life and family have dissolved due to a fateful mistake and his 10 year-old granddaughter with whom he goes on the run to protect her from a would-be kidnapper. Along the way, he discovers the power of his granddaughter's gifts which forever alter the lives of everyone she encounters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264455</url></doc>
