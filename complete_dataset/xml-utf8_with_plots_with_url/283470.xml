<plot>Despite her parents' objections, Kalpana Awasti (Juhi Chawla) continues to meet with Shekar (Uday Tikekar), and continues a romance with him, with a view of marrying him later. Shekar and Kalpana both study in the same college. Shekar wants to groom Kalpana to be the new president of the student body, to which Kalpana agrees. Kalpana is very popular in the college, and seems that the majority of votes will go in her favor. This does not auger well with the rival student body, which is headed by the son of Thakur (Sadashiv Amrapurkar). Kalpana is pressured to resign as head of her student union, to which she refuses. Even Shekar attempts to persuade Kalpana to step aside are in vain. Thereafter, the authorities receive a written letter resignation from Kalpana. Shekar is puzzled by this, and wants to contact Kalpana, but she is nowhere to be found. A friend of Shekar borrows his raincoat, and the next day his dead body is found in a subway. Politics heats up to such an extent, so as to threaten the entire community, the police are indecisive and reluctant to act, and no one seems safe anymore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283470</url></doc>
