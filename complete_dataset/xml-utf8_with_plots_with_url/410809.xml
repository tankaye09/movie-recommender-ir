<plot>Ranch life is difficult along the Arizona/Mexico border for Frank and Rosa Sojourner. Childless and struggling to find meaning in their marriage, they find themselves embroiled in the futile politics of illegal immigration. A recent rash of home invasions by predatory banditos has spiraled the local ranching community into paranoia and vigilantism. One day while patrolling his property, Frank stumbles upon a lone, immigrant boy and rescues him from certain death. Compelled to turn the boy over to Border Patrol, Frank is torn when Rosa becomes determined to keep the boy and nurse him back to health or even longer. But, the boy harbors a secret that will follow him to the ranch and force them all to confront a dark side of humanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410809</url></doc>
