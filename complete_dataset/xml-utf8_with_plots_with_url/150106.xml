<plot>In the 1950s, the "TV GUY" brought your new set home and tuned it for you. Then came the 1970s where we drifted into "plug and play" with the viewer doing all of the tuning. By the 1990s, component video was making its way into the home, and we released Video Essentials to help you get it right. Now it's time for the next generation, as home entertainment setup has evolved into Digital Video Essentials. The DVE calibration disc looks at system setup from the point of view of creating a canvas for works of electronic art. We've created NTSC, PAL and HDTV versions of DVE that provide a unified set of instructions and test patterns that work with all three formats. From acoustic and visual environment of a high quality system, to audio and video setup, Digital Video Essentials is the "TV Guy" of the 21st Century.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150106</url></doc>
