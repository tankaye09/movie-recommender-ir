<plot>It is said that in days gone by every schoolboy wanted to grow up to be a train driver. When the boy becomes the man and dreams of steam engines turn to the reality of the office, there is still a world of trains, tunnels and tracks to which we can escape - the world of the model railway. In this DVD we look at all aspects of this wonderful hobby from designing models and scenery to planning track layouts and painting kit engines. Railway modelling has something for everyone!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?373933</url></doc>
