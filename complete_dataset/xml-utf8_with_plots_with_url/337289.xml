<plot>The film consists of 8 sequences composed of 12 still photos each. Each photo stands for 5 seconds. The photos show models of landscapes made of artificial materials; wrapping paper, sparklers, kitty litter and such. Perceived as a whole, the photographic image gives the illusion of a natural environment, but when viewed in detail, this illusion crumbles and the synthetic nature of the arrangement becomes apparent. As in the picture, the sound shifts between the illusion of space and an abstract, musical reading. Recognizable sounds of nature (recordings of insects, wind, water and fire) are heavily edited, cut up, repeated, looped, pitched and transposed. "LINT LENT LAND" - the title can be read as a sentence or as a reflection of the film's time structure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337289</url></doc>
