<plot>It's Rigley's birthday. He's unhappy. It's night, raining hard, he's in his pajamas, and he's addressed a suicide note to his absent friend Trish. He says goodbye to Diana, his goldfish, the object of his true love. He runs a bath, in which he plans to slit his wrists. Then, the power goes out, and things get complicated: a broken aquarium, a makeshift abode for Diana, a visit from his nutty neighbor Mrs. Gideon, and a birthday phone call from Trish. Might all work out in the end?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060873</url></doc>
