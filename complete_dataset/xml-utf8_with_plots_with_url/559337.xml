<plot>A tenant farmer and his wife during the Depression count their last pennies. They are distant from each other and fall asleep, dreaming of better times only to be awakened by the frost warning. They rush outside and literally use the shirts off their backs to cover the small crop in hopes of saving their last meager plants from the impending frost. Once inside, the farmer, in a fit of frustration does something the has never done before - he smashes their last table and chair and uses it to build a fire to warm his wife. They turn to each other for warmth, from the cold and from the Depression.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559337</url></doc>
