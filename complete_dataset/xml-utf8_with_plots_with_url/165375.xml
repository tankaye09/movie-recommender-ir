<plot>Eddie Fisher, whose tumultuous personal life almost eclipsed his superb musicianship, delights us with some of his biggest and best songs, performed on live television during his heyday in the 1950s. Much more than just the handsome and charismatic husband of some of Hollywood's greatest beauties, Eddie Fisher was one of the most popular singers of his - or any - generation. No fan of pop music should be without this fabulous collection of easy-listening favorites. It's EDDIE FISHER SINGS THE HITS!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165375</url></doc>
