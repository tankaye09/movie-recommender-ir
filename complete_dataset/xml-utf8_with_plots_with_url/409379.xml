<plot>This geyser is one of the most celebrated and popular curiosities of the great National Park. It takes its name from the fact of its never failing to give an exhibition of its wonderful action every seventy minutes. As we see it here in the height of its action, sending immense volumes of steam and hot water hundreds of feet in the air, there to take on fanciful forms indescribable in words, it forms one of the most beautiful subjects every presented to a motion picture camera.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409379</url></doc>
