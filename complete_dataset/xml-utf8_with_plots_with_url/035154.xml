<plot>Activist, lover, visionary, renegade - For 75 years, Abe Osheroff fought on the front lines of social activism - from the battlefields of the Spanish Civil War to the killing fields of Nicaragua; from the witch hunts of McCarthy to the sharecroppers of Mississippi to streets all across the United States, Osheroff put his life on the line to keep justice alive. Through the unflinching lens of this documentary feature, this master storyteller takes us on an insightful journey inside the defining conflicts of 20th Century activism with irreverent humor and unwavering commitment to a lifetime of engagement. Osheroff's confessions strike a resounding chord in today's world with a singular voice that never stopped chanting "yes we can!"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035154</url></doc>
