<plot>Following in the long tradition of popular porn parodies such as "The Sopornos", "Brittany Rears", and "The DaVinci Load", "eXXXtra-eXXXtra" is a good-natured satire on the well-published, current scandals of Hollywood's bad girls Paris Hilton, Brittany Spears, Lindsay Lohan and others. As is well known, almost every popular movie and TV show has, at one time or another, been parodied in the adult industry. Using as its background a wild, surrealistic vision of one of the current crop of info/entertainment shows on the market, "eXXXtra-eXXXtra" follows the story of hard working, sexually naive, co-host Dana Divine as she fights to get the big interview that will save her job, and her career. Along the way she discovers her true self and finally uncovers her long-suppressed sensuality in a breathtaking on set sex scene at the end of the movie with the long-time object of her romantic daydreams, her handsome co-host Mark.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?673275</url></doc>
