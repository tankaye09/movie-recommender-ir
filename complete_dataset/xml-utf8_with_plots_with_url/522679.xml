<plot>Three female contestants one a champion competed. The champion was given two minutes and ran after her two opponents. Those two opponents were given one minute of base time and earned additional running time by answering a series of product-related questions (e.g., "What brand of soup uses the jingle, 'MMM, MMM, good?'" Answer Campbell's). When running around the supermarket selecting items, a maximum of five of a given item was counted toward the final score (e.g., five canned vegetables or five frozen waffles). Fleet-footed aides usually the produce boys at the supermarket where the show was taped that day helped load the shopping carts as each contestant scurried down the aisles. The contestant having the highest dollar value of groceries at the end of the show won her take and returned to compete the next day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522679</url></doc>
