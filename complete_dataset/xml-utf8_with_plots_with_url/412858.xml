<plot>One World follows eight students from a school in Birmingham as they embark on the journey of a lifetime to a rural village in Zambia. Despite coming from a challenging community in the UK the students are unaware of just how much they have compared to their Zambian counterparts. For two weeks they find themselves immersed in the African culture as they spend time with students from a nearby school, and discover what it is like to live and work in a developing nation. They soon realize that the difficulties they face back home do not even begin to compare with life in the third world. As their story is told through a series of on-location interviews it becomes apparent that this experience is one they will never forget. In a time of financial turmoil and social barriers, One World looks at whether friendships can really be built across the cultural divide, and if people can be genuinely happy in spite of their circumstances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412858</url></doc>
