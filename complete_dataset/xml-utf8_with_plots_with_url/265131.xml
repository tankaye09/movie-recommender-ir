<plot>After being introduced in Initial D's first season, the 'angels of Usui pass' were somewhat abandoned in the second season and the Third Stage movie. Extra Stage explains where Mako Satou and her co-driver Sayuki have been all along. Apparently during the events of Initial D: Second Stage, the Impact Blue team, had to battle a scouting party of the Emperors Team, despite all warnings by fellow racers Shingo and Takeshi of the nearby Night Kids team. Later, as winter sets in, and the events of Initial D: Third Stage are taking place in Akina, the Impact Blue girls take a vacation, and Mako gives love another try, but is constantly drawn towards her life as a drift-racer as well as haunted by the memories of her recent love, Iketani.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265131</url></doc>
