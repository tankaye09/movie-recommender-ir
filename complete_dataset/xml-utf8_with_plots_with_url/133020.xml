<plot>A failed scientist abducts five drifters, mentally conditions them according to his own ideals, and passes them off as clones to the science community. Confined within the walls of an Orwellian type setting, the drifters slowly begin to remember. Memories of their pasts seep into their present lives and raise questions of identity, plaguing their minds and co-existence with one another. The clash between authentic identities and constructed identities is one that leaves the drifters and scientist in peril.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133020</url></doc>
