<plot>Two small boys come to Dr. Bunion's office with a dead cat which they offer him for treatment. He drives them away, but they return and throw the cat into his hallway. Soon after, a patient limps in on crutches and raps on the doctor's door. The doctor, thinking the boys have returned, rushes out and assaults his patient with a club. The action throughout is very natural and humorous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014334</url></doc>
