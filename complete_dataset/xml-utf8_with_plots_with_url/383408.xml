<plot>My Bollywood Bride tells the story of Alex, a copy-writer dreaming of being an adventure novelist someday, who meets and romances Indian beauty Reena, while she is vacationing in California. Torn by her blossoming feelings for Alex and her Indian family values and obligations, Reena returns home without saying goodbye. Alex, distraught by the turn of events, decides to follow her to Mumbai and win her back. The trouble is, Alex couldn't be more out of his element on the sub-continent, not helped by the fact Reena has kept something very important about her from him (Reena is the top Bollywood film star - the Julia Roberts of India)! However, with the help of a rambunctious rickshaw driver and some of Reenas friends, Alex just might have a chance at winning her heart. A parallel love story centers on Bobby, an up-and-coming Bollywood star, who has forgotten his roots and started to believe his own press. As a close friend of Reena, he tries to help her by taking Alex under his wing. However, his life is thrown into turmoil when he runs into his childhood sweetheart Alisha, whom he once left behind after a dance competition in order to win a role in Bollywood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383408</url></doc>
