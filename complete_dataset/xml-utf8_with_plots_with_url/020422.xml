<plot>Due to his nefarious activities, Anjali Gulraj separates from Mahendra Pratap Gujral, and marries Dr. Malhotra. She does bring up her son, Dev from her first marriage, who grows up to become a Police Officer. Years later, on the tracks of Gujral, Dev, and his close colleague, Komal come across Suraj Singh, and find out that he is indeed Gujral. That's when Gujral decides to play on Dev's emotions by reminding of the past his affection for him, and blaming his entire criminal career on a politician, Rajvansh Shashtri. Dev must know decide to go after Shastri, or disbelieve his father altogether. But will his seniors permit Dev to arrest his own biological father, knowing Dev does have some affection for him, and will they ever permit a mere Police Officer to arrest a top politician?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020422</url></doc>
