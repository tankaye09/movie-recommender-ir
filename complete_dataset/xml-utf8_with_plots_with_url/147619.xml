<plot>Paul, shy, and not exactly what one would call a ladies man, checks his answering machine and gets a surprise message from a woman named Sandra. Great, except that he knows three Sandras: one he'd love to hear from, one he'd hate to hear from and a third he'd never expect to call him. Paul desperately wants to find out who is the woman who called and enlists the help of his close friend, who is a ladies man. Marc, though very busy himself and eager to pursue his business, agrees to help. And so begins an urgent investigation. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?147619</url></doc>
