<plot>Set in a crime-ravaged New York City, the Police cannot stop the street gangs. As a Vigilante, you must defend your people's turf! The Skinheads have taken Madonna, the queen of Pop, hostage. Now you must take the law into your own hands! There are five levels in all, each with an end-of-level baddie. Sometimes you can pick up some nun-chucks to beat-up the enemies instead of using your fists and feet. Some the baddies carry weapons like knives, clubs and guns. The final boss is incredibly difficult to beat because he slowly gains energy if you do not hit him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640396</url></doc>
