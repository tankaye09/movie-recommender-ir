<plot>Featuring rare film footage and interviews with director Youssef Chahine, legendary film star Amina Rizk and others, WOMEN WHO LOVED CINEMA, PART TWO chronicles the achievements of women filmmakers who helped shape the face of the Egyptian film industry from the 1930s to the 1960s. At a time when their country was steeped in conservative tradition, these strong-willed women broke cultural taboos and dismissed conventional wisdom to pursue their passion for filmmaking. WOMEN WHO LOVED CINEMA, PART TWO explores the work of Amina Mohamed, the independent director and star of TITA WONG (1937), an unusual film that chronicles the plight of a Chinese family living in Egypt. The documentary continues by examining the contributions of actress Marie Queenie as well as Assia Dagher, a Lebanese actress who gained Egyptian citizenship in 1933. Dagher then went on to produce over fifty Egyptian films, becoming one of the country's most influential producers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660081</url></doc>
