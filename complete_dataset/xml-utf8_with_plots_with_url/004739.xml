<plot>Many years ago, in Spruce Lake, a defiant farmer drowns when he refuses to leave his lands and a dam is built to flood and create a lake. In the present days, while traveling with the stripper Lucky for an important meeting with the banker Jerry Gold and the wealthy landlord Janet Sands, the unscrupulous Senator Wells runs out of gas and the couple is stranded in the Bed &amp; Breakfast owned by Bing. Meanwhile, Janet and Jerry are unable to cross a bridge over a flooded river and are advised to spend the night in the same B&amp;B. Together, they are invited to have a dinner in a nearby tavern by the hillbillies Junior and his sister Caro where there is a fight of three hunters and one of them is killed. Senator Wells is running the election to the White House and afraid of a scandal, he proposes the men to hide the body in the beginning of a tragic night.</plot><plot>Many years ago, in Spruce Lake, a defiant farmer drowns when he refuses to leave his lands and a dam is built to flood and create a lake.
