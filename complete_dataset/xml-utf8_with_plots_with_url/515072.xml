<plot>Stella is a 49-year-old Romanian woman living with her husband in a shanty town located under the Motorway 86, in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis, which runs alongside the Eurostar railway tracks. In order to survive, she goes everyday to the same Parisian metro station, sits herself on the stairs leading down to the tube and starts begging. The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital is one of the few places where she can have "normal" contact with French people. There, she has new teeth made, and so regains her dignity, despite everything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?515072</url></doc>
