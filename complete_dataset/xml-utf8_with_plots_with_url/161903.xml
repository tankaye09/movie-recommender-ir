<plot>Chanda lives a wealthy lifestyle in Jaipur along with her father, Thakur Dharam Singh, and mom. Since she is of marriageable age, her dad wants her to get married to a wealthy male of his choice, but she dislikes him. Arguments ensue at home and her dad slaps her, she falls down and passes out. When she regains her senses she finds herself in a hospital in Bombay with her dad at her bedside, who tells her that she was unconscious for 3 days, apologizes and promises never to pressurize her to get married. She forgives him and they return home. A few days later she gets a visitor, a male Akashwani singer by the name of Raj Kumar, who claims to be her husband, calls her by the name of Rekha, and wants her to accompany him back to Bombay where he lives in a Chawl along with a two-bit Bollywood actor, Bansi. The question remains who is this male, and why is he claiming to be Chanda's husband?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161903</url></doc>
