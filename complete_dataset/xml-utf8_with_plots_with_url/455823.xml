<plot>Depicts nominal 24 hours spent by the film crew inside the residence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, from the beginning of his day which starts at 3 am till sunset when the Buddhist leader goes to bed. The footage, by itself, is exclusive. But here, inside the residence, the documentary filmmaker Vitali Manski also got a chance to enjoy a totally informal conversation about the essence of the Universe and the role an individual has to play in religion in general and Buddhism in particular in the frameworks of contemporary society. This discussion is like a pitchfork for the enclosing part of the documentary, when the filmmakers are traveling back from India to Russia, through China.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?455823</url></doc>
