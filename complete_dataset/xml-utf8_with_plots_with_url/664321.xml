<plot>Man has been dumped by his ex-girlfriend Jenny. When he meets Jean he is finally able to forget Jenny, quoting a line about how they met on Valentine's Day and that it fell on the same day in both the Chinese and Western calendars. Their relationship builds wonderfully, until Jean's best friend Joyce comes back into Man's life. Joyce had fallen for Man earlier when he was a senior at university, and still harbors feelings for him. As Joyce starts to hint at how she feels, it begins to cause ripples in Man and Jean's relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664321</url></doc>
