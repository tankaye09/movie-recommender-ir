<plot>A poor widowed farmer, Dharma Singh, raises two children, a boy (Karan) and a girl (Geeta) on his own in a town called Rampur, and would like his son to grow up to be a police officer. Alas, that was not to be so, for heavy torrential rains strikes their region, separating the entire family, leaving Dharma wounded, and the two children ending up in a town called Sitapur. Geeta decides to work so that her brother can study. Her brother re-locates to Bombay city, and subsequently studies well, and becomes a Police Inspector. He is assigned his first major assignment to get rid of bandits near Sitapur, which he accepts, little knowing that the very people he is expected to get rid of are his very own sister, who is now a former jailbird, a notorious bandit who calls herself "Maut", and at odds with another bandit known as Daku Dharma Singh, who is none other than her father. Will Karan be able to fulfill his duties or will he end up joining his family in a life of crime.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499272</url></doc>
