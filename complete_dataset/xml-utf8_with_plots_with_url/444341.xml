<plot>Notorious Hollywood bad boy Darek Playto is captured by a mysterious Jailer while scouting a decrepit, abandoned prison for an upcoming film. Playto is a volatile visionary whose controversial reputation has earned him more than his fair share of enemies in the entertainment industry. In preparation for his upcoming feature film - a violent prison drama - Playto sets out to find the perfect surroundings in which to tell his brutal tale. Upon discovering a dilapidated prison that was once a notorious house of pain, it appears that Playto has found just such a location. But Playto isn't alone in this crumbling penitentiary, and upon being captured by the Jailer the director's only hope for escape is to answer a series of increasingly intimate questions concerning his art and his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?444341</url></doc>
