<plot>Thakur Dhanpath lives a wealthy lifestyle in a small village in India along with his wife, two daughters, and two sons. One of his son is a hunchback named Ranga. Dhanpath also has a younger brother, Narpath, both do not get along, so much so that Narpath takes over the estate and throws Dhanpath and his family out of the house. Forced to live in destitution, Dhanpath encourages the village folks to speak out against Narpath's oppression. As a result Narpath and four other men kill Dhanpath, his wife, molest and then kill his preteen daughter, as well as torture and kill his other daughter and son. Ranga manages to escape and with the help of a young girl named Ganga hides out in a cave. Years later Ranga and Ganga have grown up and have acquired magical powers bestowed on them by Bhagwan Shri Hanuman and Devi Maa Kali. They set out to hunt the killers down - only to find that they themselves have to fight each other, as Ranga is unable to fight his very own uncle and now grown-up cousin, Police Inspector Trilok.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209618</url></doc>
