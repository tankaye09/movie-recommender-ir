<plot>Gautam Chandra lives a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay along with his paternal aunt, Radha, is the Chair of the family business, and is in love with lovely Mayarani Sonachand, who he hopes to marry soon. Shortly after his 25th birthday when he goes to surprise Maya, he sees her in the arms of Gopal. Shocked, he drives his car home and runs over a young child, Anil Premchand, who happens to be the brother of Reporter/Advocate, Asha. He is subsequently arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to 15 days in jail and a fine of 200 Rupees. When he is discharged, he decides to make amends with Anil and Asha, with considerable success so much so that he and Asha fall in love with each other. Neither know that soon Gautam will be institutionalized in a mental hospital with little hope of ever being discharged.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?190239</url></doc>
