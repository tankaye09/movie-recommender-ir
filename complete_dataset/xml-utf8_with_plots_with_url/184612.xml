<plot>Everything's Coming My Way is the portrait of Gordon Thomas, an 87-year-old New York singer still hoping for his big break. Gordon is a former big-band trombonist, a born storyteller, and an artisan who makes all his own clothes with a needle and thread. His songs - catchy and simple, peculiar and personal - are a kind of musical folk art. This in-depth character study tells Gordon's life story and reveals the spiritual philosophies that have kept him going. The film also explores the long journey which led to his discovery, and the appeal of Gordon's strange and wonderful music, including the testimonials of Canadian and international GT fans.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184612</url></doc>
