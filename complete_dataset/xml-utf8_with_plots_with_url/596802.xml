<plot>The Translator is a suspenseful, harrowing, and deeply moving memoir of how one person has made a difference in the world - an on-the-ground account of one of the biggest stories of our time. Using his high school knowledge of languages as his weapon - while others around him were taking up arms - Daoud Hari has helped inform the world about Darfur.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596802</url></doc>
