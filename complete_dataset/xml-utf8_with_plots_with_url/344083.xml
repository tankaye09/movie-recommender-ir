<plot>The television series is loosely based on the film "Loufa kai paralagi" (1984) which covered the lives of the soldiers and officers involved in the first stages of development of Greek television. The first Greek television programs were produced by a station directly under the ownership, supervision and staffing of the Greek Army. Which was appropriate since the historic period of the events were the years of the Greek military dictatorship (1967 - 1974). Both the film and the series also examine the various effects of the dictatorship on Greek life both in and outside the army. But while the film was relatively short, the series further expands on the characters and their personal lifes and outlouks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344083</url></doc>
