<plot>A former Elite model reveals how the worlds of fashion, advertising and celebrity impact teens and young women. Who sets today's standards for beauty and how are these standards affecting our girls and society? Who is responsible? Are there ways this can be changed? If so, who can/will change it? Startling interviews with fashion editors from Teen Vogue and ELLE magazine. Intimate interviews with top agents, designers, models and many more. An important issue covered is the sexualization of young girls in the media/advertising.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117213</url></doc>
