<plot>For My Father serves as an apology from John Ibbitson to his father, Alan, for years of misunderstanding and mis-communication between the two. John believed that his father neglected him, but Alan is actually mentally challenged. The film determines that there is no blame to be leveled for John's mistreatment as a child. For My Father explores the reasons for their circumstances. John's narration delves into his own fear of becoming like his parents, but realizes that this is unrealistic, considering that his father's character is largely a result of an early childhood accident. The neglect John experienced was a result of this. The film reveals John's character as he explains why he was once troubled by his relationship with his father, but has now come to accept his father for who he is and hopes to initiate a father and son relationship that they never had.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199844</url></doc>
