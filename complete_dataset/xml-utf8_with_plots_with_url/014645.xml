<plot>For 65 years people of a certain age in New Orleans have danced to the music of Pat Barberot. We meet these characters in May 2004 at his nightclub. Through them we learn a little bit more about what's truly precious in life. Very few talk about the job they once held or the size home in which they lived. Instead they talk about relationships and love. Then Hurricane Katrina hits. The people we've followed for 18 months are suddenly scattered across the Southeast. They lose homes, friends, and their dance hall. There's a deep sadness, but also grace and unexpected humor as they work to piece things back together. And of course, they find a way to dance again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014645</url></doc>
