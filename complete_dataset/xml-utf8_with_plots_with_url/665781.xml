<plot>Yoga Flow is a full and balanced Vini Yoga workout session led by Lynn Paula. Vini Yoga emphasizes stability and fluidity rather then forcing oneself into contorted positions. Since each person is different, it takes into consideration the individuals structure and condition, giving maximum benefits with minimum risks. It respects individual needs by appropriate application of postures, breath, meditation and relaxation. Vini Yoga is particularly suited to learning at home, since it offers variations for many of the exercises so that each student can comfortably and safely reach his or her own level, while still gaining all of yogas benefits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?665781</url></doc>
