<plot>He was a beloved American icon. Dean Martin, the coolest, the most debonair, the smoothest. This film is a loving and moving tribute to one of the most admired, idolized and accomplished entertainers the world has ever known. No other entertainer in history so thoroughly conquered the fields of recording, live performances, television and movies as did Dino, not even his good friend Frank Sinatra. Features footage and photos of Dean from throughout his life and career, as well as rare interview segments with Dean.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133594</url></doc>
