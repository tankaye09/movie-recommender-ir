<plot>A devout but a very naive Muslim youth Banne (Ashish Kaul) leaves his home-land to go to the City to live with Shakeel (vikas Anand), and his beautiful daughter Sabha (Juni). He expects to be pampered as he has been at his home, and Shakeel and Sabha do their best to make him feel at home. He and Sabha slowly get attracted to each other. He is a talented singer, and soon his talents are discovered by Titlibai (Himani Shivpuri), who invites him to live with her and her daughter, Sahida (Rubaina Khan), and he does so. He is easily impressed by the attentions bestowed on him by Titlibai and the beauty of Sahida, who he is told he will marry soon, leaving poor Sabha heart-broken. He can only marry Sahida after he seeks approval from Titlibai, who, though very agreeable and friendly, has an agenda of her own, which will change Banne's life and outlook forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025006</url></doc>
