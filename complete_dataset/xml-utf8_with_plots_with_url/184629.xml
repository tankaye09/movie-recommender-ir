<plot>Filmmaker Abraham Ravett attempts to reconcile issues in his life as the child of a Holocaust survivor in this experimental non-narrative film. Ravett reflects upon his relationships with his family, from his now-deceased father (who survived both the Lodz Ghetto and Auschwitz) to his own young children. He utilizes family photographs and film footage, archival film footage from the Ghetto Fighters' House in Israel, cell animation by Emily Hubley, and computer graphics to create a film about memory, death, and what critic Bruce Jenkins calls "the power of the photographic image and sound to resurrect the past."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184629</url></doc>
