<plot>Walter Matthau's co-stars, friends and family share stories and behind-the-scenes insights into what he was like off-camera. Matthau's passion for classical music, horse-racing, gambling and sports are explored. The documentary is full of film clips and photographs of Matthau's personal life and career as well as interviews with friends, family and colleagues. Co-stars Dyan Cannon, Brent Spiner, Kevin Pollak, Mason Gamble, Piper Laurie and Richard Benjamin are interviewed. Longtime pal Jack Lemmon looks back on their four decades of friendship and creative collaborations. Conductor Zubin Mehta and classical music host Tom Dixon talk about Matthau's surprisingly in-depth knowledge of Mozart. Writer Neil Simon and actor Richard Benjamin recall what it was like to see Matthau's meteoric rise on Broadway and his famously riveting live performances as "Oscar Madison" in The Odd Couple. Matthau's son Charlie shares a look at Walter's surprising personal life - including his refined taste in music and the arts, his gambling addiction and a long and courageous battle with multiple life-threatening illnesses. Everyone has a favorite funny memory to share, and lots of gambling tales, but what family and friends seem to remember most is Matthau's enormous capacity for love and friendship. On the silver screen, Matthau was everyone's favorite uncle, grandfather, dad or buddy - and it turns out that in life, he actually was.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243366</url></doc>
