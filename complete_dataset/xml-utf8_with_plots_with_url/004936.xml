<plot>Adam uses sign language in a deserted landscape. Apparently institutionalized, he functions like an automaton, shaving, brushing his teeth, eating and sleeping. Two crazed, unscrupulous nurses feed him pills. He sits at the end of a hospital corridor, sunflower in hand, dressed and prepared for some unknown purpose. He wakes on the roof of a building and wanders by a riverbank apparently disturbed by some painful memory. In a red room he lies rigid on a bed.</plot><plot>Adam uses sign language in a deserted landscape.
