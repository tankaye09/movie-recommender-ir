<plot>After a gruelling week filming in London, actor Joseph Lockhart takes the train home to Brighton, to relax and recharge. Instead, however, after discovering a dead body on the beach clutching a photo, his time spirals into a journey of surreal consequences and ultimate fate. Joe's obsessive quest to discover the identity of the dead body leads him to encounter a mysterious girl, who he convinces himself is connected to the murder on the beach. He assumes the role of detective, solving his own clues and gradually unlocking the blind spot in his own soul, resulting in the brutal revelation of the truth about an incident from his past he thought he had long-since concluded.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544631</url></doc>
