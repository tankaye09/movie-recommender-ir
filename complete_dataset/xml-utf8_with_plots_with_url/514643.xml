<plot>This documentary film explores the desires, expectations, and myths of relationships. It juxtaposes a 38-year-old NYC woman who fears that she may be "destined to be single" and a married couple whose relationship has changed dramatically since having children and moving to the suburbs. While the NYC woman actively seeks finding the perfect mate and marriage, the married couple struggles to cope with daily realities of married life and parenthood. The film also presents many anonymous New Yorkers offering opinions and questions regarding love and its many myths.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514643</url></doc>
