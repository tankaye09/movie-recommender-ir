<plot>Several students from Freddi's film studies class are sitting around a table complaining about her course. "Why can't she just let us enjoy the films?" one of them says. As another says "Freddi's sexy!" Lights flash and things fall about in the house. They go outside to discover a spacecraft, a cardboard door upon which opens to reveal several green slimy creatures armed with guns firing red laser beams. How can they stop the slugs?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214596</url></doc>
