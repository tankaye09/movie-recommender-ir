<plot>Set as a film within a film, or a film about a film being made, this psychological drama weaves in mystical themes with themes of the mystery of creating a work of art. The film that is being made is based on Pär Lagerkvist's novel "Barabbas." Barabbas was the criminal crucified along side of Jesus that was chosen by the Isrealites to be pardoned instead of Jesus. The problem is that the director of the film cannot find anyone to play the role of Jesus, until someone suggests a man from a local clinic for the mentally retarded. At the clinic, this man is regarded as a real Messiah and holy teacher. When he arrives on set, he immediately creates an uproar and the effect is that he reveals all the evil going on in and around the set itself. He is repulsed by the idea that people who have no faith themselves, would dare to try to make a film about Christ, and as such, he takes up the cross on the set and drags it through the streets of Yeveran, back to the clinic, where he insists that he be crucified for real...will they do it??</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290377</url></doc>
