<plot>A professional facial contortionist is seen in the beginning of the film. Like a flash of lightning his face changes into a comical looking French soldier, from that to an Irish policeman, then to a clown. Next appears a hideous picture of an old maid, and after that an old man with a most comical face; then comes the head of Mephistopheles, and next a foolish boy with protruding teeth; next a most hideous version of the negro, and finally an old man with a nightcap, who yawns very ludicrously; next comes an old maid who is slightly cross-eyed, and finally a dunce of a country schoolhouse, who ends the picture by sticking out his tongue in such a manner as to give any audience the appearance of having indulged in laughing gas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336314</url></doc>
