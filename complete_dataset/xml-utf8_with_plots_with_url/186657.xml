<plot>Sexuality, reality and sensual dreams intermingle and drift through Laura's existence with such frequency and intensity that she develops an irresistible urge to fall into deep, erotic daydreams any time and any place. Alarmed, her husband calls in a doctor. The M.D. resembles one of her dream lovers and during the examination, she falls into her sultry fantasy world with another dreamlike state manifesting itself. She ends up at an erotic film shooting with Laura center stage. As the cameras begin to roll, she envisions her husband, the doctor, and her co-workers, all engaging her in decadent sexual activities. Where does reality stop and imagination begin?
