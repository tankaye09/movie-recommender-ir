<plot>Marian's life has come to an end, or at least her family thinks so. In the final stage of her life, Marian finds herself being admitted to a nursing home. Reluctantly accompanied by her family, the surreal event forces Marian to relive an incident from her past. A moment she has spent a lifetime trying to forget, a terrible memory that takes to her childhood, a time when she was a young, naive girl who was oblivious to the world and its cruelties. Yet, one spring day she was changed forever, changed with one simple visit, a visit of charity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017865</url></doc>
