<plot>The newspaper columnist 'Mr. Inquisitive' calls people at random and asks them "What would you like to do?" The answers are printed in his column, and the person is eligible for a prize. He just happens to call several contemporary popular entertainers (all of whom perform), including singer Vera Van; the leader of Lester Cole and His Texas Rangers, a country &amp; western singing group; and the male half of Rosita &amp; Fontana, a ballroom dancing duo. Also featured are The Heat Waves, a trio of jazz singers/tap dancers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254935</url></doc>
