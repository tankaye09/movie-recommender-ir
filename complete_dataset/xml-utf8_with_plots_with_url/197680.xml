<plot>Mod is a slow-witted thug who's trying to turn his life around. He recites the self-help platitudes plastered around his apartment on post-it notes, listens to classical music, and studies for his GED. He takes one more debt collection job, but when the debtor doesn't have all the money, he reluctantly accepts a seemingly mute abused woman as temporary payment. Although he's not happy about having her around, he treats her kindly. When he begins to realize all the different ways that she has been abused and neglected, he starts to care more for her welfare than for the rest of the money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197680</url></doc>
