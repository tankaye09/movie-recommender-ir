<plot>Popeye is doing a great job of sinking Japanese ships (complete with toilet-flush sound effect). A carrier pigeon brings him notice that he's been granted a month furlough, which he plans to spend with Olive and his nephews. But on arrival, he's run over by Olive, who immediately leaves him alone with his nephews, who are practicing home defense. Popeye falls for their booby-trapped hammock, and also barely survives the demonstrations of their other skills, notably camouflage. He ends up in a beehive; the displaced bees take up residence in a gas mask, which a nephew slaps on Popeye; the bees then manage to fly Popeye all through the house, then drop him on the ground, where his nephews bandage him all too thoroughly. That's enough for Popeye, who heads back to the front; the pigeon tries to deliver notice of an extra two weeks, but Popeye will have none of it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011861</url></doc>
