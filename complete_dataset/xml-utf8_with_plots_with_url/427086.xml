<plot>One of the founders of Earth Day, Ira Einhorn was a leading light of counter-culture in the '60s. But his arrest in 1977 for the murder of his girlfriend transformed the hippie activist into a fugitive from justice. After powerful allies including current Senator Arlen Spector secured his release from prison before his trial Einhorn fled the country. For twenty years he eluded the authorities. Finally, in 1997, he was arrested but not jailed in France. Despite extradition arrangements between France and the U.S. and the fact that he was convicted of the crime in absentia, he remained a free man. It is a story that fascinates as it enrages, an undeniable and monstrous miscarriage of justice accomplished only through the direct help of those in power. It is a case that asks if justice is truly possible in the world we live in</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427086</url></doc>
