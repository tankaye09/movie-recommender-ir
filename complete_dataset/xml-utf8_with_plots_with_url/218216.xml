<plot>The Intelligence Service looking to increase its budget by staging a Terrorist Attack in the capital. In that way, they can attract attention to their cause by creating panic within the population and thereby receive more funding from the Government. To achieve this, a secret cell within the Intelligence Service places an advert in a newspaper to hire a man who can conduct an undercover operation. Unfortunately, an enthusiastic and naive young man applies without realising what is going to happen to him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218216</url></doc>
