<plot>A portrait of a holocaust survivor who learned the art of tailoring while imprisoned in a concentration camp. After being liberated and emigrating to America, Martin Greenfield rose from floor boy, to manager, to owner of a garment factory producing custom men's suits in Brooklyn, NY. Along the way he made suits for celebrities, power brokers, and heads of state, including presidents Bill Clinton and Dwight Eisenhower. His sense of style brought him success and allowed him to give back to the city that took him in as a young man. He now provides jobs for hundreds of working class people, most of them immigrants, and produces top quality clothing the old-fashioned way. This film tells his story, and offers a glimpse inside one of the few remaining hand-made suit factories in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333155</url></doc>
