<plot>This beautiful subject shows a panorama of the Woodside Trolley situated in the heart of the beautiful Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, taken in the month of June when the flowers are in bloom. The picture presents nature in all its grandeur. The trolley winds in and out of curves of trees where thousands of persons visit almost daily during the summer months, and many young persons congregate on pleasure bent. We recommend this exceedingly interesting subject to all who admire nature.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660534</url></doc>
