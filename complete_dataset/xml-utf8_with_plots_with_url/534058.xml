<plot>So as not to Forget A film about the force of memories. Memories make a person into what he or she is, but what happens if you are engaged in a wrestling match with your memories? So as not to forget follows four people in the struggle with their memories. An Iraqi artist had to fight in the trenches of the war against Iran for 8 years. To ward off madness he used to draw, day in day out. Now, in the Netherlands, he is up against the stress of exile and paints the memories of his native town, memories he is so keen to pass on to his children. Old age is keeping a strong, elderly woman locked up in the midst of an incredible wealth of memories; but she has no one to pass them onto. Her tangible memories, will soon have to go, too. A man who lives in a nursing home is faced with the loss of his memory, a process he can do nothing about. Through reminiscence therapy people try to restore to story of his life, hoping to help him rediscover part of his crumbling identity. A few stages on in this process is a woman who does not even recognize herself in the mirror, but entrusts all her love and inner richness to a plastic doll. Leo Divendal, the photographer, welds the various stories together to a larger narrative that tells us about the collective consciousness. So as not to forget is a poetic film about the force and the power of memories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?534058</url></doc>
