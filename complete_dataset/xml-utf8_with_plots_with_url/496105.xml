<plot>"Sides" The Boston-based Feature Length drama opens with a panorama of the diverse Boston architecture at night, reflecting a rippling mirror image on the Charles River. A view of Memorial Drive moves to Storrow, gliding around the harbor to Back Bay and finally resting at the colorful lights of the North End waterfront, where the sky is slowly illuminating with the glow of dawn. Al (Aly) Gianetti, a traditional Italian man approaching middle age, lies sleeping with his beautiful live-in girlfriend Gianna. As they softly awaken, their deep loving rest will soon be replaced with the frantic routine of Al's chosen career path. Al, an intense, bohemian actor with a brash, sarcastic sense of humor, is rushing out the door to attend a casting call where he will meet Cinthia (Cin). Meanwhile, we parallel the hurried preparations of Cin leaving her home for the same casting call. A pretty, well-organized, 30-something formally trained stage actress, Cinthia juggles her baby in one arm and her script in the other while bickering with her husband in this typical morning scene. Al introduces himself to Cinthia in the casting company waiting room, and despite their polar-opposite backgrounds and personalities, they are quickly drawn to each other. They begin to spend more time together, and in sharing common career goals and opening doors within themselves, the two strengthen their kinship as struggling actors in Boston. Long conversations and secret trysts, severe clashes and moments of undeniable chemistry reveal the complimentary nature of the two actors, both finding a passion in this relationship that is missing in their normal lives. At home, Al is the divorced father of 16-year-old Annalisa, who in her teenage vulnerability has fallen into a relationship with local street thug Tonio. Al constantly worries about his daughter, who is spending more and more time with Tonio and his gang. Additionally, there is a void growing between Al and Gianna, as she senses that he is becoming distracted and distant. Similar feelings of worry and mistrust can be found at Cinthia's house. Cin's husband Ben continues to express his disapproval of the unpredictable and unreliable lifestyle that her career has forced upon her, and their three-year-old daughter Brittney rarely sees her mother anymore. Each of these conflicts is unwittingly reinforced by Al and Cin's behavior, all of the emotional ups and downs rapidly escalating in raging intensity. In the end, both must accept the responsibility of making a choice that may be acceptable, but is difficult and vague of heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496105</url></doc>
