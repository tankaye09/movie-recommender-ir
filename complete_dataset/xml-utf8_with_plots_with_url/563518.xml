<plot>Football was born on the streets of England hundreds of years ago. Known as Mob Football, the residents of Ashbourne consider this yearly event more important than the World Cup. The village is divided in Up'ards and Down'ards, desperate to score at goals three miles apart and in an icy cold river. It's a tough game where scoring takes a lot more than fancy footwork. This is Mass Street Football with only one official rule, 'no murder'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?563518</url></doc>
