<plot>Phillip Lauder is an attractive, successful billionaire software developer. While at an industry conference, he meets Allison Conner, who he develops a strong attraction to. Allison is intrigued by Phillip and soon they fall in love. Allison is unsure of the whirlwind romance, but continues to see Phillip. Meeting Phillip for a lunch date, Allison soon discovers that Phillip has left. Hurt and disappointed Allison starts to leave only to see Phillip returning, he proposes and Allison accepts. Upon arrival at Phillip's mansion, Allison is reassured that it is now her home. As Phillip introduces Allison to his sister, Tonya, Allison notices the possessiveness his sister has over both the mansion and her brother. Before leaving for work, Phillip asks Allison to always trust him, and to remember she is a target. When the security chief briefs Allison on the security measures, it is then Allison learns how Phillip's wife died, she was kidnapped, and though ransom demands were met, she was killed. Hearing the whispers of the staff, and an abrupt visit by the FBI agent who headed the investigation into Phillip's wife's kidnapping, Allison begins to dig into Phillip's past. The more she learns the more she begins to suspect, there is more to Phillip's past than she expected. Undaunted, Allison prods further, but will she be prepared for the truth?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339373</url></doc>
