<plot>Joseph, a young gay male, finds himself the random target of a hate crime and is severely beaten. Joseph retreats into his own world and loses all faith upon hearing that he has permanently lost sight in one eye. In a loving, albeit misguided attempt to help Joseph reclaim his life, Joseph's mother Rachel and best friend Derrick present him with a very unexpected present for his birthday, a face-to-face encounter with his attacker and a chance for revenge. Realizing that he is not filled with the same hate, Joseph spares the life of his attacker, but justice is served when, in an ironic final twist of fate, the attacker becomes the victim of his own senseless act of hatred and violence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037114</url></doc>
