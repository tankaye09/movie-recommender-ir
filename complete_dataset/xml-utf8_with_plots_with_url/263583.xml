<plot>The Rhine River valley is showcased, focusing on sights in the valley. Cities along the Rhine include Cologne, where the magnificent Cathedral of Cologne stands, a structure missed by the bombs of the wars; and Bonn, the seat of government and the birthplace of 'Ludwig van Beethoven' (qv). Another composer associated with the Rhine is 'Richard Wagner (I)' (qv) who based many of his compositions on lores of the valley. A chief industry in the valley is wine making, vineyards dotted among the agricultural lands of the valley. And the river itself serves the functional purpose as a transportation route both for pleasure and for shipping.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263583</url></doc>
