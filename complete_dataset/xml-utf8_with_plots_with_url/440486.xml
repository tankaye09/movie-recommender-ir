<plot>Vincent Van Gogh remains the ultimate example of the tortured artistic genius. His whole life was a struggle against poverty, loneliness and mental disorder. In a feverish spell of painting prior to his death, Vincent Van Gogh proved himself a great artist. The hundreds of canvases that he painted in the South of France are now recognized as masterpieces of the Post-Impressionist age. His use of thick, swirling color was a conscious attempt to express his own tortured state of mind through his work. In his landscapes, still-lifes and portraits, he succeeded. Though he sold just one painting in his lifetime, works such as "Sunflowers" now sell for tens of millions of dollars.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?440486</url></doc>
