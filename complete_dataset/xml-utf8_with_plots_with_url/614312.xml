<plot>Touching is a short film shot in the Catskill Mountains that tells of the relationship between two strangers: a young boy and the body of a middle-aged woman. The boy comes across the corpse, which is propped up against a stonewall, while playing in the woods. Instead of telling his father about the dead woman, he keeps his discovery to himself, and secretly revisits the body several times in order to indulge his curiosity. The story is told through a series of silent vignettes. Significant jumps in time suggest a fuller world than we're being let in on. The film shifts between the boy's restless perspective and the lifeless gaze of the dead woman, never allowing the viewer the comfort of a consistent point of view. During his second visit the boy makes an impulsive and fateful choice that leaves him troubled and shaken. His only option then is to return to the forest for reconciliation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?614312</url></doc>
