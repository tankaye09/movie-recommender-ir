<plot>This is a real funny one. Biddy hands Pat a basin of water, and while Pat washes himself she takes a pull on the black bottle. They have but one chair between them, and decide to occupy it by overturning it and using it as a couch. Pat sits on the back and Biddy on the legs. Biddy enjoys a funny story Pat tells her and she jumps to her feet and Pat and the chair topple over. He rises and turns the chair, thinking his companion does not see him, and they reseat themselves and resume their conversation. Pat rises suddenly, expecting to see Biddy fall, but she rises with him and they repeat this two or three times. Pat gives up in despair and reseats himself, but Biddy unobserved by Pat has turned the chair again, and as soon as he is comfortably seated she rises and he is again thrown to the floor. An exceedingly funny picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603584</url></doc>
