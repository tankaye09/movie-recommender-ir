<plot>Baby Lund is admittedly the most talented child artist of the stage at the present time. She has been carefully trained and her representation is most pleasing. During the course of this dance the little lady gives six different impersonations with six different costumes, all of which are shown in this film. A most interesting and enjoyable motion picture, always favorably received by the parents in the audience, particularly clear and bright, and a winner every time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054719</url></doc>
