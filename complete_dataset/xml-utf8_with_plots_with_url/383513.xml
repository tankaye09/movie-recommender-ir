<plot>My mother was in the early stages of this cruel, mind-wasting illness, Alzheimer's Disease, when she was lost for 3 days and 3 nights. The devastation of it all led me to make this documentary with the hope of promoting awareness and more research toward finding a cure and offering hope to others. I plan to continue this story in a feature film revealing how Alzheimer's robs one of that person one loves, like no other disease, and how the family is affected. Alzheimer's afflicts over 4.5 million Americans, it's the 4th leading cause of death among adults. It is estimated that the number of victims will grow to 7.7 million Americans by 2030, and 13-16 million by 2050. Call for help and information: the Alzheimer's Association of L.A. (800) 660-1993. Take time out to care....it could happen to someone you love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383513</url></doc>
