<plot>Originally presented as part of the acclaimed anthology film Tel Aviv Stories, this short fiction satire addresses one of the most difficult and serious issues facing Israeli women today. When a policewoman suddenly recognizes her husband who has been AWOL for years, she takes an odd assortment of local onlookers hostage, threatening to kill them if she is not issued a divorce immediately. Anat Waxman gives one of her strongest performances in this unusual look at the conflict between religious law and modern Jewish life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213223</url></doc>
