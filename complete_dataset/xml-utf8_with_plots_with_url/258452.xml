<plot>Italy, two strangers meet across a narrow courtyard bursting with life. He's married, on a tour with his wife. The mystery woman lives in the building adjoining their hotel. Their eyes meet -- and that's all. Their eyes meet several times. Passions grow, at a distance. While constantly staying in their hotel room, the wife pleads for her husband's attention. Leaves in a breeze, the texture of a stucco wall, a beautiful woman simply looking out a window and the connections begins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?258452</url></doc>
