<plot>Episode 1 - "Swimming With Giants" Every year hundreds of Humpback Whales migrate south from the North Atlantic Ocean to spend winter in the warmer waters of Silver Bank, just to the north-east of the Dominican Republic. At the Silver Bank Marine Preserve, the Quest team have recorded courtship behaviour, parenting and territorial battles of Humpbacks gathered there for the calving season. Silver Bank presented a rare opportunity for the Quest team and scientists to interact at close range with these Humpback communities, revealing a spectacular array of unique behaviour. In this episode we have also documented the intimate bond between mother and calf and witnessed other rarely seen underwater behaviour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024336</url></doc>
