<plot>On a shady lawn several young ladies and a colored nurse are seated on a bench. Two little tots are playing in the grass. Happy Hooligan looms up and sees a chance for a little flirtation. After brushing his rags with his feather duster he seats himself on the bench. The nurse girl immediately seizes the children and flies for protection to a policeman, who is seen in the background. Hooligan slides along the bench towards the young ladies. Both beat a hasty retreat. Hooligan is now in full possession of the bench. He stretches himself at full length, curls his feet over the back, and prepares to enjoy a refreshing sleep. His dreams are rudely dispelled by the policeman, who whacks the soles of his feet with his club. A lively chase around the bench follows, with Hooligan in the lead, but ends in ignominious capture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245187</url></doc>
