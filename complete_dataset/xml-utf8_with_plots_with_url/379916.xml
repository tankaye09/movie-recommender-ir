<plot>Mr. Nobody Holme has a jitney that won't start. He's cold, his back hurts, and he even cries. While the little fellows "Joy" and "Gloom" have a small shoot-out, Holme builds a small bomb that shoots the car through the roof. But at least it's running!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379916</url></doc>
