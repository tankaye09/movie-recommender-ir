<plot>When the picture is first seen a young man is seen courting his girl who is about 20 summers. They appear to be exceedingly fond of each other as is evidenced by their actions. The film then changes and we see the pair 40 years after, still billing and cooing, as they did years before. A very good subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345295</url></doc>
