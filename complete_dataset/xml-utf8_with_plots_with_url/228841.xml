<plot>Chris is a Saint who's no longer wanted. As the Patron Saint of Travel, he was kicked out of the Catholic canon but refuses to go away. The man who can get you anywhere still knows where the best Thai is and still wants to help. In upstate New York, the land of Route 9's, he finds a gas station attendant with an excellent sense of direction but nowhere to go. Denton doesn't want any help. Frustrated and worried by having to justify his very existence for the first time, Chris is determined to prove they have more in common than Denton thinks. Chris will bend time and space to show the exotic world is not so far away: you can get there from here. There may even be dancing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?228841</url></doc>
