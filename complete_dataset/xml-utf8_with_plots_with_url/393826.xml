<plot>The life and work of 90 year old Peggy Lipschutz. Peggy is an artist, book illustrator, political activist, labor unionist, feminist, pacifist, humanist. She pioneered the "chalk-talk"- a performance art form combining drawing and music before a live audience. This film explores Peggy's unwavering commitment to art, peace and social change. The goal of this half hour film is not only to celebrate the life and work of this unique woman but to use Peggy's life-long commitment to art and social change as inspiration for the next generation. We hope that a new generation of artists and activists will learn and carry on Peggy's important work for peace and justice. We use archival material and existing film footage, conversations with Peggy, as well as contemporary interviews with some of Peggy's colleagues, family and friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393826</url></doc>
