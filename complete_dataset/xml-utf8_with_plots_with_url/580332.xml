<plot>There once was hero who wasn't a hero. Tall he was not nor brave nor strong. He only had one arm, and his life meant almost nothing at all. Then one day war came to his kingdom, and in the ruins of the day he was made to seem a hero. Thus a new journey began for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580332</url></doc>
