<plot>At Rocking The Boat, an after school program in the Bronx, high school students learn how to build a boat using their hands. This cinema verite documentary follows a group of students through the boatbuilding process from the very moment they learn to use the tools to the boat's completion several months later. Along the way, the students not only create something beautiful, but they also gain practical skills, form new friendships, and have fun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350997</url></doc>
