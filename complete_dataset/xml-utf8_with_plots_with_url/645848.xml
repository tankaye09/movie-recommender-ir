<plot>When fire fighter Jack loses his beautiful wife, Harriet, he feels there is nothing worth living for. That is until his wife's friend and 'spiritual mentor', Marty, pays him a visit and they strike up an unusual friendship. Through the efforts of Marty and Todd, his twelve year old son, Jack slowly begins his journey of recovery. However, when he makes an incredible discovery about Harriet, Jack falls into a renewed despair, rejecting his son and threatening to destroy all the progress he has made. But a chain of events has been set in motion that will change his life forever. Jack must learn that life is far greater than his own sorrow and find it in himself to live, and love, again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645848</url></doc>
