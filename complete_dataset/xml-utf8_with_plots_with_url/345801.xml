<plot>It's another beautiful day at the monastery and Mother Maud, an older nun, is tending to her garden when Brother Bertrand, a young, pious monk, approaches. After reciting everyone else's sins he shares a message from Father Frank -- accusing Mother Maud of "salacious" behavior. Maud calls for Frank, dismisses Bertrand, and (lo and behold) perceives Frank's message as "flirting." The two take off together -- with Bertrand in hot pursuit. After giving chase, they lock themselves away in (heaven forbid) Frank's quarters. It's awkward. Bertrand bangs on the door. Stops. Did they lose him? No! He knows and he's off to tell the dreaded ABBOT ADOLFO! What will he say? What will they do? Passion and piety collide as monks and nuns come to terms with what it really means to "love thy neighbor..."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345801</url></doc>
