<plot>Young Nick Conover is forced to leave Chicago after being put on probation for stealing a car. From now on, he will have to live and work on the Kentucky farm of his uncle Jed Bruce and his aunt Henrietta. In other words, there he is, forlorn, in the middle of nowhere. All the more as his uncle, who does not seem to have overcome the death of his son Jed Jr., does not welcome him with open arms. It goes without saying that Nick, who is not such a bad boy after all, is very upset. But luckily, there is also kind-hearted aunt Henrietta, a wonderful trotter who has gone wild and who is just asking to be tamed as well as two charming young neighbors, Fran and Liz. All in all, happiness might well be a thing called Kentucky...!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043963</url></doc>
