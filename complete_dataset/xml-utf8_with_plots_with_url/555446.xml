<plot>The saga of the Perez family and how its political wheeling and dealing has affected Plaquemines Parish. Included are interviews with Judge Leander Perez, whose total control of the parish verged on the legendary. Clips of Leander Perez, Jr. and Chalin Perez are also presented, as are interviews with voters and prominent residents of the parish. The documentary, which reveals how poverty existed alongside wealth in a state stricken with political tyranny, describes what happened to a forgotten parish rocked by the discovery of oil in 1933.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555446</url></doc>
