<plot>The Lighthouse became the premiere jazz club in the Los Angeles area during the 1950s and 1960s. Through the use of numerous interviews, photographs, music and video clips this 78 minute film tells the story of the Lighthouse and two men of very different backgrounds and personalities who started and promoted the club and their band called 'The Lighthouse All-Stars' to the point of gaining world-wide fame. Famous jazz musicians began and fostered their careers at the Lighthouse and introduced many young people to their first taste of jazz. Along the way, musician Howard Rumsey and owner John Levine had to overcome many obstacles in order to create the success of their club. Among those difficulties were their own addictions as well as racial and religious prejudice and the fear of jazz musicians in the small town where the club was located. Also discussed are the roots of so-called west coast jazz or the 'cool school,' the beginnings of jazz in movie soundtracks, and how the impact of rock n' roll in the late 1950s affected jazz and the ways Rumsey and Levine adapted to this. Their partnership lasted 22 years until the death of Levine in the early 70s. In interviews, Rumsey, among others, provides a vivid account of the era. He is joined by musicians, jazz fans, jazz critics and a bartender and waitress from the original Lighthouse who bring this intriguing story alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274509</url></doc>
