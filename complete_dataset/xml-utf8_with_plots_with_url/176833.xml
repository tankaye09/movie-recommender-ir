Attaining the rank of Commander through through exemplary leadership and loyalty to Rome, Arminius attained the position of advisor to the new Roman Governor of Gaul, Quintillus Varus. But when Arminius returns home to Gaul, he discovers a dark reality; the people of his homeland are being oppressed and enslaved by the very nation he has sworn fealty to. As Arminius struggles to maintain the balance between his relationship with those of his home and his sworn duty as Roman officer, he bears witness to a great many brutalities thrust upon friend and family alike when finally he is pushed over the edge. Compelled to bring an end to the atrocities, Arminius makes the fateful decision to turn his back on Rome, striking a deathblow to his already decaying relationship with his brother Flavus who remains loyal to the Republic. Facing nearly insurmountable odds, Arminius must convince the devastated and sorely divided Germanic tribes of Gaul to unite in an effort to thwart Rome from incorporating more German territories into the Empire. Pleading with the tribal counsel, Arminius devises a plot that sets him and those of his homeland on a collision course with Rome and the most powerful army in the world. Nation against nation, brother against brother, it would be a clash that would forever change the course of European history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176833</url></doc>
