<plot>Originally built with leftover lumber and raw materials from their own homes in the mid-nineteenth century, residents came together to create the town's first public school house. It would later become a dentist's office, then a residential home, then moved two blocks down the street by horse. It survived a century and a half of wear, tear and weather to become a landmark. This is a documentary series that follows a group of master craftsmen as they work to restore the Beecher Quinlan House from the century-old school house it was to the luxurious home it will be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542661</url></doc>
