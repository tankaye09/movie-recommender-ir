<plot>A Roman Catholic priest, academic and author, Nouwen possessed a unique insight into the human condition. Through his many books, Father Nouwen wrote passionately and eloquently about the human communion of frailty and brokenness, while identifying and addressing the pressing spiritual needs of today. Journey of the Heart is thoughtful and thought-provoking look at the life of this unassuming, charismatic scholar considered by many of his contemporaries as having one of the best and brightest minds of his time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279913</url></doc>
