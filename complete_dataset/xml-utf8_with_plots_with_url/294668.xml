<plot>The greeat triennial conclave of the Knight Templars was held in the city of the "Colonels" August, 1901, and our artist attended specially for the purpose of obtaining these pictures. The weather was all that could be desired and the result was a series of striking and beautiful pictures which have never been excelled. The parade was through the main streets of Louisville and shows the leading commanderies which took the prize for perfection in drill and accoutrement. The scene was unequalled in brilliancy and is especially interesting to masonic bodies throughout the world. Any one who has seen a drill of this famous order will readily appreciate its successful interest. The complete line of march was secured on a film 300 feet long, but we can furnish it in any of the following lengths: 300 ft., 200 ft., 100 ft., 50 ft.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294668</url></doc>
