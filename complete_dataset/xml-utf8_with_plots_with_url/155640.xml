<plot>First came the news reports: A virus, a plague, terrorism - they pointed fingers at everything except the truth. Next came the emergency broadcasts: Lock yourself in, conserve water and food - prepare a weapon, and above all, don't lose heart - help is on its way. Then the TVs stopped, and the electricity and gas ran out. Finally the only thing still broadcasting is a BBC '10 Point Emergency Plan': Outdated and crackly, but at least it's a voice in the darkness. Two months later and Lucy, bordering on malnutrition, is running out of water. Raised during the second world war, she's seen her fair share of tough, but as she's forced to escape her barricaded home - nothing could prepare her for the fight she has coming. Lucy wants out - but all the zombies want to do is get in!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?155640</url></doc>
