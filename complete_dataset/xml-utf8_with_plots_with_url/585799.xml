<plot>The Receipt tells the story of two college seniors, Evie and Norah, who as they enter their final year of college begin to feel the weight of uncertainty about their respective futures. By a happy chance, and some instigating on the part of Norah, Evie suddenly falls for Thomas, a recent college graduate working at a resort restaurant for the summer as a waiter. The new relationship begins to make the shy Evie more open and outgoing, but as she spends more and more time with Thomas, Norah, nervous about her and Evie's futures and about the prospect of her friendship with Evie collapsing, becomes jealous and insecure, leading to conflict and betrayal. The Receipt is a story of friendship, romance, loyalty, forgiveness, and coming to realize who we are and becoming comfortable with ourselves and with those who care about us.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585799</url></doc>
