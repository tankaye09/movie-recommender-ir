<plot>"One of the finest marching scenes ever taken by a camera; the soldier boys pass keeping accurate time and step with the mounted officers in the van on their way from camp to board the train for the front, to take an active part in the war, from which some of them will never return. The street is lined with interested spectators and if this film can be given with orchestra marching accompaniment it will prove the hit of the evening."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407658</url></doc>
