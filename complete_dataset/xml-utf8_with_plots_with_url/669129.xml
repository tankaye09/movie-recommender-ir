<plot>In the shores of Sulu lives the sea-faring tribe that is ruled by Datu Tanbuong. His granddaughter, Minda (Rosa del Rosario) is betrothed to be married to Danao (Fernando Poe), who is a handsome young pearl fisher who presents a handful of impressive pearls to the datu. However, a visitor to Danao and Minda's wedding celebration is Hadji Razul, a chief of another tribe who has feelings for Minda. He then solicited the help of a renegade American captain to abduct Minda. Minda was abducted, and a tribal war ensued. In the end, Danao kills Hadji Razul, and the film ends with Minda and Danao sailing into the sunset.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?669129</url></doc>
