<plot>The story of a 12-year-old Singaporean-Malay girl who has just witnessed the death of her older brother, Shahim. The tragedy occurs when the boy goes for a swim and quickly gets into trouble. Wati, who cannot swim, begs a man to help her, but he ignores her pleas and Shahim drowns. Wati's parents are devastated. Her mother tries to hold the family together, while her father struggles to control his misdirected anger. The role of Islam in the lives of Wati and her family is revealed, for it is impossible to separate their beliefs from their lifestyle and the manner in which they deal with Shahim's death. Wati's story is intertwined with two others: an Indian courier with a penchant for drinking and fighting; and a Chinese man who is consumed by career goals. It becomes increasingly apparent that each of these men played some role in the death of her brother, and as Wati begins to follow them, the mystery deepens.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474590</url></doc>
