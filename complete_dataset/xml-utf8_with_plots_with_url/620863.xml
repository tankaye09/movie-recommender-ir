<plot>He's had it with her manipulative games and mistrust. She's had it with his mood swings and refusal to even try to communicate. Love doesn't always conquer all. So you break up...but then what? Told as a "vignette trilogy", Tumbling After touches down on three points along the post-break up time line, permitting fly-on-the-wall insight into the chance encounters, planned rendezvous and opportunistic entrapments, of Jack Wilder and Jill Gates, two ex-lovers whose attraction to one another is rivaled only by their animosity for one another.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?620863</url></doc>
