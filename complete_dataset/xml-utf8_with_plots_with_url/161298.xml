<plot>An authentic story of of anguish and love. This beautiful documentary follows an extraordinary individual whose life is thoroughly intertwined with the land. Dubak is an exceptional personality in the Gush Etzion region of the West Bank. This territory, occupied by Israel since the 1967 war, is where Dubak lives and where he has created a unique way in which to to justify his presence there. He is a bereaved father, an informal educator and a soul mate to the local Arab population. Together with the native Bedouin Dubak set up a retrieval and rescue mission to track missing persons in the desert. As somewhat of a lost soul himself, this kind of intense and solitary work allows him eventually to create a balance with the people and the land. The Film follows his emotional journey through the many facets that make up this complex man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161298</url></doc>
