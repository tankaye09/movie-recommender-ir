<plot>Zona Rossa is a coming of age drama/comedy about Alfredo, a lonely introverted Italian teenager, who's an excellent student and a good son to his only family, his mother Anabella. On the night of his 16th birthday, he becomes involved with David's circle of cool and popular friends. As they enter a decadent and surreal brothel in the outskirts of Rome, Alfredo finds himself caught in between two worlds, having to chose between proving his masculinity to his new group of friends or continuing to be a good boy. In trying to remain uncorrupted in a world that is more corrupt than he thought, Alfredo learns to be a man at the expense of his own innocence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?671942</url></doc>
