<plot>Paul Parin, nowadays a well-known Swiss psychoanalyst and writer spent his childhood and youth at his father's estate in Novi Kloster in Slovenia. In 1941 he and his family, Jewish by origin, due to the imminent Nazi threat retreated to Switzerland. In 1944 he and his wife Goldy Parin Matthey decided to go to Montenegro and as doctors help the Yugoslav resistance. While visiting Slovenia after the World War II he started to write his literary works that thematically move back to his childhood, evoke the memories of the revolution and its consequences. The picturesque anecdotes from his youth are interwoven with the observations of a psychoanalyst which he became later on. Through Parin's testimony, conversations with him and his contemporaries and following the traces of his books this documentary film brings alive a unique destiny of an individual in the turbulent 20th century.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?440694</url></doc>
