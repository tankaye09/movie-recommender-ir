<plot>The rules of correct behavior found in books of etiquette present themselves as aiding communication and helping people understand each other. They also claim to help us engage socially with greater ease and self confidence. These rules are learned from birth which is the only way for us to completely internalize them. Their model is found in western civilizations, and compliance with them makes it easy to discern who is civilized and who is not. The film deals with customs of eating and drinking - specifically with the lunch situation, as communal eating is the central site of showing others our breeding and finesse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469932</url></doc>
