<plot>In this black and white homage to the Twilight Zone, the shot opens in a typical office environment. Cris sits at his desk with his head in his arms. Slowly, he stirs and begins typing, his voice-over revealing his frustration with his job and his co-workers, who seem to ignore him. Suddenly, Cris realizes that his co-workers are all zombies, mindlessly repeating the same tasks over and over, as if time has stopped! He tries to escape, but the building is surrounded by wasteland. Cris returns back to his desk and puts his head in his arms. He slowly stirs and begins typing, the same voice-over repeating itself. We realize that Cris, like all his co-workers, is doomed to repeat these same moments forever!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?120676</url></doc>
