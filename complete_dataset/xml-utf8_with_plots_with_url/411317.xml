<plot>On the road that leads from from Mount Popa to Bagan - the main tourist site in a country, Myanmar, which only recently has opened its borders to visitors - a farmer speaks of his everyday toils. Listening to his words, gradually the account throws light on the wider social and political situation in former Burma. The country has been subject to a ferocious military dictatorship since 1962.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411317</url></doc>
