<plot>A tragic tale about a husband and wife's trip from rural Senegal to Dakar to take their sick two-year-old daughter to a hospital. The distraught parents are unable to buy the medication necessary to save the child's life, and she dies shortly after she is admitted. The father, in order to comply with burial custom (which requires the body to be buried immediately), is forced to travel on a bus with the body of his daughter to get her to the city cemetery. While riding on the bus the man reflects on the isolated, petty lives of city dwellers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396696</url></doc>
