The trio get in the bad books of an underworld don named Swami, who soon they launches a vendetta against them. As a result, Pitamber gets killed, and both Yeshwant and Pratap swear to avenge his death.

Then Swami makes his move - Pratap's sister and brother-in-law are abducted and held at gunpoint. When Yeshwant goes to rescue them, he is gunned down. Now Pratap, the only remaining Kohli brother, is the only target of Swami.
