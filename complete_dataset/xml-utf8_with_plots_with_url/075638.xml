<plot>Mysterious blood has been discovered on the remains of an ancient religious artifact. Some believe it is the blood of Christ and experiments with specific genes from the blood have brought surprising findings. Now it's time to introduce those genes into a human. Enter Michael Coleman, multiple killer, death-row resident and, if he is willing, human guinea pig. There are no promises. The effects may kill Coleman or completely destroy his sanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075638</url></doc>
