<plot>This is altogether a remarkable subject, handled in such a high-class way as to make it an extremely appropriate subject for exhibitors who make a specialty of church and lyceum work. A river bank is shown thickly lined with rushes. Through a wandering path come Pharoah's daughter and her attendants. At the edge of the stream the infant Moses is found peacefully sleeping in a bed of rushes. After all of the party have surveyed the infant in silent admiration the princess takes it up lovingly and after fondling it gives it to one of her women and the procession than starts back through the rushes. The scene is made particularly effective by the fact that a live and kicking baby is employed, and by the naturalness of the scene throughout.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377941</url></doc>
