<plot>A young man is waiting in a laundromat until his laundry is ready, when an attractive young lady enters. The young man is immediately interested, but it's hard to get noticed by her. The woman doesn't offer him more than some eye glances and a few smiles. When she is ready with her laundry, she leaves. The man is disappointed and continues with his laundry, when he notices a pair of underpants of the woman has been mixed-up with his own garments. One look to the laundromat patron is enough and he rushes out. In the distance the woman is walking and a car is approaching, driving through the puddles. Water is spattering up. Will he be in time to save the lady another walk to the laundromat?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082975</url></doc>
