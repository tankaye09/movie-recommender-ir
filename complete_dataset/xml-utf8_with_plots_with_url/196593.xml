<plot>Banny and Mark are best friends, finishing college. Mark asks Banny for help moving his sister's things out of the apartment of her boyfriend, whom she says assaulted her. They help her move. Then Mark decides he wants more - retribution, payback. Banny resists: do they know what actually happened? Plus, the guy is rumored to have a gun. Mark is persistent and gathers other friends. They have options: their own assault of the boyfriend, perhaps a verbal confrontation, or maybe just a simple warning. What Banny and Mark do tests the definition of manhood, of self-respect, and of good sense. Meanwhile, do men own women?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196593</url></doc>
