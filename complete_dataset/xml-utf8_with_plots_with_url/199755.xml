<plot>Catherine; a beautiful black woman from Canada lands in LA with dreams of 'making her mark', but first she wants to get an apartment in a good neighbourhood. Her independence and naivet√© propel her, when doors shut and apartments become 'suddenly unavailable' when she shows up. On this sunny, average day, Catherine unwittingly steps into the realm of Viola Ceckny; a tragic figure, having spent years of face time with the television. Her only communication with the outside world; her local nightly news. Viola, hair trigger amped and imprisoned by a desperate siege mentality finally takes control when, on this day, her greatest fear becomes reality. Viola's reality, snatches Catherine into a harrowing world that exposes her to the depths of racial ignorance and taps her primal instinct to survive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199755</url></doc>
