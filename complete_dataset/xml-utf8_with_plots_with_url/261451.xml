<plot>This documentary celebrates the life of a devoted musician: Pandit Pran Nath. The last in a long line of north Indian vocal masters in the Kirana style of Indian classical music, we trace his journey from India, accompanied by his disciple, the avant-garde composer Terry Riley, in their search for purity of expression.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261451</url></doc>
