<plot>Racing against time, a naively ambitious Lorelle leaves family and home behind in Texas in order to embark upon a new life in San Francisco -- as an aspiring actress. But even in a city so far removed from all that she has known before, Lorelle finds herself stalked by her former life in the person of an apparently crazed denizen of the streets, a ranting sibyl who seems to know entirely too much about Lorelle's past... and future. Something relentless keeps reaching out of the past, signaling that it's not about to let her go, and each intriguing encounter pushes Lorelle closer to the realization that what she thought was a new start may well be the end of the road.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096078</url></doc>
