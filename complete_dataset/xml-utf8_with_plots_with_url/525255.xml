<plot>Alex Young is a smart, good-looking college student destined for a successful future. He has a loving girlfriend and an All-American appeal that makes people gravitate towards him. But when two filmmakers choose to shoot a documentary about his life, they quickly learn that Alex is no Prince Charming. Underneath his warm smile lies a terrifying rage, one that leads the filmmakers into a world of horror. They can only watch as Alex hunts down, seduces, and then brutally murders innocent female victims. Not only are the filmmakers forced to watch Alex's intense carnage first hand, but find themselves aiding him in what they believe to be a guaranteed box-office hit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525255</url></doc>
