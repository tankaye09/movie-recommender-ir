<plot>Widowed Abdul Rehman Khan is an Afghani Pathan who lives a simple and poor lifestyle with his widowed mom, and daughter, Amina, in Kabul. He owes money to a money-lender that he had borrowed for Amina's medical treatment, and is unable to re-pay it. He decides to secretly re-locate to Hindustan, without the knowledge of Amina, and he does so in the dark of the night. Upon arrival in Hindustan, he finds that the locals actually fear him and his kind, and blame them for kidnapping young children. A depressed Abdul is unable to get Amina out of his mind, and spends a week without doing any business. After that he sets out to sell dry fruits on the streets. It is here that he meets a young girl, Mini, who lives with her mom, Rama, and her dad, a Writer. Rama is overly cautious and will not permit Mini to see Abdul, while her dad permits her to do so. Abdul sees Amina in Mini and visits her everyday, pampering her with dry fruits. On her birthday Mini misses him and goes to look for him and gets lost. Rama thinks that Abdul has abducted her, so does an angry crowd, who find her with him and beat him. Mini's dad apologizes to Abdul when he finds out the truth. But this outing has a serious repercussion on Mini and she becomes very ill, but with prayers from Rama and Abdul, she does recover. Then their lives are again turned upside down when Abdul is arrested by the Police for knifing to death a man named Ram Bharose. Watch what happens when Abdul is found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in jail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283673</url></doc>
