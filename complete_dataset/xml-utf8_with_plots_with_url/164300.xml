<plot>George Wickman was a rookie phenom, a Sandy Koufax-good pitcher who burst onto the scene and took his team to the World Series, But under pressure, he caved, and never recovered. Wickman is now the scary old man in the neighborhood, offering menacing glances at kids playing ball. He wanders in and out of his old stadium, unable to stop imagining himself back in that big moment. But just as he's ready to give up on what he sees as his failure of a life, he finds redemption in those same neighborhood kids, and rediscovers his youth by playing catch like a boy again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164300</url></doc>
