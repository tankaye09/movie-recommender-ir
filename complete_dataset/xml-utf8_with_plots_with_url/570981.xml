<plot>In placing this wonderful picture or series of pictures before the public it was our aim to illustrate the entire workings of a model fire department. This picture, in its complete form, shows the firemen sitting in front of the fire house, when suddenly an alarm is sounded. You see the rush and break for the inside of the fire house, to get to their respective places on the apparatus before going to the fire. The next picture shows them leaving the engine house; the mad dash out of doors, and the most realistic fire run shown on canvas. Twenty-eight pieces of fire fighting machines madly rushing and plunging down a thoroughfare on the way to the fire; exciting races between rival companies; the men putting on their coats and fire hats; the drivers lashing their horses. It is indeed a great and inspiring scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570981</url></doc>
