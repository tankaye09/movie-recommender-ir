<plot>She wants to be the perfect wife. If hubby wants ketchup, she'll drive to Missouri to stomp the tomatoes herself. If he likes Blondes, she is going to rush right down to dye her hair, and then dye the hair of all the women on the block too. But where does the line blur between healthy nurturing and obsessive, horrific over-pleasing? This is a tale of young husband who comes home on his birthday to find that his sexy, loving, doting wife has fulfilled all his fantasies... even the ones he didn't know about, or really want.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270338</url></doc>
