<plot>A rare and lively examination of disability and homosexuality as it affects both women and men, Double the Trouble, Twice the Fun advocates for acceptance rather than pity for participants in this video. Interviews with a wide range of disabled lesbian and gay people are inter-cut with dramatic recreations and performances. Made for Channel Four Television by Pratibha Parmar (A Place of Rage, Warrior Marks), this enlightening video dispels the myth that all disabled people are unhappy or have no sexual identity. It also looks at the difficulties of enduring prejudice as both a disabled and gay person.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?157734</url></doc>
