<plot>It's Christmas time. Roger returns home to reconcile with his younger sister, Brooke, who he hasn't seen in almost three years. He arrives with his new fianc√©e, Gwen, only to find out that Brooke is nowhere to be seen. To make matters worse, he's greeted by his estranged friend, Charles, and his ex-girlfriend, Kate, who have come to meddle in the evening's festivities. Suspicious of their intentions, Roger tries to keep his volatile temper at bay while everyone waits for Brooke to get home. Brooke's alleged boyfriend, Marcus, enters the house unexpectedly and assures the group that Brooke will be there shortly. As time passes, and her whereabouts still remain unknown, the night takes a disturbing turn. Roger's unsavory past comes to light as Marcus's true intentions explode into a shocking display of violence and deception.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357536</url></doc>
