<plot>A production crew of four people decides to look for the identity of the 17th victim who was killed in a suicide terrorist attack and buried in an unmarked grave. This film documents in real time over a period of six months the search for the identity of a man whose body was badly mutilated and whom no one claimed missing. Parallel to the story of the search for one victim's identity the film pursues numerous people's stories. Together these create a portrait of a society living under the shadow of death. When it seems that the investigation has reached a dead end a vague lead suddenly appears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?399120</url></doc>
