<plot>These three films [with LAFAYETTE POST OF NEW YORK and LAMBS POST OF PHILA.] were taken at the encampent of the G.A.R. in Chicago, 1901. They can be used as one complete series or run separately. They form the three leading features of the G.A.R. parade the first owing to the fact it held the post of honor, the second because it was the largest and best dressed, and the latter because it created a great deal of comment owing to the fact that it was headed by a little lamb led by a beautiful child in white. This was the finest G.A.R. parade ever held and pictures from it are of more than ordinary interest, for the veterans will never again congregate in such numbers or engage in such an extended parade as upon this occasion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111215</url></doc>
