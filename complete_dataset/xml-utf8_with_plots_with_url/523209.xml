<plot>What are a couple of beach bums like Matt and Zack to do? They dream of big time surfing careers, but Matt has all the skills but no drive, while Zack has all of the drive but no skills. What are a couple of beach bums to do? Why, go to Sicily, of course. Sicily!?? Yes, Sicily, where an eccentric Italian business man has built the worlds largest outdoor artificial wave park. To promote his park, he is sponsoring a surfing competition. Matt qualifies; Zack does not, but goes along for the ride. They are going to win the twenty-five thousand dollar prize: Simple right? But throw in a power hungry wannabe Mafia Don, his gorgeous bride to be, her model girl friend, INTERPOL, a possessed VW, ten million dollars in smuggled diamonds and a lovesick pig and maybe not so simple after all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523209</url></doc>
