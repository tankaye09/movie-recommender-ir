<plot>A Taste of Us is an urban television drama that envelops the viewer from start to finish. Set in the 60's segregated south, a small town minister comes together with his dysfunctional family on Thanksgiving Day, where the main dish is not that of supper, but of rising conflict among each other. The Reverend Henry Lee Thomas, a prominent community leader is driven in ministry and counseling of his beloved church flock. Ironically the Reverend fails to provide the same love and attention to his own family. Determined to keep the peace at the supper table, he comes to realize perhaps too late, how important his family really means to him. In "A Taste of Us" viewers get a taste of this family's life, conflict and resolution.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016996</url></doc>
