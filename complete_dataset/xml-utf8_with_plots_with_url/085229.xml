<plot>A young family, driving along a road in Britain fall prey to a minor collision due to Dad's daydreaming about a golf game. The boy in the back of the car is in dismay as his newly won goldfish splits its bag. A rescue effort begins, culminating in Mum pouring the fish into a bottle of drinking water donated by a passing gorgeous blonde flagged down by Dad. The enigmatic driver of the stationary vehicle that was driven into spontaneously reveals the load of his van to be a hand made rocking horse. Not having a business card, he writes his number on Mum's arm. Hours later a recovery vehicle arrives, and the family are taken home with Dad fantasising about the blonde, Mum fantasising about the other driver, and the boy dreaming about a beach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085229</url></doc>
