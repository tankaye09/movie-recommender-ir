<plot>Based on true events, 44 is the story of Migs, an 18 year old high school student trapped between the two opposing forces of his father, a drug dealer and convicted felon, and his mother, an NYPD cop. For the last two years, Migs has been leading a double life. His ambitious yet arrogant father has placed Migs in charge of his drug operation while he is incarcerated. At the same time, Migs is living with his well-meaning but hot-tempered mother. Now, with his father out of prison and attempting to regain control of his business, and his mother trying to regain control of her son's life, Migs is forced to make difficult choices and find his own destiny. He struggles to manipulate all of his resources and win over Jessica, the girl he's falling for, while at the same time detaching himself from his father's influence and greed. Out of this struggle emerges a story that lives in the blurred line between right and wrong. And finds that all choices, whether made voluntarily or forced upon us...will define the person we become.</plot><plot>Based on true events, 44 is the story of Migs, an 18 year old high school student trapped between the two opposing forces of his father, a drug dealer and convicted felon, and his mother, an NYPD cop.
