<plot>In an epiphany that changes his life forever, maverick telemarketer John Stiles begins addressing his cold calls using the distinct voice and phrases of the colorful characters he grew up with in rural Nova Scotia. "How yah doon a'night?" John quips as he launches into the next pitch. At first it's a diversion that gets him through the day, but after its unexpected success at the call center, Stiles takes the voices he develops and turns them into astoundingly original and engaging live performances that turns the literary world on its ear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481777</url></doc>
