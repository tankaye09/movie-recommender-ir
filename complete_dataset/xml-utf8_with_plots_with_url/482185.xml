<plot>Ralph Staub hosts Ken Murray and Laurie Anders, and they watch stock footage taken from stock footage taken from more stock footage from about five different Screen Snapshots from over the years, some of which were compiled entirely from previous Screen Snapshots stock footage. The busiest man on the Columbia payroll had to be the editor who clipped, re-clipped and re-clipped footage from other Screen Snapshots in order to have "new" Screen Snapshots to send to the exhibitors...after Ralph Staub stepped before the camera and asked whoever it was hanging around the lot that week..."you wanna see some old westerns footage?" There was never a Screen Snapshots that had a "premiere," even if somebody thinks a film-paper trade review counts as such.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482185</url></doc>
