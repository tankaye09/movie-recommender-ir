<plot>An unapologetic re-examination of one bad night which unfolds as our Narrator walks alone down a deserted city street, is threatened by drunks and called upon to question his own sexuality. As the night wears on and becomes day, he is forced to consider the consequences of his seemingly poor choices, as well as alternate courses of action, which may or may not lead him to a fleeting, but impeccably honest and devastatingly perfect moment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582194</url></doc>
