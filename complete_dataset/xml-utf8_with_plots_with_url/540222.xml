<plot>The legend of John Henry, historically celebrated in song and story, is the account of an ex-slave and steel driver who victoriously raced a drilling machine through a mountain, died of exhaustion shortly after and hence became an African-American folk hero. Anthony Milo is the strongest and fastest sprinter at New York City's Gonzaga College, whose 4 x 400 meter relay team is on their way to winning a national championship title. What do these two men have in common? In both of their stories they are destined to race towards death to let their true spirits live. THE ANCHOR MAN is the story of strength reborn into the heart of a young man, whose convictions lead him on a journey from the explosion of the starting gun to an explosion of artistic expression.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540222</url></doc>
