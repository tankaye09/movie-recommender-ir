<plot>When All Else Fails is a dramatic thriller about a billionaire's son who comes to realize the power of life and love when his girlfriend is put into a life-threatening situation. Mike, the film's protagonist, is 18, rich, and getting ready to leave for college. At his father, billionaire Thomas Williams', urging, Mike struggles with whether or not to break up with his long-time girlfriend, Andreana-- a free-spirited girl who is from a lower economic class-- in favor of college-bound freedom. But when Andreana is kidnapped and held for ransom, Mike is forced to go along with her captor's demands in order to keep Andreana, and himself, alive. Though most ransom stories focus on problems with the money drop or kidnapping, the conflict in this story is much more vital-- Andreana is diabetic, and as Mike struggles to get to her, her blood sugar drops lower and lower, to a point where every minute that passes really is a matter of life or death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652603</url></doc>
