<plot>Nothing can exceed the stubborn resistance shown by the Gordon Highlanders, as we see them steadily advancing in the face of a murderous fire of the Boers, who are making their guns speak with rapid volleys. One by one the gunners fall beside their guns, and as the smoke clears for an instant the Highlanders are seen gaining nearer and nearer the disputed ground. Finally a grand charge is made, the siege is carried, and amid cheers they plant the colors on the spot they have so dearly earned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093889</url></doc>
