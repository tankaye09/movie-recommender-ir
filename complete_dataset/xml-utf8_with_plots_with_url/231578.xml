<plot>Ravi Lal lives a wealthy lifestyle with his businessman dad, Ratan, housewife mom, and a sister named Seema. When Ratan gets an offer from Murugan to buy the plot and land, he refuses, and is subsequently killed along with Seema. Ravi who witnesses this killing comes to their aid, is grievously injured and hospitalized. After recuperating, his mom insists that he marry his sweetheart, Kavita Jaiswal, and the marriage does take place. After the marriage, Kavita notices that Ravi is not the same anymore, he is more quiet, brooding, and keeps away from her. She suspects that he may be attracted to another woman. What Kavita does not is that Ravi had indeed been killed by Murugan and his men, but his body has been taken over by a venomous shape-changing snake that is out for vengeance - and will kill everyone who dares to stand in it's way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231578</url></doc>
