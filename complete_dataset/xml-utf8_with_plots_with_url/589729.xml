<plot>Evelyn is catching up with her best friend Sue in a café. She admires Sue's new leather jacket that she won through an Internet auction site. At the café bar Evelyn spots a familiar young woman wearing the exact same jacket, yet Sue fails to see her. Later that night Evelyn has a series of nightmarish visions relating to the young woman, the jacket and a strange farmhouse. In the morning she remembers that the young woman is the missing person she read about in a newspaper article. Evelyn is convinced that the Seller of Sue's jacket is related to the young woman's disappearance, so she embarks on a journey to the same farmhouse from her dreams to find the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589729</url></doc>
