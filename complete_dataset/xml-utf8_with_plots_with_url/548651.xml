<plot>Fr. René is an inspiring, accomplished priest bereft of dignity. Since the scandals, the posturing and zero tolerance policies by the Archdiocese have stripped him of his vocation and orders. Fraught with this grave imposition he struggles with depression, desperation and guilt. The people he once guided are confused and frustrated by the hypocrisy of the situation. In secret they struggle to make a decision that will affect them and Fr. René forever. As Fr. René quietly labors to regain his autonomy and purpose, he gradually finds salvation through a deceptively simple exterior. At this point, his life and the lives closest to him become one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548651</url></doc>
