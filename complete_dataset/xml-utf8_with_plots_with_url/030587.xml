<plot>Martin is living a loveless and sex-starved existence. If he doesn't pull himself together, his ex-wife will sell his beloved wine bar. Martin is cast back into the horrifying world of London dating. His best friend Liam thinks he knows what a woman wants, but only one night at a time. Even his help can't prepare Martin for the heart-achingly sexy Eva; and her dating Rottweiler, Douglas Todd. Todd is the modern woman's antidote to time wasters and losers. To date Eva, Martin needs Todd's blessing. To keep the bar, Martin needs a date. What Martin really needs is a bloody miracle. All Bar Love is, ironically, the perfect date movie.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030587</url></doc>
