<plot>Janet Ellis invites three experts to 'heal' a house that is making its inhabitants unhappy. In the opening episode of the series, horrifying nightmares and a depressing atmosphere have led one family to believe they are unwelcome in their own house. Healthy house expert Jane Alexander, clairvoyant Michele Knight and feng shui expert Richard Ashworth try to discover whether paranormal forces are to blame for the family's problems. One expert will have the chance to makeover the troubled spooky house from top to bottom clearing out not only the cobwebs, but all the bad energy that previously plagued the owners.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247758</url></doc>
