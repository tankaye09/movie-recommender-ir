<plot>This edition of the March of Time series takes a brief look backwards at where the world has come in the first 50 years of the century, and then presents a number of prominent people who state their views of the next fifty years of the 20th century. Among those shown are labor leader Walter Reuther, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Omar Bradley, and A-Bomb scientist Robert Oppenheimer. Harry Pollitt, leader of the Communist Party in Britain, predicts that all roads will lead to world-wide Communism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?368759</url></doc>
