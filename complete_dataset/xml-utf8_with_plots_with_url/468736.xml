<plot>Recently separated from his wife Stacy after she catches him with another woman, Michael moves into the 1920's Belle View Apartments on Rosewood Avenue. By day his new home seems ideal: persistent blue skies, beds of roses, clean streets and friendly people. But there are also anomalies: the cobwebs suddenly appearing around his apartment, the changing furniture, the partying neighbors in Roaring Twenties costume. Nightfall reveals the street's true sinister nature, when humanoid figures attack residents out in the open, spiriting them off to an unknown fate. Michael witnesses these abductions and thinks he might be going insane, but neighbor Peter has figured out what really is going on. It is up to him to warn Michael to get off the street, before the cheating husband learns that the grass is not always greener on the other side.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?468736</url></doc>
