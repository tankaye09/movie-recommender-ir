<plot>A spoiled young man from a rich family likes to race his car through town and then try to outrun the police who chase him, although he's usually caught. After his latest incident his father warns him to cease and desist, and the man promises to reform. However, he soon goes back to his old ways, but this time while fleeing two motorcycle cops he crashes his car. Thinking he has killed one of the officers, he flees town and winds up penniless in a small town many miles away, but falls in love with the daughter of the local police chief.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648244</url></doc>
