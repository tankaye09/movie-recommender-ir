<plot>Four hilarious news stories come to you from that crack news team of KJWI news. First a special investigative report on a recent string of carjackings and what you can do to prevent it. Next, an exclusive interview with the new world record holder of the 500 meter dash and her credit to a higher power. Because sports is so important, another story comes in from the regional qualifier, world soccer event; and the game winning goal that the player gets a little too excited about in his celebration. And lastly the weather report from our own, "Mr. Sunshine," and his live report outside the studio braving the cold and snow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283371</url></doc>
