<plot>Some Chinese immigrants attempt to enter the U.S. illegally, with the principal story being the misadventures of one man who tries to have himself smuggled across the Mexican border in a barrel after customs inspectors search the steamship on which several of them arrived. His accomplice attempts to transport the barrel safely, but the runaway barrel meets with a train and a case of dynamite, among other obstacles. Another man tries to disguise himself as an Irishman to get around the anti-Chinese laws.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502886</url></doc>
