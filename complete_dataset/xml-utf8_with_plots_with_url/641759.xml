<plot>VISIONING TIBET chronicles the passion of two San Francisco based ophthalmologists: Marc Lieberman MD, founder of the Tibet Vision Project and Melvyn D. Bert MD, director Lhasa Eye Program. Their mission: to end preventable blindness in Tibet - which has the highest rate of untreated cataract blindness in the world - by 2020. Bringing light where there was once darkness, Lieberman's work has been recognized by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, which named him 2003 Humanitarian of the Year. The film is built around the stories of two of Tibetans - Karma (a farmer from a small village in Northern Tibet) and Lhasang (patriarch of a nomadic family from the Tibetan plains) - who make the arduous journey to a remote clinic in the hopes of having their sight restored by Tibetan doctors trained by Dr. Lieberman and Dr. Bert.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641759</url></doc>
