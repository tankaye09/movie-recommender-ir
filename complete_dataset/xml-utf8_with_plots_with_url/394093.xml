<plot>This all happened very rapidly and people look at me and say how come you're not living in Rancho Santa Fe and where's your horses and where's your multiple cars or whatever. I don't look at life that way, I look at it like it's something to have to look at responsibly and try to use it so it will work out for your family the most. So I'm just taking it little by little and starting to change my life as I go along. It's given me a lot of free time and I can take a lot more vacation time and a lot more trips around the world and things of that nature. Most of all it's made me look back and say where have I come from and where am I going and how did I get here. You always have to keep that in mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394093</url></doc>
