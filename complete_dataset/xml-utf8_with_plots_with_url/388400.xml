Chitra, on the other hand is the opposite, extrovert, outgoing, and having an affair with a Judge's son, Ramesh. Chitra soon finds out that Ramesh is an alcoholic, and a womanizer, but she would still like him to marry her, as she is expecting his child. Then a young man, Prakash, finds out that Prof. Kumar had an affair with his mother, Parvati, and abandoned her in a pregnant state, when he found out that she was going to lose her vision.
