<plot>Frank Towler is found dead in bed, still dressed for his birthday party held earlier that afternoon. A plastic suicide bag and a farewell video are found at the scene. The doctor says Frank, paralysed from Motor Neurone Disease, could not have taken his own life. Frank's daughter, Sister Ann-Marie, a nun, accuses Jacob Bashir, her father's lover of seven years of killing him before the Will was changed in her favour. Murder? Assisted suicide? Two separate juries simultaneously assess the evidence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483954</url></doc>
