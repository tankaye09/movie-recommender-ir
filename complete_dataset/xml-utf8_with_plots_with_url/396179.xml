<plot>There's been an accident at Sanmento Genetics research lab. A large, genetically altered spider has escaped and has taken up residence in a sleepy seaside town. Soon after, a city bus is found abandoned and empty, it's passengers mysteriously vanished including one politically dissident Professor, Emil Admoster. Second rate detective Lee Bowers is sent to the town to investigate Admoster's dissappearance, but soon finds the scope of this case is far beyond his suspect abilities as well as his patience. As he is sucked deeper into the unfolding horror, Bowers finds himself surrounded by mutant terrorists who live only in fog, and strange android like beings with oversized yellow "happy heads" who seem to have a connection with the escaped spider. Bowers realizes he is being watched and manipulated by an emerging shadow government whose sinister intentions could bring about a world wide castastrophe. As the sun sets on this unsuspecting little town, soon it will be Night For Nixie.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396179</url></doc>
