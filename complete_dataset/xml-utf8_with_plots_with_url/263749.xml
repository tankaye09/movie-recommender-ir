<plot>Mosu, who gave up drugs trying to find his place in the society, found out one day that his worst enemy, Brazilianu, has survived the explosion that killed all his friends five years earlier. His life suddenly comes to a strange turn when the policeman who used to question him before asks for Mosu's help in locating his kidnapped daughter. The only viable plan, though, cannot be fulfilled without the help of an antiquities dealer who also grew up in the neighborhood but moved to England. Will Mosu be able to save the girl and get revenge?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263749</url></doc>
