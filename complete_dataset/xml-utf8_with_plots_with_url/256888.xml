<plot>This film is a portrait of post communist Bulgaria, focused on the daily ground of two friends. One of them is a psychiatrist, trying to extricate himself from the depressive world of the mental home and from the troubles by means of spirits and psychedelic music he composes; the other is a former political prisoner, one of the most outstanding figures of anticommunist opposition in the recent decade, now a businessman, going all out to secure his place in the sun in an uncompromising world. Setting the worlds of these two human beings in contrast, the film reveals not just the decay of a doomed society, but also the extinction of a non-recoverable friendship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256888</url></doc>
