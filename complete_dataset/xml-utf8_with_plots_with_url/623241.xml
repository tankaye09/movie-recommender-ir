<plot>Tyrannical Love is a film about the quirkiness of life and love when you are no longer a kid but not quite an adult. There is something for everyone in this ensemble piece about a close knit group of friends and the events that take place on New Years 1999. There's NICK the young filmmaker who has to make the choice between two women, one is his best friend who he has known for years, and the other is his first love who just walked back into his life. He unfortunately takes some ill-conceived advice and administers a series of love tests to help him decide. There's MADDI the best friend, she's just broken it off with her long-term boyfriend. Now she's all confused, not sure of her feelings for Nick. DAMMON; he's firstly in love with Maddi but hasn't got the confidence to tell her, because he feels he is a failure at everything he does, especially in the eyes of his father. VICKY; she's the mother figure of the group, always has the answers for everyone's problems but her own. Her dream is to be an actress and her up-coming audition may be her shot. DARYL; everyone knows one of these guys he's slack, tactless, sex obsessed and of course has a heart of gold. His big goal is to be having sex at the turn of the millennium. As new years eve rapidly counts down events unfold that will put their friendships to the test, and eventually bring everything into perspective. But by then it may already be too late!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623241</url></doc>
