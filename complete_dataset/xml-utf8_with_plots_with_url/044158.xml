<plot>The King of Atlantis. The undisputed ruler of two-thirds of the Earth. His friends call him Orin. You know him as Aquaman. Our story takes place after the events of Zero Hour. Aquaman has lost his hand. His only son died when Aquaman made the choice to pursue his attacker rather than rush his son to aid. And his wife Mera has been driven mad by their loss. In our world, the surface dwellers see him as nothing more than a sidekick. He is a cartoon character with the power to control fish. Among his people, he is a King who has abandoned them as he, in their eyes, sought out glory on land. He is truly a man without a country, Hamlet beneath the waves. Ashamed with his failures and confused by his place in things, he has fled Atlantis and the comfort of the sea to find himself. Little does he know, he is being followed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044158</url></doc>
