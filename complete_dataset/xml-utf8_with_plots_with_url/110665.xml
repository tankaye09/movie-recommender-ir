<plot>Love, revenge and collectibles. Max is obsessed with collecting the toys from Oaty Os, the cereal we've all cherished since 1941. His wife, Evelyn, is obsessed with the Shoppers Network. When it is announced that Oaty Os has been bought out by MegaloCorp and the famous toys that have kept Max so happy since his childhood will cease production, he will stop at nothing to complete his hallowed collection. Enter Employee 09182, Max's arch-nemesis and fellow Oaty Os fanatic. He is missing one important toy - a toy that Max has locked away in his workshop. Cutting through the haze of greed and commercialism, Max discovers what has truly been missing in his life...and she's glued to the television, purchasing trinkets and kitchen supplies. "Collect All Four" is a love story told without a single line of dialog. It reveals the isolation we suffer on our quest for material happiness and shows the beauty of hope and human contact.
