<plot>A guy comes home to his apartment and starts listening to his phone messages. There are nearly a dozen, all from Nancy. The messages are long and involved; sometimes Nancy is peeved with Sean for not picking up, for not calling, for leaving her hanging. But she also vacillates between pique and passion. When he finishes listening to them all, the phone rings again. He doesn't pick up at first, listens to her message for awhile, then picks up. What's in store for him?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341183</url></doc>
