<plot>A former medic returns from a mission in a war zone. Due to a severe injury, his face can only be described as monstrous. Fearing the reaction and rejection from society he is looking for a quiet place to settle. A vast industrial ruin seems to be perfect. But the godforsaken place is already occupied by someone - George. Fighting the alleged intruder ruthlessly, George doesn't understand that all this poor guy wants, is his peace. A existiantalistic drama about life, let live and death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083871</url></doc>
