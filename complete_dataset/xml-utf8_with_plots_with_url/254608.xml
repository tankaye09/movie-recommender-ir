<plot>Early 20th century, in a small port neighborhood of Corfu, Greece. Epistimi raises her children alone against a harsh historical and political background. Her husband spends the poor income of the family on alcohol. Rini, Epistimi's daughter, and Andreas, a decadent aristocrat occupied with smuggling, fall in love. Andreas and Rini cannot get married, because of Rini's low social status and lack of money. Andreas asks for a large dowry in order to marry her -he has to pay off a mortgage on his family's house. Epistimi offers him half of the money he asks for, since she must also think of her other children. To blackmail her, Andreas, persuades Rini to run off with him without marrying, but Epistimi once again does not give him the sum he asks for. Rini gets pregnant and her mother has no other choice than submitting to the blackmail. In triumph Andreas announces to Rini that they are going to get married, but Rini refuses and breaks their relationship. Despite the outcry against unmarried mothers, Rini finds a job in a factory. She manages to preserve her dignity and to remain firm on her belief that Love should have no Price.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254608</url></doc>
