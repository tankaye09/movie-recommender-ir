<plot>In film-noir tradition, as a police photographer takes pictures of the crime scene, a well-dressed corpse tells his story of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He's robbed the First Federal Bank, getting nearly a vault full. Chased by cops, he ducks into a building and finds an unlocked door leading him into a well-appointed office, where a surprise awaits him. A man with a revolver pointed at him, certain that he knows his visitor. The tale unfolds of tickets to Capri, a large bank withdrawal, a dutiful security guard, and a heartless woman. Will anyone make it to Italy?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093491</url></doc>
