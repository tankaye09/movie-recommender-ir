<plot>Jet Black is a down on his luck director. Once at the top of his game, Jet is now dangling at the end of his rope. Owing money to everyone and unable to get the next gig, the golden gates of Hollywood have crashed down on him hard. Threatened by the IRS, the mob, a lethal ex-wife, as well as a gun toting secretary, Jet Black needs a miracle. Enter Ross Maxwell, a simple guy leading an uneventful life in a small North Carolina town. Ross' estranged and wealthy father passes away and leaves millions in the bank. In order for Ross to inherit the money he must make a movie from his father's final un-produced movie script "Bassasouras", a terribly written screenplay about a mutant killer Bass swimming through the lakes of North Carolina wreaking havoc on a small town. Ross enlists the help of his unsuccessful stand-up comedian friend and they approach their idol, Jet Black, to take charge of directing the movie. Immediately, they attach Brock Chapman, the biggest soap opera star in the world, (who, un-beknownst to them, is a criminal on the run who just happens to look like the biggest soap opera star in the world) and attempt to make the movie on a $25,000 budget that they hope will be their big ticket to Dad's money and movie stardom. Be prepared to laugh, cry, and root for the underdogs in this very funny and heartwarming movie about everyday life and the personal struggles of The Unlikely's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598266</url></doc>
