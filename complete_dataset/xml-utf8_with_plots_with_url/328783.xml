<plot>A true giant of military history, Hannibal forged his formidable reputation during the Punic Wars of the second century B.C. Famed for his incredible fifteen day journey across the Alps and for his great victories over the Romans at Trebia and Cannae, he remained undefeated in battle until his raw armies were crushed by Scipio at Zama in 203 B.C., leaving Carthage at the mercy of the hated Romans. Superb on-location reconstructions and re-enactments convey the savagery of battle in the ancient world</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328783</url></doc>
