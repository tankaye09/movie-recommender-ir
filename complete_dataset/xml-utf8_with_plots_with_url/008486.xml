<plot>The scene is before the open door of a Chinese pagoda. A Chinese conjurer appears as if coming from the bowels of the earth, and causes a beautiful Chinese maiden to take her place on the stone steps of the pagoda. The maiden is suddenly transformed into the huge head of a Chinese hobgoblin who emits great volumes of smoke from his mouth. An American traveller then appears upon the scene and seizing a huge sword splits open the head of the hobgoblin, and from its centre appear three small Chinamen who dance about in a fantastic manner. Then the allied soldiers of England, France, Russia, America and Germany appear and from the place previously occupied by the Chinese hobgoblin there appears a lily, in the centre of which grows the figure of a beautiful woman representing the Goddess of Liberty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008486</url></doc>
