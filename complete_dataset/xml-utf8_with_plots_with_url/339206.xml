<plot>Living Past is about an old high school janitor, haunted by the ghost of a young student who was involved with a fatal accident due to the janitor's negligence. The janitor pleads with the security guard for his help; however, the security guard is skeptical of the janitor for he claims he sees this boy every night but the security guard never finds him. The janitor becomes upset that the security guard does not take him seriously. The janitor has closer encounters with this boy, becoming increasingly worried, as the security guard, with the lack of anything better to do, tries to get to the bottom of this janitor's ravings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339206</url></doc>
