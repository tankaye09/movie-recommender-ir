<plot>Meg suffers from an OCD-like neurological disease that enslaves her within the confines of her own controlled world. When all goes well, her issues with self image and control may seem a little odd, funny, or perhaps even unremarkably familiar. However, when the prospect of a past relationship comes back into her life, the conflict between her desires and her demons begin to play out. Through the first-hand glimpse of a day in her life we can see and feel how the seemingly simple task of getting ready for a date represents a lifetime of struggle for Meg.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363912</url></doc>
