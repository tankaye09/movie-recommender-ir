<plot>Inspector Willoughby is in London this time trying to track down famous jewel thief, Vampira Hyde. Sure enough, he encounters Hyde serving him tea at the local tea house but she turns out to be smarter than Willoughby thinks. Whenever Willoughby isn't looking, she swallows a "Jeckyll and Hyde" pill transforming her from the vamp that she is into a helpless, kindly old lady. Each time, Willoughby thinks he has the wrong lady and sends the "old lady" on her way. Willoughby sets up a variety of traps to capture Vampira but each time, she takes another pill returning her to the "old lady" appearance with the Inspector returning her to the tea shop. In the end, the Inspector finally gets wise and ambushes her from inside a huge diamond arresting her and confiscating her pills. He swallows all the pills himself to see if they work, resulting in his turning into several unlikely creatures such as the old lady, an outer-space alien, a yeti, a gorilla, and Woody Woodpecker!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?251204</url></doc>
