<plot>Sylvie Pearson thinks her dreams have come true when she meets Peter Weston. He is kind and loving and Sylvie quickly moves in with him. Then she becomes pregnant. But Sylvie was born with a rare mental disorder and her mother tries to persuade her not to have the baby. Rejecting medical advise, Sylvie gives birth to a daughter, Cally. With Peter away on business much of the time, Sylvie and Cally spend all their time together alone. Sylvie is inseparable from the baby she adores. Then one night, her dream life becomes a nightmare. She leaves her baby alone for a few moments and returns to find the cot empty. Within days, Peter disappears as well but, because of her mental condition, Sylvie has become the prime suspect in the investigation of Cally's disapearance. Alone and afraid, with the police watching her, she starts to look for her family. Eventually, she finds Cally. But what she discovers along with her baby is a web of deception and lies that will tear her life apart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?501280</url></doc>
