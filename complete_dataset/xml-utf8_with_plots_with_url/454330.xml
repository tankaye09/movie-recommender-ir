<plot>Raja Babu (Govinda) is a poor orphan adopted by a wealthy village couple (Kadar Khan and Aruna Irani). He is a typical country bumpkin, good-hearted but lacking in urban manners. He falls for Madhu (Karishma Kapoor) when he sees her photograph in a studio and chases her on his bike decorated with plastic flowers with his sidekick, played by Shakti Kapoor. Taken in by his smart appearance and impressive talks, she reciprocates his love but walks out on him with all villagers watching when she learns that he is no match to her urbane, well-educated self. It was particularly humilitating for his father as it happened in front of villagers who respected him highly. The movies takes several twists with a typical Bollywoodesque happy ending. Villains are nabbed by police but not before being beaten black and blue by the hero, boy gets his girl and parents are reunited with their son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454330</url></doc>
