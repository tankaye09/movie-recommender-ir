<plot>As Jon goes out for a while he leaves Garfield in charge of the house and warns him that there is to be no mischief or mess. Garfield usually obeys but as soon as Jon leaves, Odie has turned the house into a shambles. Armed with a hoover on his back Garfield must clean up the house before Jon gets back. His reward will be a huge lasagna. But hurry...the clock is ticking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210233</url></doc>
