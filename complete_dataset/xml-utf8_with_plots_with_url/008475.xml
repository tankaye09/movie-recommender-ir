<plot>A Child's War is the culmination of the year-long Virtual Video Project, an after-school program conducted by Global Kids, Inc. in collaboration with the Museum of the Moving Image. During the 2006-07 academic year, the students gathered regularly to learn about film production, global issues, and virtual worlds, producing A Child's War, a year-end project on the plight of child soldiers in Uganda. A Child's War is a short video that displays the students' spectacular understanding of both digital media and important international issues. Through A Child's War, the 18 young creators vividly illustrate a poignant story that documents the fictional life experiences of a former child soldier who has come to the International Criminal Court to testify against the warlord who forced him to murder hundreds of people, including his own family members.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008475</url></doc>
