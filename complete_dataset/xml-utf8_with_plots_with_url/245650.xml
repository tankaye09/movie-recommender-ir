<plot>In "Horno" an adult film director comes up with the ingenious idea of combining his porn flick experience with his passion for horror movies. After convincing a porn producer that his 'horno' movie is an advantageous idea, he begins to shoot his glorious vision of a zombie outbreak spread by sodomy. On set, he has to deal with all the usual problems of a story-driven porn production. Things really get out of hand though when the director's male lead's girlfriend has turned into a zombie after taking some new drug. He's also turning into a zombie himself, starting to kill his cast mates - who also turn into zombies. The director's dreams of fortune and fame soon become a nightmare when life begins to imitate art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245650</url></doc>
