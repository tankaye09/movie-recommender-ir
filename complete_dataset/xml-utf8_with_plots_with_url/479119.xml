<plot>The scene is in a powder house of a quarry. A sign on the wall reads "No Smoking." A laborer, after eating his lunch, takes out his pipe for a smoke. He throws the burnt match into a keg of powder, and a terrific explosion takes place. The scene then changes to a scene nearby. The wife of the man who has been blown up is eagerly watching the sky. Debris of all sorts falls around her, and finally her husband lands in a heap. He is picked up and brushed off, apparently none the worse for his experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479119</url></doc>
