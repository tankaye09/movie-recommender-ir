<plot>Juli√£o is a young farm worker who, one day, contracts leprosy. Overnight, the good mountaineers that were so friendly with him refuse to see him again, and he must be by himself in the far woods. Bathing in olive oil, as suggested by an old woman, proves ineffective. Now, he becomes violent, expressing his anguish against those who expelled him from the village.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?404599</url></doc>
