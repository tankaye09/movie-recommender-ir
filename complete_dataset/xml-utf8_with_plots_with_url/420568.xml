<plot>Painting Poetry is the poetic tale of a painter struggling to cope with the loss of his beloved, The Poet. With an upcoming exhibit, he clings to the memory of their last moments together in attempt to overcome a disinterest in painting and a growing indifference toward life. With death approaching swiftly, The Poet faces her own battles. However, we see through a sleepless night that her focus remained to restore The Painter's passion for painting and renew his faith in fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420568</url></doc>
