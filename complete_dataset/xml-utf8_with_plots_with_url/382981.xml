<plot>Mutti is back - and this time she's here full-length! After the success of the scandalous five-part serial »Alle lieben Mutti (Everybody loves Mom)« (2001) it was only a question of time, until Mom and her always neglected daughter Biggi would have to go through a full-length feature adventure. In »Mutti - der Film« they are pulled into a frantic mixture of »The X-Files«, »The Silence of the Lambs« and »The Cosby Show« - an action comedy close to madness. The turbulent plot starts harmlessly: On her way home, little Biggi buys herself a bag of treats in a candy store, filled with many dainties. And an ear. But this ear is not made of candy as Biggi soon discovers - it's able to read people's thoughts! What the girl doesn't know, is that she only got the bag of treats - and the ear - by mistake. A mysterious woman, all-dressed in black should have received the ear - and now she wants to have it! So does a weird, fat man. A frantic chase ensues, but Biggi manages to escape her pursuers and reach her home safely. Excited she tells Mom about her sensational discovery, but Mom has something else on her mind: the plumber. As everybody knows sex is Mom's favourite pastime so her daughter has to take second place. Blinded by the thunderstorm of her raging hormones, Mom doesn't realize the danger she's in when instead of the plumber the fat man arrives and pretends to be his replacement. Confused by Mom's sensual advances and unable to find the ear, he kidnaps Biggi. Mom uses the opportunity to have a fun night out on the town with her neighbour Mrs. Budweiser looking for quick sex and hard booze. But the upright brewery owner is able to make Mom feel guilty. So with the help of a newspaper-salesman, who she meets by accident, she starts looking for her daughter. Soon they find the fat man's hide-out and boldly enter his dark lair. But knowing our impetuous Mom, you can be sure: This won't go well for very long...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382981</url></doc>
