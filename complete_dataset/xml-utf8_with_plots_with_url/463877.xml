<plot>The Norwegian fans of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings-trilogy have received much coverage in the international press. For the first film, more than 400 people spent a week outside the biggest theatre in Norway, in order to get tickets for the worldpremiere of the first film. A year later, the distributor in Scandinavia created a Middle-Earth inspired themepark in the capital of Oslo, and more than 800 fans came to live in this community prior to the ticketsales for the premiere. The documentary "Ringens Disipler" ("Diciples of the Ring")follows these fans, as they once again bring their tents to the pavements outside the theatre in the wintery cold of Norway. In costumes, tents and camps inspired by the trilogy, they start the three weeks wait for the tickets to the world premiere of "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King". As we follow their days and nights in the tents, we learn that there is much more to the fans' interest than the obvious fake ears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?463877</url></doc>
