<plot>Cowboy Andy Fowler rescues a man from a burning cave. It turns out that the man is a member of a gang of rustlers, and out of gratitude, the gang makes Andy one of its own, letting him wear a green armband that signifies his status as a gang member. Margie Landers, in spite of her love for him, reports him to the sheriff when her father's cattle are stolen. The sheriff has two problems--one is that he is secretly in love with Margie, and the other is that he is actually the head of the rustler gang.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022619</url></doc>
