<plot>Trade shown, reviewed and released as "Heaven Only Knows," for a short while until the exhibitors (in mostly small town situations) started complaining that customers were staying away in droves because they thought it was a religious film. UA pulled it back, in the same release year, and retitled it "Montana Mike" and sent it back out again, one of the few instances where an original title and an alternate title occured in the same original release period or year, despite some sources that seem to think original and alternate and re-issue titles all came about in the same year. Actually it was a "religious" film or, to be more specific, a "religious fantasy" film. but it sold well in the stix as a Western, and worked well as one also. It seems that in Heaven, the Book of Life and The Book of Destiny are all out of balance because of one guy, a Montana saloon keeper and cold, ruthless killer (Brian Donlevy), and the problem is the angels forgot to make a entry in the Book of Life for him. So a Heavenly Messenger (Robert Cummings) named Michael---evidently a favorite name for angels in movies or else some people have long memories---is sent down to do what he can in getting the books balanced. Dance-hall girl Marjorie Reynolds and preacher's-daughter Jorja Curtwright help complicate the auditing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233665</url></doc>
