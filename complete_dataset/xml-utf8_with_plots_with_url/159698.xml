<plot>Young Caleb has just moved to NYC from his home in South Carolina. Facing a long and unsettling summer without friends or familiar sights, he wanders through Central Park in a lonesome search for adventure. Then he meets Tyke, a roguish boy who shows him the world from a new point of view - one that takes him straight to the heart of childhood imagination. As the boys grow closer, it becomes obvious that there is something more to Tyke... something magical that he passes on to Caleb. And the gift that he leaves him with is one that will stay with him for the rest of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159698</url></doc>
