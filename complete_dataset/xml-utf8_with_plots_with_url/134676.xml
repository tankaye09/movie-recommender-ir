<plot>For all the sweat, cash and time we proudly pour into our backyards, they should be much easier to maintain, right? Of course, Mother Nature has a mind of her own and is relentless in breaking down the order we work so hard to create. This special explores the obstacles nature throws up to thwart our best efforts as well as the tools and technology at our disposal to conquer the elements. The Science Channel goes behind the scenes at the Toro Company to marvel at the technology used to develop a lawn mower. We'll also uncover the science behind the art of composting and reveal why "dry rot" is anything but dry. This in-depth look at the science of the backyard featuring high-tech computer-generated images, hands-on demonstrations and the unique insight of host Steve Hanneman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134676</url></doc>
