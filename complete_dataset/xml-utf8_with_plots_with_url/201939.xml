<plot>Smedley and Chilly Willy are roommates in an Arctic home. Smedley is freezing and is anxious to leave while Chilly lives quite comfortably. Finally, Smedley decides to move to sunny Hawaii. Chilly, however, has grown quite accustomed to Smedley and doesn't want his "old pal" to leave. So he determines to sabotage all Smedley's forms of transportation. First, he sinks his boat, then he blows same boat up with a dynamite bomb. He "invents" many ways to get Smedley to Hawaii but all of them have been rigged to fail. Finally, Smedley accepts his fate and decides to live in a "new" home, the same Arctic home painted and designed to look like a Hawaiian beach shore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201939</url></doc>
