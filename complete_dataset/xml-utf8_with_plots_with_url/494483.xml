<plot>Since flunking out of sniper school, Jimmy's decided to follow his Uncle Bob's footsteps and enter the hit man business. After several botched efforts, he has yet to actually kill a target. With the use of witty dialogue and a hilariously heart-breaking twist, Shot is an entertaining look at a man caught up in a roller coaster of dramatic emotions in a very short period of time. Will Jimmy be able to put aside his emotional baggage and pull off his first hit? The answer is revealed in Shot, a dark comedy about love, lies, and long-range marksmanship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494483</url></doc>
