<plot>Embrace is the story of two people who meet and fall in love at a party held in a tower somewhere in the future. Noted for its haunting noir-ish look Embrace is a triumph of multimedia. Storz combined super 8 mm film, CGI (computer digital imaging), pixilation, digital animation titling, and film to video transfer. Renowned for his sculptures of ancient futuristic towers Storz has embellished the tale throughout with his unique artwork. Using both color and black and white film stock creates a notion of uncertainty between dream and reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176279</url></doc>
