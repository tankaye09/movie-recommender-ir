<plot>The people around the town of Sloan Junction think that George Parradine (John Eldredge) is just a harmless book salesman, but he heads a gang of crooks planning to rob and pillage on a large scale. Their base of operations is the Reynolds ranch acquired by Parradine's front man, Leo Straykin (Roy Barcroft), after killing the former owner. Needing money to finance their plan, they have rigged a scheme to cheat easterner Josh Taylor (Forrest Taylor) out of the $125,000 he is carrying to invest in the Reynolds ranch for a large group of people who want to settle there. To help check the titles and boundaries, Taylor has brought along a lawyer, Kenneth Jordan (Douglas Evans), and a surveyor, Johnny Bennett (George Nader), who is really Jack Reynolds, the son of the former owner who is trying to find out who murdered his father. Circumstances permit undercover Marshal Rocky Lane (Allan Lane) to join the outlaw gang as a gunman, and with him is his sidekick, Nugget Clark (Eddy Waller), an itinerant patient medicine peddler. Rocky is working to uncover the identity of the head man, and his efforts are hampered when Jack Reynolds tries to kill Straykin from ambush.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471277</url></doc>
