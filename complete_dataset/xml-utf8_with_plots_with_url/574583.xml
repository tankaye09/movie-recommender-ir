<plot>Disgusted with his life as an opium addict in China, the man returns home to the United States, only to become a victim of alcohol addiction. Realizing that alcohol is evil, the man gives up drinking and devotes his life to prohibition. Unable to recall his past, the man assumes the name of "John Smith" and begins to fight against the liquor interests led by Senator Mallon. Mallon's daughter Edith sympathizes with Smith's cause and the two fall in love. Mallon, determined to crush Smith, locates one of his opium companions from China, who swears that she is Smith's wife. Smith, unable to recall his past, refuses to deny the charges, and things look grim on the day of the Congressional vote on prohibition until voters from all over the country mob the streets in favor of the bill. Smith's bill sails through Congress and the woman confesses that she is not his wife. Her confession restores Smith's memory and thus freed from the past, he embraces Edith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574583</url></doc>
