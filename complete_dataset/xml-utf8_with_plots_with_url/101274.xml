<plot>"All in the Family" (1971) had several spin-offs, but none as popular as "Jeffersons, The" (1975). One of the highlights of the show was the wise-cracking maid, Florence Johnson, who constantly engaged in battles of wits with George Jefferson. In this short-lived spin-off sitcom, we learn she has quit her job as a maid for a career as a housekeeper at a fancy hotel. The show was quickly cancelled due to lack of ratings, however, and Gibbs, Marla returned to the "deluxe apartment in the sky" and explained that the hotel had burned to the ground, and continued to star in "Jeffersons, The" (1975) for the rest of it's run.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101274</url></doc>
