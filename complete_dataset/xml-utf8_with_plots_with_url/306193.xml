<plot>A policeman who has been fired by his chief after a violent quarrel is given a home by a farmer. As his host looks very much like a vagrant the peasant dubs him 'Pousse-Pierre'. Actually Pousse-Pierre will prove very handy since he will save Miette, the farmer's daughter, and manage - at the risk of his own life - to have the murderer of a miller arrested. His superior reinstates him and the young man can marry Miette.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?306193</url></doc>
