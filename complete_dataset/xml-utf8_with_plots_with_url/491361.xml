<plot>A prankish old bachelor tries a joke on a lady of considerable avoirdupois. He frightens her with a toy mouse. The lady faints, however, and when he attempts to hold her up he finds himself unequal to the task, and it all ends with his being crushed to earth in most ignominious fashion. An exceedingly funny situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491361</url></doc>
