<plot>Two rebel brother, Drake and Daniel, disguise themselves as Union soldiers in order to deliver a secret letter to a turncoat Union officer named Hatcher. When Drake gets injured, young Daniel is forced to deliver the message alone. But the mission goes awry and Daniel must flee camp with a meek northern photographer Benjamin, who has been framed for a murder he didn't commit. Unaware that they are being pursued by Hatcher, who has plans of his own for the letter, they embark upon an incredible journey that will test their courage, friendship, their views on war, and their very lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291625</url></doc>
