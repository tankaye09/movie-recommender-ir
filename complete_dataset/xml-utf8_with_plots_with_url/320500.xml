<plot>"Last Hippie Standing" is a video clip style portrait about the hippie generation. Thirty years ago, this was a movement which came to Goa to find something they couldn't find at home. Many returned, a few stayed. Goa, the hippie paradise of the 60's is our point where we start to search for "the last hippies". This former Portuguese colony in the south of India was for many the final destination after adventurous travels through Greece, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Dreamlike untouched beaches promised to be a new holy land, which was also the spritual basis for Alex Garland's novel "The Beach". After viewing historical Super8 material we started searching for the famous beaches and found a new youth culture which seemed to be similar to the old hippie culture. &lt;p&gt; Raver, Part-Time-Hippies, Backpacker und "normal" people enjoyed the beaches. We met people from Japan, Israel, Australia and the UK. Anjuna Beach is the center of the infamous Goa parties. Here, the millenium celebrations promised the best of all Goa parties. This is where the youth of the world demonstrated their understanding of fun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320500</url></doc>
