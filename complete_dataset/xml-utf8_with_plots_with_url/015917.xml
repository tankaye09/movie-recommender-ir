<plot>A street cleaner, whose job is cleaning the sidewalk of a boutique, always keeps his head very low. He only sees people's shoes passing by, not their faces. Nobody seems to care about him-except a pretty young woman. She always smiles at him friendly. When the woman's high heels appear, the cleaner will raise his head to watch her. The woman will give him a beautiful smile and then look at a pair of expensive shoes displayed in the window, as if she is looking at her lover. One day, the street cleaner sees her crying. To cheer her up, the street cleaner decides to give her a gift-the shoes she always watches in the window of the boutique.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015917</url></doc>
