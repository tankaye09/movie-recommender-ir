<plot>Three girls are very busy in the laundry. The chimney-sweep enters to clean the chimney. The girls see a chance for some fun, and pretending to be angry at being disturbed in the work, command the sweep to leave the place. He refuses and attempts to embrace the girl nearest him. At this the girls pounce on him, and dragging him to one of the washtubs, they proceed to give him a thorough cleaning. After lathering him, they pull him toward a high clothes-wringer and force him through. The girls then hand what is left of him on the line to dry. He soon recovers from his flattened condition, and dropping from the line rushes wildly at the girls. Two of them are pushed into tubs and the third receives the contents of his soot-bag as he makes a hasty exit. Very laughable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599990</url></doc>
