<plot>Before Tony can get to work on the first day of his new job, he manages to lock himself out of his appartment. To get back in he uses the his new security pass, which resembles a credit card. The card becomes damaged when it is used to open his front door, and then causes mayhem at work when the main computer fails to identify Tony as the new employee. The high-tech building is run by computer, which interprets its programming as meaning; "destroy all threats". The BUILDING is out to get Tony.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596482</url></doc>
