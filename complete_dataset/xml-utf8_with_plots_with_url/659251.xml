<plot>Too much tequila and the sweet sounds of mariachi music land the groom-to-be and three-quarters of his wedding party in Tijuana, Mexico. The problem? The bride-to-be is in Las Vegas, Nevada, expecting to get married in just a few hours. Fortunately for the groom, the best man passed out early enough not to end up in Mexico with his buddies, but now it's up to him to deceive the rest of the wedding party, deal with last-minute reception details, impersonate the groom, make sure the ordained minister is sober enough to perform the ceremony, keep the bride-to-be from running off with her male stripper crush, and keep himself from falling in love with the maid-of-honor -- again. If he can manage all that, and the groom-to-be can make it back to Vegas before the start of the wedding, then everything might just turn out all right. Maybe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659251</url></doc>
