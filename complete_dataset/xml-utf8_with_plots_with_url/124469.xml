<plot>This controversial film about the Daily Hindustan thinly disguised as the fictional Daily Mail, edited a character constructed as a composite portrait of Hindustan's owner Lotwala and editor Indulal Yagnik. It also lampooned the patron of the Ranjit Studio, Jamsaheb of Jamnagar, and his studio boss Chandulal Shah in a plot designed as a scabrous expose of the film industry's ethics.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?124469</url></doc>
