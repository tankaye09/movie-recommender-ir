<plot>We know who protects our streets: police officers are charged with keeping our cities safe. But what happens when criminals take to the seas, eluding capture in extremely sophisticated vessels, hoping to keep miles of open ocean between themselves and the authorities? That vast expanse of ocean is patrolled by the United States Coast Guard... and protected national security is their mission. Trained as cops, detectives, even SWAT team members, the Coast Guard plays a constant cat-and-mouse game with seafaring criminals. To stop the flow of narcotics and illegal migrants coming to the United States through maritime routes, they scan the seas for suspicious vessels, hunting down drug and immigrant smugglers. And High Seas Cops takes you with them. You'll be there as they approach the 450-foot Gur Maiden, a freighter taken hostage by stowaways armed with machetes. You'll follow them as they board unfamiliar and dangerous vessels, employing the latest technologies to outsmart drug traffickers carrying huge shipments of contraband to the U.S. You'll witness shocking discoveries as they board ships full of illegal migrants, finding people packed into squalid cargo holds in hopes of reaching the United States and a better life. And throughout, you'll experience the intense training of the Coast Guard's elite law enforcement divisions, watching them hone their talents as high seas cops. Come aboard... and experience an hour of real-life action, adventure and danger with High Seas Cops.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238996</url></doc>
