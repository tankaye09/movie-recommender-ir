<plot>The half-hour 16mm film focuses on the final months of Dr. Mickael M. Kannan, who died from Lou Gehrig's Disease last October. Kannan was Littman's pediatrician, and his dedicated care inspired Littman to direct the film. The documentary is a realistic portrayal of the devastation caused by Lou Gehrig's Disease, as well the struggle of a family to come to terms with the inevitable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343437</url></doc>
