<plot>This film covers a year in the life of a Saami family in Northern Norway. In particular we follow two teenage girls, Elle &amp; Inga, who are cousins. They are involved in the Saami traditional lifestyle of reindeer herding. But they are also teenagers in modern Europe. The films link with the traditional side of Saami life is Elle's mother, May-Torill. As well as being a teacher she lives the Saami life to the full and is a passionate believer in immersing the next generation in the traditional lifestyle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459344</url></doc>
