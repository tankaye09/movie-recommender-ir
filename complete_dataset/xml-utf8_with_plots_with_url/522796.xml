<plot>Film student Denver Shaw (Velvet) craves one thing that many young people crave these days: fame and fortune. What separates Denver from the others is her willingness to kill to get what she wants. When Denver decides to make a lurid documentary about Hollywood prostitutes, she runs into a major obstacle - she murders her first interviewee, a trashy psychotic hooker named Bunny, and makes the killing look like the work of an angry john. When another prostitute is found murdered, the media goes crazy and proclaims the murders are the work of a new serial killer: the Vice Stalker. Denver is overjoyed by the media hysteria and announces plans to make a reality-based film about the "Vice Stalker murders." Soon, however, someone begins stalking her and members of her cast and crew are being killed off. Will Denver survive this dangerous game and stop the other killer from exposing her secret?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522796</url></doc>
