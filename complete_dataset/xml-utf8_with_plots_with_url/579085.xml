<plot>The Hanna-Barbera-created Oscar-winning cat-and-mouse team of Tom &amp; Jerry returned to TV in an hour-long stretch of new adventures. Here, T&amp;J, after years of rivalry, have become the best of friends (and Jerry dons a red bow tie, so the animators would be able to "fragment" his movements), in episodes wherein they roamed the world competing in sports, enduring on-the-job misadventures, running afoul of dastardly villains, solving mysteries and helping others. In the first season, three 7-minute New Tom &amp; Jerry segments alternated with two 10-minute ones concerning a 40-foot purple ape, Grape Ape (voiced by Bob Holt) and his fast-talking beagle buddy, a carnival hustler answering to the unlikely moniker of Beegle Beagle (voiced by Marty Ingels), or "Beegley Beagley," as G.A. would lovingly refer to him. The second season ushered in 16 6-minute segments of The Mumbly Cartoon Show, a new Hanna-Barbera comedy/mystery concerning a snickering plainclothes man detective hound named Lt. Mumbly (voiced by the late Don Messick and patterned loosely after Muttley of Wacky Races [CBS, 1968-70] and Dastardly And Muttley In Their Flying Machines [CBS, 1969-71] fame) and his schlocky stooge, Shnooker (voiced by John Stephenson).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579085</url></doc>
