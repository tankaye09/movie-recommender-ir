<plot>On the day before Christmas, a boy from a well-to-do family is playing outdoors with his sled, when he notices a girl who is shivering in the cold because her family is to poor for her to have a coat. The boy gives her his coat and takes her to his home, where they play together for a while. He reads her a story about Santa Claus, but she refuses to believe it because Santa Claus has never come to her home. That night, as the boy lies in bed, he decides that he will force Santa Claus to visit the girl's house and give her some gifts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012427</url></doc>
