<plot>When the subject of a documentary turns up murdered, the documentarian shifts the focus of her movie to try and figure out what happened and why. Talia is a survivor. Kicked out of the house at fifteen, she's had to do whatever it takes pay her bills and make it through the day. She is far from perfect, but she is steadfastly trying to better herself and regain custody of her son. It is easy to see why documentarian Anna Corrin would be drawn to her as a subject for a movie. Anna films Talia as she moves from working as a prostitute on the streets to getting involved with an Internet porn company, and she slowly moves from being an objective observer to actively being involved in Talia's life. Everything is forever altered when Talia is found murdered. From this point on, Anna changes the focus of her movie to attempting to figure out what happened to her friend and why. She will soon discover that even under the impartial eye of the camera lens, there was a lot to Talia that remained hidden. As Anna gets closer to the truth and it appears that the answers involve high profile and influential people, her life and the life of her crew are in danger. Soon it becomes a struggle simply to get her movie seen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494372</url></doc>
