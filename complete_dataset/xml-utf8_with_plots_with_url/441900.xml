<plot>Each of us is given a portion of life, whether it lasts 27 years or 83, and most of us spend it consumed by the urgent, missing what is essential. But we are surrounded by things that have the power to take us beyond ourselves into the flow of what the ancients called "kairos" time. Contrary to the artificial clock time by which we spend our lives in incremental bits, "kairos" moves like a great river beneath even the most mundane of days. "Praying the Hours" tells the stories of eight interwoven characters impacted at just such epiphanal moments throughout one day. These are the chances they are given to glimpse the eternal, chances to step into a new life. Their own. "Praying the Hours" isn't any one person's story. It's everyone's story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?441900</url></doc>
