<plot>Giving in to the demands of his children, namely: Govindram, Rohit, Aarti, and his daughter-in-law, Sunita, Dhaniram (Kader Khan) distributes his wealth between the four of them. Rohit prefers not to participate in this, and remains devoted to his dad. Greed overtakes, Govind, Aarti, and Govind's wife, and they become arrogant, and ill-mannered. Even his daughter gets married without his consent to Shashi (Shashikiran). Dhaniram and his lawyer Batliwala (Anupam Kher) contact Dhaniram's twin brother Maniram, and together they get Dhaniram married to Bharati (Swapna), who is much younger than Dhaniram. Thus the beneficiary of Dhaniram estate is now changed to Bharati, and it remains to be seen whether this will have an impact on Dhaniram, Maniram, Govind, Rohit, Aarti, Snita, Shashim and others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?625714</url></doc>
