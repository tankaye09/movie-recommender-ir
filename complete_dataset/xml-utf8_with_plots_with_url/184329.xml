<plot>He and She (they remain nameless throughout) enter a theater, prepare for a performance and begin a two-person play. Portraying first graders they are suddenly in a real classroom competing in a spelling test. We follow their competition and bickering through elementary and high school as they try to earn love and acceptance. In high school they finally try to be a couple but He blows it with substance abuse, gets expelled and fails in a suicide attempt. She rejects him and goes off to success in college and career. But her talents and intelligence are not enough to find true love, getting pregnant before marriage and finding herself a victim of an abusive husband who abandons her to single parenthood. Throughout her journey her failed boyfriend has kept in touch with reports of his own changes from a cynical loser to a follower of Christ who writes and teaches from his faith. He and her Christian neighbor influence her to commit her life to Christ. Now with a toddler, She moves back to her home town. She sits with her old friend among the unpacked boxes in her new apartment and they transition back onto the theater stage for the last lines of the two-person show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184329</url></doc>
