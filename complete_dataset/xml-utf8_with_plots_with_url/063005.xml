<plot>Winner of the 2007 "Spirit of Sacramento Award" for "A Place Called Sacramento Film Festival." Crystal, a beautiful, self-absorbed 24-year-old, inherits a box of river rocks from her aunt. She is totally disgusted with the gift until her mother finds a school paper Crystal wrote when she was 8-years-old. It describes an afternoon on the river with Aunt Irma. At the river, Irma writhes with despair as she discloses her recent cancer diagnosis while little Crystal chatters with excitement. Through the innocence of a child, bedrocks that flank the American River, as far as the eye can see, become blessings and thankfulness, and Aunt Irma's grief turns into gratitude.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063005</url></doc>
