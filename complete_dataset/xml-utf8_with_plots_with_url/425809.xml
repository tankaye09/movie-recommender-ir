<plot>Rajan lives a wealthy lifestyle in Basantpur along with his mom; dad, Dindayal; a semi-senile paternal uncle, Bholey; and a widowed paternal aunt. During his childhood, while lighting Diwali fire-crackers, he accidentally set his friend's, Shanti, face afire, making her lose her vision. Full of remorse, he studies medicine, and decides to become an eye surgeon just to restore her vision. Years later he does qualify, becomes a surgeon in a Delhi hospital, while his dad is now the Municipal Chairman. Shanti, who lives a poor lifestyle, with her dad, Ramdas, the owner of a publication 'Praja Samachar', and her mom, travels to Delhi to have her eyes operated on. The operation takes place but she is still unable to see, and when they return home there is more bad news as Ramdas has been arrested for killing Dindayal's chauffeur, is found guilty, and sentenced to two years in prison. Questions that remain unanswered: Why did Ramdas commit this crime; will Shanti regain her sight; what impact will Ramdas' conviction have on Basantpur; and what will be the fate of Ramdas and his family after he completes his time in prison?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425809</url></doc>
