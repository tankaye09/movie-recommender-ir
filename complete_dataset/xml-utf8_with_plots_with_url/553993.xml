<plot>Vijay lives with his mother, attends college and is in love with beautiful Anita Malik, a fellow collegian who he would like to marry. When Anita is molested by Nagesh, Vijay intervenes, thus incurring the wrath of Nagesh's gangster father, Bhujang, who wants to do away with Vijay, who is now afraid as to what is going to happen to him and his mother. Bhujang hires a hit-man named Jagga to put an end to Vijay's life, but Vijay, though wounded and hospitalized, survives. And then Jagga is hunted down and killed, and Bhujang is warned not to even think of harming Vijay, for Vijay and his mother have an unknown protector, an ominous and deadly person, known as "The Don", and no one knows why the Don has chosen to protect Vijay and his mother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553993</url></doc>
