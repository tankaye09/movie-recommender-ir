<plot>Grown-ups become children again, as Wendy, John and the Lost Boys join Peter Pan once more. Wendy and the Lost Boys are dreaming of Neverland. This is strange, because they have all grown up. Tootles is a portly judge; Curly is a doctor; Slightly is a baronet. Wendy, now a wife and mother, decides that Neverland is in trouble and that they must find a way to go back. And so these respectable mothers and fathers put on their children's clothes to become children again. Armed with fairy dust, and Tinkerbell's replacement, Fireflyer, they fly off to Neverland in search of adventure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430382</url></doc>
