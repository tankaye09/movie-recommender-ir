<plot>Two bunco steerers playing with a Western cowboy try to "do him" by passing cards to each other. They finally show their hands, and one of the crooks holds the winning cards, but the cow puncher, having discovered their crooked work, covers the money with one hand, while he draws a revolver with the other, shooting one through the hat. The other bunco man runs away, but is followed by the cowboy, who continues to shoot. A real typical Western border scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650989</url></doc>
