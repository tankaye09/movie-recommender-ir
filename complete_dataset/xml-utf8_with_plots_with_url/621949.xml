<plot>Suspecting that something is amiss with their father's burial, teenagers Kenneth Tyler and his sister Corrie venture to his gravesite and make a horrific discovery: their father was not actually buried in the casket they bought for him. Worse, they learn that Fenton Breece, a perverse undertaker, has been grotesquely manipulating the town's dead. Armed with incriminating photographs, Tyler becomes obsessed with bringing Fenton to justice. But first he must outrun Granville Sutter, a local strongman and convicted murderer hired by Fenton to destroy the evidence. What follows is an adventure through the Harrikin, an eerie backwoods filled with angled roads, rusted machinery, and eccentric squatters - old men, witches, and families among them - who both shield and imperil Tyler as he runs for safety.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621949</url></doc>
