<plot>Max is confronted by his wife when visiting another woman. He is chased into the flat upstairs, where he conceals himself in a wardrobe before his furious spouse is thrown out. Removal men arrive to lower the wardrobe out through the window, but it falls to the street before they can secure it. The wardrobe is loaded to a cart, which in its turn placed on a train. The item is duly unloaded at the lady owner's new residence. The wardrobe topples over, smashing against the lady and revealing Max's presence. Max makes a swift getaway, blundering into the removal men as they climb upstairs. He makes for the railway station, takes the first train and arrives home, extremely battered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361838</url></doc>
