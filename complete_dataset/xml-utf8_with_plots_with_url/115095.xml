<plot>When Hillary James, a callous, cooking show diva fires her on air assistant during a live broadcast, Kay Sedia, a former Miss Teen Tijuana, is thrust into the limelight as the replacement. This is Kay's moment! She squeezes into her pageant dress and races to Hillary's side. But after Kay upstages Hillary, Hillary becomes enraged and fires Kay, blasting her with a steady stream of biting put downs. This ignites a firestorm in the tabloids; Hillary's reputation and ratings plummet. There's just one way to recover. If Hillary can hire Kay back as her assistant, she can redeem her reputation and at the same time get the Hispanic audience. Hillary's future depends on Cooking With Kay.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115095</url></doc>
