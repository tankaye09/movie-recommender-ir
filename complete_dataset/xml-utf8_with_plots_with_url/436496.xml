<plot>This is the story about a person born during the time of WW2 evacuation and who quickly turned from a modest Jewish boy Joseph into a cruel and cynical crowned thief, ruthless to everyone. The person, who once lost, forgot, traded his present name by becoming simply a Baron... Streets of modern city are changed into wooden pavements of a provincial town in the beginning of 50th, high society parties are turned into gangsters' meetings, Mediterranean landscapes - into dirty railway stations of Russian suburbs, detective's office of Stalin times - into a high security prison of 70th.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436496</url></doc>
