<plot>It is already firmly entrenched in the public's psyche that more young people die from suicide than from road accidents. It's much less well known that it in many countries it is older adults, particularly elderly men living alone, who are most at risk from suicide. A Quiet Exit investigates this silent phenomenon of suicide among Ireland's elderly. The documentary tells the stories of five elderly characters and of the difficulties faced by them, such as social isolation, physical illness, loss and depression. Their poignant stories serve to highlight the many ageist attitudes of an increasingly youth-focused Republic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015066</url></doc>
