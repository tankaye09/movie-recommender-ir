<plot>The magician enters, removes a covering from a small table, shakes it before the audience to show that there is nothing concealed inside, then he draws attention to the table to show that there is nothing behind or under it. A wash tub which the magician satisfies his audience is empty, is then produced and placed upon the table, instantly the tub becomes filled with water and upon being covered with a cloth the magician fires his pistol direct at the tub with the extraordinary result that when the cloth is removed a flock of ducks are seen swimming naturally in the tub. Once more hiding the tub from view with the table cloth the audience is gratified upon its removal by seeing the face of a beautiful lady like Venus from the waves. The lady jumps gracefully from the table and walks off the stage to the astonishment and disappointment of the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418377</url></doc>
