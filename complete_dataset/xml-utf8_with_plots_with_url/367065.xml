<plot>An unauthorized biography of Metallica, featuring interviews and exclusive film footage. Intelligent, thought-provoking and always pushing the boundaries of metal music, Metallica have remained at the top of their game whilst other groups have fallen by the wayside. Nevertheless, the band's dynamic has changed drastically since they first came together in 1982, with them working their way through numerous bassists and continuing after the tragic death of bassist Cliff Burton. Always keeping the fans guessing, Metallica have managed to appeal to the mainstream whilst never compromising their artistic integrity as countless new generations of fans discover their music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?367065</url></doc>
