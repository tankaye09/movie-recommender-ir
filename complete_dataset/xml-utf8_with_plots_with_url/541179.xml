<plot>Despite the daily challenges of being one of the few Jewish students at the local Christian prep school, both Jordan Simms and his parents know it's the best place for him to prepare for college. Unfortunately, their reasons are worlds apart. Jordan wants to play Division One Lacrosse, and the upcoming visit of a Princeton scout for a pivotal game has Jordan on the verge of realizing his life's dream. However, Jordan's parents have little but contempt for their son's goals. Their sole focus is Jordan's future as a high-powered lawyer, and how his success will reflect best on them. Jordan's teammate, Chris Wheatley, is the youngest son of the school's domineering Headmaster, whose attitude towards Chris mirrors the harshness Jordan receives at home. Headmaster Wheatley has seen both of his eldest sons earn MVP trophies, and he's determined to see Chris earn a third, no matter who gets hurt along the way. Jordan often finds himself at odds with Chris, whose heartfelt belief in Christian dogma clashes with Jordan's skepticism. The boys' friendship is even more stressed when their winning Coach, who's also Jordan's mentor, is fired just days before the big game. Furious over this injustice, Jordan wants to strike back, but Coach Edwards warns him to choose his actions carefully. Jordan's future is in no one's hands but his own. On game day, the conflict comes to a head when Jordan, clearly the most talented player on the team, is benched. With the Princeton scout watching in the stands, Jordan's anger at being robbed of his dream leads him to confront the very choice about which Coach Edwards had warned him. Meanwhile, the Headmaster's humiliation of Chris pushes him to attack the false idols that are the true focus of his seemingly pious father's worship - an emotional breaking point that will change these two boys forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541179</url></doc>
