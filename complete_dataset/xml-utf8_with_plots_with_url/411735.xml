<plot>When a rival gang guns down his best friend over drugs, twenty-year-old Slam vows payback. But in order to exact his revenge, he'll need money he's stashed away, money that he can only get his hands on by accompanying his retiring apartment manager, Marcel Washington, on his family homecoming trip down South. Both men need each other and despise one another, and as Slam acts out on his plan, they form a bond that will become thicker than blood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411735</url></doc>
