<plot>"A summer man and two young ladies are out fishing in a skiff. The young man, rod in hand, is playing a big bass, and the two girls are excitedly watching him. One is handling the net, and as the bass is drawn up by the side of the boat, she makes a wild plunge for it. In doing so, she loses her balance and overturns the boat, and all three are tumbled into the water."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007632</url></doc>
