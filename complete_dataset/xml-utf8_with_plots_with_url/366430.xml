<plot>Sushil Kumar lives a middle-class lifestyle in Riksapur in the District of Bhagalpur, located in a country called Mundustan, along with his widowed mom, Kamini, an unmarried sister, Shobha, and his pregnant wife, Sunita. Shobha falls in love with a wealthy man named Kumar, introduces him to her family, gets their approval and gets married. Shortly thereafter she disappears, and the Kumar family realize that Shobha has been abducted by her husband, who belongs to a gang of of women-kidnappers. Sushil is determined to find her whereabouts, gets a job with the Police as a Sub-Inspector, does his work honestly and diligently and is publicly honored. Thereafter he is assigned by CBI Officer Sangram Singh to a secret mission to locate and apprehend smugglers, thieves, and women abductors, which can only be done after he dons the guise of jailed gangster Kanwar Lal, his look-alike. Sushil accepts this assignment in the hopes of being re-united with his sister - not knowing that he is putting not only his very own life but also the lives of Sunita and Kamini in serious danger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366430</url></doc>
