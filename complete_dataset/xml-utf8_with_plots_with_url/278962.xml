<plot>A series which follows Irish comedian Tommy Tiernan over two years on his journey from the biggest venues in Ireland to the bottom of the US comedy food chain, and beyond. Cutting from his performances at a sold-out Vicar Street to playing to a handful of locals in smoky back-street US clubs, Tommy finds himself sweating more than usual for his pennies! In this series, he also talks candidly about what it's like to be a comedian, confirming that the business of being funny is not always a laughing matter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278962</url></doc>
