<plot>A shapely young actress puts her troupe of dogs through numerous performances. One of the canines is seen stretched out on a board apparently dead. Another, dressed as his widow, is seen weeping over his corpse. Soon a small dog, dressed as a policeman, and riding on the back of a large dog, comes in view and puts an end to the widow's sorrow by waking up her hubby. Another dog mounts a ladder, and with his paws draws the picture of a cat on a small blackboard. Another turns back somersaults, while still another walks on his front paws. A fine picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429224</url></doc>
