<plot>A very popular lunch time talk show in its day in Toronto. The well-liked host, similar to TV Ontario's movie host Elwood Glover, often took his chatty show on locations such as the annual Canadian National Exhibition. The public was invited to be in the audience and often it was their first glimpse of how a live show worked in the days when there were but a handful of Toronto and Buffalo networks to choose from. Guests were actors and singers such as Teresa Brewer, who would mingle with the audience afterwards. The show was broadcast from the CBC studio in Toronto and lasted most probably into the early seventies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?347499</url></doc>
