<plot>A couple of relationship-challenged people try to find love over a party sex line. Reluctant to reveal her true identity, Betty uses her mother's first name as an introduction to the wonderful-sounding fellow, Arnold. She is shocked that they are able to turn each other on over the phone, and promptly decides that he is the man of her present-day dreams. After some clever detective work (as they had hung up before exchanging phone numbers), she locates him, and they go out on a date. Surprisingly, they don''t click in-the-flesh as they did out-of-the-flesh. She doesn't give up, and subsequently discovers lover-boy has a hang-up with liars. Betty tries to get the advice of Arnold's psychologist brother but, predictably, the revelation of her false name makes Arnold go cuckoo. Meanwhile, Ronnie (Betty's best friend) tests the waters of phone sex, and dates a smoothie who succeeds in seducing her. After being left high and dry, she considers suicide. All in a day's work in the pursuit of love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530098</url></doc>
