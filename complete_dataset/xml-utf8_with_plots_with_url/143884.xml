<plot>Inspector Varun Saxena successfully apprehends Pilot Baba's son for running over and killing a fellow police inspector by the name of Deodhar. But Pilot's cunning advocate, Indrajit Diwan, has his son proved innocence, and set free. When Varun confides of his frustrations with his garage-mechanic friend, Suraj, he decides to study law and assist Varun. But when Suraj is arrested by Varun for attempting to rape Mrs. Deodhar, their friendship ends, and Suraj is sentenced to several years in prison. And then Mrs. Deodhar is killed and the evidence points to Varun, who is also arrested, charged and imprisoned in the same prison as Varun, who cannot wait to avenge his humiliation. And this time there are no rules - whatsoever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143884</url></doc>
