<plot>Saroj lives a poor lifestyle in Nagpur along with her widowed mom, Leela, and a younger sister, Nanhi. She gets job as a singer and dancer in Bombay and relocates there. Upon arrival in Bombay, she meets with a young man, Ajit, and the couple keep on meeting and eventually fall in love especially after she finds out that Ajit is the younger brother of the owner of the drama/dance company, Ranjit. Circumstances compel her to re-locate to Nagpur and seek employment with another dance/drama company run by Chunilal. A frantic Ajit, very much in love, decides to follow her to Nagpur, and visits her mom and sister. It is from here he finds out that Saroj is also in Nagpur. He locates the dance/drama company and does meet Saroj - only to find out that she has changed her name to Mary D'Souza. Ajit will eventually discover that Saroj had witnessed the murder of Chunilal and the killer(s) are now out to silence her - and whoever else dares to come in their way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?414353</url></doc>
