<plot>The lives of many can be affected by the actions of one. Eric Wallace, Jeff Woods, and Norman Garcia have taken a part in the drug trade as means of paying for graduate school, but soon discover that their decision had lead to the death of their closest friend. After being kicked out of graduate school on a failed drug transaction, Eric returns home to find that the mistakes of his past have had an effect on all of those around him. The Intertwined explores the entangled lives of three men and how in one day-- each of their lives are changed forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566689</url></doc>
