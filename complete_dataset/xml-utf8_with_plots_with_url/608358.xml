<plot>Seventy-seven-year-old Holocaust survivor Alice Zuckerman never gave up hope she would find her family, lost after the Second World War. When scribbled notes on torn paper reveal clues to her past, Alice and her family reunite. Alice takes us on a moving journey through old Eastern Europe, a world that seemingly disappeared through Nazism and communism. Yet the world of Alice's childhood remains vital in the hearts of the people she meets along the way. Time Apart: A History of Hope is a story that proves, as Alice Zuckerman says, "Hope is the last thing to die."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608358</url></doc>
