<plot>Benched: The Corporate Takeover of the Judiciary tells the story of how big business poured money into a judicial campaign in the name of "tort reform." The US Chamber of Commerce is suspected of funneling millions of dollars into the Illinois Supreme Court race on behalf of the Republican candidate who won. Tobacco giant Phillip Morris, which contributes to the US Chamber of Commerce, currently has a 10.1 Billion Dollar judgment for fraud on appeal before the Illinois Supreme Court which may now be reversed with an additional Republican on the bench.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065125</url></doc>
