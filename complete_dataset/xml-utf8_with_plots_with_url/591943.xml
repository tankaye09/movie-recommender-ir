<plot>The Song is a true independent film partially funded by - and this could be a first in the Canadian film industry - a bottle drive. Michael Peterson's debut is about the late night happenings amongst the staff and patrons at a public library in downtown Calgary; specifically, the amorous effects that one song has on these individuals. Using some of the conventions of the music video by creating knowable characters through identifiable stereotypes, The Song isn't the kind of one-off piece that infects so many other low-budget films that rely solely on a build up to a post-hoc gag to propel all narrative momentum, rather it begins with the gag and lingers until the motive behind the act is revealed. Leaving us grateful that so many Calgarians were willing to part with their empties when Peterson's crew came calling.
