<plot>Late night, Edsel sits alone waiting in his van until a couple begs for a ride to a nearby hospital. With pregnant Rita in pain and Miguel pleading, Edsel reluctantly gives in not knowing the consequences of his decision. A short trip becomes a headache as he dodges accidents and garbage bins while the incessant arguing of the dysfunctional couple tests his patience. After he kicks the couple out and drives away, his conscience gets the best of him. He takes them back in. At the hospital, a cold heart warms when Edsel receives a gift from grateful father-to-be Miguel. Later that evening, parked back in his spot, Edsel again sits alone. An alarm clock goes off revealing his original intentions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425228</url></doc>
