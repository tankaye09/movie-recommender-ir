<plot>Here is an opportunity to witness how the people of the East are ferried across a body of water. Unlike the ferries of our country, where huge boats are in use, the strange people have hung an immense raft on cables across the stream and the raft is pulled across. There is no possible danger, as should the cables part the raft would float, being made of heavy wood, held together with iron stays. This improvised ferry is loaded down with passengers, and several traders are accompanied by pack-mules laden with merchandise. Very interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010238</url></doc>
