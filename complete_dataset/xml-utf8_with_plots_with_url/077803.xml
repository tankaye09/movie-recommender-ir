<plot>In this picture we see one very important adjunct to any well conducted siege. The teams are straining at their traces, in order to move the heavily loaded wagons over the rough roads through the country. It is a successful General who always manages to keep his commissary department close to his men, as he may as well give up the struggle as to attempt to fight on short rations or without ammunition.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077803</url></doc>
