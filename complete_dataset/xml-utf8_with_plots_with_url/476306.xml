<plot>Based on the popular Manga/Animated Film Series, Sanctuary: The Movie is the live action version of Sanctuary telling the story of two boys who survived the Khmer genocide in Cambodia and now try to create their own sanctuary in Japan. Asami is going into politics to become a national leader, seeking to create a new and better Japan, whereas Hojo wants to improve Japan by "infiltrating" and changing the other side of Japanese society, the Yakuza, becoming one of their bosses and most influencial members. Together, they are working their way up, each if them in his very own way, just to fulfill their dream: creating their very own sanctuary in a world that has gone mad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476306</url></doc>
