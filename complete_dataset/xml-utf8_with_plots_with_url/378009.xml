<plot>Children are mysteriously vanishing from a suburban reserve and the community is in an uproar. As worried parents demand action from their bewildered chief, a grandmother reminds everyone of the long forgotten Tso'sq'aya, a ravenous witch that once stalked their town years ago. Drowned out by the angry calls of people blinded by fear, she tells her teenage grandchildren, Mel and Lewis, to avoid the witch by listening to the stories of their elders. Mel disregards her grandmother's advice and plans to meet her friend David at one of many summer parties happening on the waterfront. When myths and reality finally collide, Lewis must use the past to defeat an ancient evil and save his sister's life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378009</url></doc>
