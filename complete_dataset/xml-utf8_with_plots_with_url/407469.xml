<plot>Willie has been drinking a lot of bleach lately, and his robotic singing bass is telling him to do things...unspeakable things! Can his friend Richie put a peaceful stop to his bad behavior, or will Richie be forced to shoot him in the back of the head after Willie kills a coffee shop clerk with a rubber fish? To find out watch this hilarious short film, or just reread the previous sentence and take an educated guess.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407469</url></doc>
