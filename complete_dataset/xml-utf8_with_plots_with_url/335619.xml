<plot>A woman swimmer loses her presence of mind and is carried out with the tide. The Life Guards are called into action, and at the risk of their lives, rescue her and bring her to the shore where she is resuscitated. Every movement in this subject is plainly seen and shows the mode of treatment given by the lifesavers at Atlantic City to those whom they rescue from the surf. This, by the way, is also an excellent picture of the Beach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335619</url></doc>
