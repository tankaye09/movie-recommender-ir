<plot>At a unique Edinburgh bakery, a community of workers with learning disabilities makes a variety of organic breads for daily delivery to shops and cafes in the city. The workers interact using individual expressions, repetitive speech and sign language, revealing intricate social relationships with each other and their support workers. In what can seem a chaotic workplace, there is a mix of sounds that can approach levels of white noise amidst the carefully structured everyday process of bread production. The featured bakery is part of a centre inspired by the ideas of Rudolph Steiner where the workers realise their potential for self-discovery and creativity in a social environment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082060</url></doc>
