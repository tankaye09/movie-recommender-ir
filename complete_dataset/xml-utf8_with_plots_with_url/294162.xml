<plot>He is a tower of four decades of culture. His works are admired and despised, hated and critically aclaimed. A television crew has followed Klaus Rifbjerg for half a year in 1999 to capture the author, his private life, the publisher, the hunter, the friend, and the life cheater. The documentary is not exactly a portrait, but deals with the stuff literature is made of.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294162</url></doc>
