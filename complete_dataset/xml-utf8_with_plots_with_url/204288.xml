<plot>Three friends are having dinner. Jenny is waxing on about her fabulous sex life with boyfriend Ben. In exasperation, Cheryl interrupts. She announces her frustration with three months of celibacy. James, gay, tells her it should be easy to find a man - just ask the first one who passes by. She heads outside to test his theory. Jenny thinks Cheryl's drunk and a fool, and she won't go to watch, but Jimmy does. Cheryl stops a young man wearing a headset. Will he agree to her proposition? Does Jimmy's theory need refinement?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204288</url></doc>
