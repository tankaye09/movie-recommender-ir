<plot>Three teenagers; Jack, Kevin and David all live in a, what seems empty,village. Kevin suggests that the three of them spend a night in a local haunted house where a killer had lived 19 years previous. With some persuasion Kevin gets them to spend the night in house. During the early hours of the next morning Jack wakes up in serious pain and has very violent images going through his head. He sees best not to tell his friend but they suspect something is up. What we soon learn is that Jack is possessed by the killer that used to live there and he starts a murderous rampage! It's up to Kevin and David to stop him before it is too late!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291768</url></doc>
