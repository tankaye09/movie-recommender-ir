<plot>Hip Hop Harry is a bear and the world's best youth counselor. He started his after-school program, Hip Hop Central, because he truly believes that kids need a positive place to learn, play and discover. Outside of being a youth counselor at Hip Hop Central he works as a rapper/singer/dancer for kids and families around the world. Hip Hop Harry lives and breathes Hip Hop in an old school sort of way but he's hip to the current trends. He loves to rap and dance along with the kids and he believes that a beat and a rhyme can solve any problem. Hip Hop Harry is 100% positive in all he does. He uses hip hop as a vehicle to spread positive and enlightening messages to both kids and adults. Hip Hop Harry believes that kids should be self-sufficient, disciplined, educated, cooperative, creative, healthy, respectful, open minded and most of all fun! Hip Hop Harry enjoys a very healthy lifestyle. He is a well rounded, healthy, positive bear who loves music, dance, basketball, reading, learning, adventuring, making new friends and keeping life positive. He is never mean spirited but has a great sense of humor...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239940</url></doc>
