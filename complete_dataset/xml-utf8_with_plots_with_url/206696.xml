<plot>An original comedy that irreverently lampoons one of Hollywood's most famous stories, Fun Size takes us on a mind numbing adventure - where all the confusion a writer can muster finally has a home. A once in a lifetime opportunity encounter for "Mr. Blake", As he is pitching his original play, The Night Shift, to the living legend (22 year old), French stage director - "Pierre". Shakespearean translator need not apply - we have an oratorical genius guiding us through vast dimensions of imagination in "Mr. Blake's" bold and completely original retelling of stories we've all seen a hundred times. The story is weaved in the language of comedy - a dialect that will no doubt move the very deep waters of your soul. Will "Pierre" move swiftly and gracefully to bring this revelation to the public or will "Mr. Blake" suffer the doomed fate of a prophet in his own time. Fun Size is the just and only answer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206696</url></doc>
