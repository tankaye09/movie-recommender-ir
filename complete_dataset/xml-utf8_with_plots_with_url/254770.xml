<plot>"I'd rather..." is the story of a disgruntled, twenty-something Chicago trial lawyer who realizes he'd rather be a filmmaking philanthropist than an attorney. This heartfelt story develops into an unanticipated emotional and psychological trip back to the childhood roots of this now attorney trying to come to grips with his past, present and future realities, all the while assessing the true effects of one person in another's life. It follows the footage of a five-year journey and mission to make a movie with his friends with the intent to donate $2.6m of the proceeds to a critical non-profit organization dedicated to fighting a fierce murderer: Spinal Muscular Atrophy, the number one genetic killer of children under the age of two. Ultimately, "I'd rather..." demonstrates the battle against all odds leaving one profound question: When you learn the preciousness of life the hard way, how far would you push yourself to reach your greatest dream?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254770</url></doc>
