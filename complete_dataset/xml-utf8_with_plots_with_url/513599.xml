<plot>Just how obsessed are we with celebrity? Tom and Reed are going to find out, no matter what it takes. In STAR TRASH (a Super Size Me-type documentary) two small town guys suit up and dive into celebrity trash bins. When they auction off the items they find, they are shocked at how much people are willing to pay for treasures like Paris Hilton's used toothbrush. Quickly, the media latches on, giving the Star Trash Guys their own taste of celebrity. Articles are splashed across the web. Interview offers pour in from print publications, as well as radio and television stations, including NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox News. STAR TRASH explores serious and historic aspects of celebrity in interviews with pop culture experts, sociologists, psychologists and media experts. A peak into the lives of crazed fans, an exclusive paparazzi star hunt and the scoop on how much people actually paid for Paris Hilton's used toothbrush and dental floss add to this wild ride through our obsession with fame.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513599</url></doc>
