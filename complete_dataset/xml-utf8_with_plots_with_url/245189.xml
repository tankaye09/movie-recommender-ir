<plot>As the scene opens a safe robber is shown busily engaged in his preparations for blowing open a safe. As he lights the fuse, Hooligan comes in by a window and frightens him away. Holligan is no sooner on the scene, however, when the safe explodes with a terrific crash. Hooligan goes down in the debris and as he arises to inspect the ruins, the fat policeman rushes in and arrests him as the malefactor. An exceedingly comical and catchy subject. Well done throughout.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245189</url></doc>
