<plot>This documentary goes over more than hundred years through the story of all the documentary images made in Argentina, but placed in the context of the economical development in Argentina, which makes it a very interesting way of understanding the reality of a country like this one. In this manner you begin with the first takes made in the ninteenth century, including the famous take of the operation made by Dr. Posadas, throughout all the outstanding documenatry films from the silent era to the talkies, and colour. The documentary contains many explanations made by the great argentine documentalists, like Miguel Perez, Gerardo Vallejos, Humberto Rios, Rodolfo Hermida, Federico Urioste, and many more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241327</url></doc>
