<plot>An aspiring film-maker with a camcorder produces a documentary on the subject of fans and fanatics of the TV show "X-Files". Along with interviews with some of the shows more devoted (or deranged) followers, viewers are also given a look at the life of X-File merchadise hawkers, network employees, and even some of the actors from the program. In addition to getting some of their thoughts on show itself, this documentary also looks at the greater phenomenon of fandom, and why some people become obsessed with TV and movie characters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662174</url></doc>
