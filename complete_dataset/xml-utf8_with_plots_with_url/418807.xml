<plot>We are all surrounded by tools which civilize our society and extend our lives. However, they never alter us. Technology has become the most poignant contradiction of the modern world. It has offered us the ability to speak with almost any person on the planet at any moment of the day or night, yet our dependence on it threatens to destroy the intimacy and the beauty of real human communication. As we attempt to become closer to one another through the use of technology, we find ourselves becoming more and more like the cellular phones we use each day. A teenager Cindy gets upset and suspicious when her boyfriend Roy fails to answer her phone calls over and over. Walking in his college, she finally spots him calling a different person, upon having ignored her phone calls, she thinks, and then starts ignoring the phone calls by him who has no idea of the reason of her anger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418807</url></doc>
