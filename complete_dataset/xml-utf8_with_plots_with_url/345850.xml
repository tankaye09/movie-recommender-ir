<plot>In a bar, a man (Joe Marzano) stares at an earring, remembering a woman (Carol Slade) from his past. He recalls idyllic days at the beach and is overcome by a sense of loss. Filmmaker Marzano first dramatized this situation as his _Mer, La (1952)_ (qv), and he reworked that short into "Lovelost," which can also be seen as the closing segment of his _Trilogy (1961)_ (qv).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345850</url></doc>
