<plot>Kishinchand has taken to a life of crime, namely that of forging passports, and for that is under surveillance by the police. Upon his wife, Shanti's, and son, Pyarelal's insistence, he decides to give up all criminal activity and become honest. Then Shyamlal approaches him to make a fake passport, which he does, for a suitcase full of gold bars. Shyamlal escapes, but Inspector Shinde confronts Kishinchand and in the scuffle that follows, Shinde gets killed. Kishinchand re-locates to London, England, where he is now known as underworld Don, King. He has given up on his wife and son and believes they had been burned alive in a fire during Diwali. Now years later, a young man approaches and informs him that he is Pyarelal, and that Shanti is still alive in India. Kishinchand is overjoyed, and invites his wife to come to London right away, only to find out that the man claiming to be his son, is really Ronnie, a con-man and smuggler. Kishinchand is re-united with his real son and wife and all seems to be going well, until he finds out that the man claiming to be his son is really Ram Shinde, the son of the Police Inspector he had accidentally slain, and is really out to kill him. Not only is Ram after Kishinchand's life, but a woman named Sonia Singh also wants him dead, as due to his slaying Shinde, her innocent father was convicted for this crime and spent 14 years behind bars. The question remains, where is the real Pyarelal, and who will finally succeed in killing Kishinchand?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445740</url></doc>
