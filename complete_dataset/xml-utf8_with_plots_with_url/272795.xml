<plot>An ardent devotee of Devi Maa Sherawaali, Lakshmi lives a poor lifestyle in a small town along with her widowed mother. One day, while at the Devi Maa Mandir, she comes to the assistance of a wealthy male, Haribabu, who approves of her, and gets her married to his son, Prakash. The wedding takes place, and Lakshmi re-locates to live with Prakash in Mumbai. She will soon find out that Prakash was forced to marry her, and is in love with his sweetheart, Ratna Choudhary. Lakshmi decides to assert herself, and soon wins over Prakash. It is only when Haribabu travels to Mahabuleshwar for a business trip that she will find that Prakash still loves Ratna, had merely feigned to love her, and is now involved in a conspiracy to kill her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272795</url></doc>
