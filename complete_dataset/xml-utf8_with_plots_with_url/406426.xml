<plot>A divorced woman seeks new sexual adventures in this erotic tale. What she doesn't count on is that her new lover will take her as a hostage and hold her against her will in an abandoned, furnished warehouse. But is she really a hostage? It is revealed that after the first days, the door is never locked and she has always been free to go. After participating in several sexual adventures, including watching her lover have sex with another woman and having sex with another man whose face she never sees, she does leave. But after awhile, she does return. There she finds a series of tapes of previous exploits and evidence of who her lover really is. Tracing him to his home with wife and kids, she turns the tables on him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406426</url></doc>
