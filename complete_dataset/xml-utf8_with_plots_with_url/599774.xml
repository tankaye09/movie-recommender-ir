<plot>Trouble. Always seems to find you on a dark and lonely road. And it has been a long drive for Gina and Lucy as they return home from the funeral of Sarah, Gina's cousin. Reminescing about Sarah, the two are still shell-shocked over Sarah's bizarre suicide. Suddenly, a hitchhiker dressed in a white gown appears in front of their speeding vehicle. Would you mind giving me a lift? Gina and Lucy go against their better judgment and give the woman a ride. This woman, however, begins asking very odd questions of the two, raising their fears that something is not quite right about her. When the car breaks down, Lucy and Gina soon discover that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599774</url></doc>
