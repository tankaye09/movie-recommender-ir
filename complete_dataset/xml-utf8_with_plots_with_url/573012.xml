<plot>A ranch foreman, rebuffed by his boss' daughter, turns the ranch into a tourist mecca. The girl leaves the ranch, but eventually she returns with her new fiancé, who she says is a rich European, and they plan to get married at the ranch. Her engagement doesn't discourage the foreman, however, and finally her fiancé orders his servants to kidnap him and keep him under wraps until the wedding. The foreman finds out some damaging information about his love's "rich European" fiancée, and has to find a way to escape captivity and stop the wedding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573012</url></doc>
