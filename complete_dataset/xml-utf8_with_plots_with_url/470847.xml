Many were busted or involved on drug related issues. Especially, footy players. After many months of hard work, tens of thousands of dollars spent on this short film, we made this film for all those who are involved in sports, from teachers to coaches, professionals players to professional consultants, especially close family and friends who had to go through a lot of pain once exposed and get dragged down by one of our life's most dangerous addictions in life: Drugs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470847</url></doc>
