<plot>Four people form an unlikely alliance to sting a three-man credit-card scam operation. Behind the front of an electronic appliance store, Mr. Chiang and his bumbling nephew Wuchi, aided by a technical wizard called Blond Chiang, operate a high-tech credit-card scam. Sisi, one of their victims who works for the bank whose cards are being forged, joins forces with Do Do, a spirited collection officer for a finance company, with Wu, a good-looking petty thief who owes Do Do's company money, and with Lulu, Sisi's friend who lives in Wu's apartment. Wu pretends to work with Chiang, Lulu pretends to like Wuchi, Do Do dons peasant dress, and the trap is set.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662599</url></doc>
