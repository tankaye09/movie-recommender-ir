<plot>June is a young woman who loves her widowed father but cannot stand his constant interference in her life. In order to make peace with him, she goes as far as to break up with her younger and financially unstable boyfriend, in order for her father to find her a more suitable mate. Her father begins the search for potential mates at a local park, where other hopeful parents have set up a match-making market for their children. As her father regularly meets with other parents regarding their children's compatibility, she begins going on blind-dates. This is a story about an old-fashioned father and a modern daughter who, though they love each other deeply, cannot seem to stop hurting one another.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219578</url></doc>
