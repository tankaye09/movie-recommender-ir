<plot>The name 'Herod' will always be linked to Biblical history's most notorious atrocity: the slaughter of the new-borns after the birth of Christ. But is it true? There is no other historical or archaeological evidence that this event actually took place. So how did this legend enter history? Herod transformed himself from commoner to king. He was an outsider who infiltrated the royal court and fell in love. He outwitted his opponents and let nothing stand in his way. Was Herod in fact the man who saved the Holy Land from the Roman Empire? This is the untold story of Herod the Great.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585582</url></doc>
