<plot>A most elaborate procession, with an Oriental profusion of splendor and magnificence unthought of in America. This superb pageant, with its enormous and elaborately bedecked elephants, and its footmen in native East Indian costume, is here shown in all its splendor. There were over 200 elephants in the procession, and those shown in our picture stand out in stereoscopic relief from the far-reaching background. Each elephant carries a large howdah, which is decorated with the finest silks and satins, gold, jewels, ivory and silver; and must be seen to be appreciated. H. E. the Viceroy, and Lady Curzon, T. R. H., the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Gaekwar of Baroda, the Maharajahs of Myson and Travancore, and a number of gorgeously attired Indian Princes, glittering with jewels, are in the howdahs. The attendants are fanning the elephants as they pass the camera. An excellent piece of photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?639392</url></doc>
