<plot>Manu and Kanu are two con-men and petty thieves who work alone and are not known to one another. They individually decide to work for underground criminal Don "K.K.", and K.K. accepts them. This does not auger well with Bichoo, K.K.'s son, who dislikes them as he had physical disputes with them in the past. When both are assigned work, Bichoo makes an anonymous call to the police, and both are arrested, held in a cell, chained to each other. They are then transported to the Court, they escape, still chained to each other. It is then the underworld and the general community in India is shocked when photographs of both the escapees are flashed across television sets that they are responsible for killing a Police Inspector named Amar Sinha, and that the police have issued shoot-at-sight orders for both of them. The question remains, why would two small-time crooks take it upon themselves to kill a Police Officer?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153102</url></doc>
