<plot>Is all the toil with day-to-day work, where most of the money earned goes towards material items, which are not really necessary - worth it, when we all die in the end? For years we raped and pillaged the earth, without ever once giving back. This is changing, but will it be too late? We have been known to look down upon animals from our lofty perches, seeing them as lesser beings, and ourselves as super intelligent. But are they the ones who really have it right? "Are We" explores these sentiments in a dramatic light.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044939</url></doc>
