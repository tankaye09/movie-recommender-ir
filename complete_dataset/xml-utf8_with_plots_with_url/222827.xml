<plot>The Narrator, a reclusive and eccentric man, spends most of his time indoors and alone. Above him lives Greg, a loud, obnoxious man who recently broke his leg. When the Narrator offers to help Greg with his daily tasks, what begins as an occasional favor soon becomes much more. The Narrator must decide whether to submit to the demands of his overbearing neighbor, or for the first time in his life take a stand for himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222827</url></doc>
