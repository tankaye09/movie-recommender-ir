<plot>This is the first title to ever compile into one edition all the content ever-created related to the popular 1960's anime program, "Speed Racer." In addition to offering episode synopses and edited scenes from the original 52 films, the producers have also included content from the 1990's effort to re-launch the series, with animation from the studio that produced "The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." The producers also assisted Speed Racer Enterprises in the creation of a new Speed Racer program for the new century -- and the fully edited pilot is included as a bonus. Interviews, clips, interactive trivia and editorials abound, with a strong emphasis on all the product that has been manufactured over the years since the original show premiered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509827</url></doc>
