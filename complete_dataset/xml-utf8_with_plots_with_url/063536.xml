<plot>This film depicts a scene familiar not only during the recent Chinese Boxer uprising but at almost any time in China. The universal punishment for almost all offences, large and small, in China is the beheading of the culprits, and constant practice has made the executioner exceedingly expert in this gruesome work. Our picture shows a line of unfortunates on their knees awaiting the executioner's sword, and although it is somewhat horrible it shows truthfully the method of executing in this far-off country. In full view of the audience, and as the film progresses, the executioner is seen to approach each victim in turn and with one blow of his razor-like sword to sever the head from the body, which rolls into the basket prepared for its reception.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063536</url></doc>
