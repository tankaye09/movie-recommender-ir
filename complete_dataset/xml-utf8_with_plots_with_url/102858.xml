<plot>Junichi is a scout, recruiting girls for work in hostess bars. He's been at the job for seven years, but he's too softhearted to be a real success. Nanami, who is a music teacher at a junior high school, wishes that something would happen to change the course of her ordinary life. Junichi and Nanami have a disastrous first meeting. By the fourth time they bump into each other, Nanami begins to see Junichi as the man who just might save her from a mediocre life. Although it goes against everything that her upbringing has taught her, Nanami decides to give him a chance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102858</url></doc>
