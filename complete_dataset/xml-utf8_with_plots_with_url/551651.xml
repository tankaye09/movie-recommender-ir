<plot>"The Dance" is a feature documentary on the remarkable life of former champion prize fighter from the 1960's, Billy "The Kid" Roth, who has volunteered for 44 years to serve in the prisons of Louisiana as a boxing coach, and "father" to thousands of inmates. The Dance combines a visually stunning look inside the country's most dangerous prisons, along with original music from world class blues, gospel, and bluegrass musicians, and first hand accounts from inmates, former students and Billy himself - the man thousands of convicted felons call "Pops."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?551651</url></doc>
