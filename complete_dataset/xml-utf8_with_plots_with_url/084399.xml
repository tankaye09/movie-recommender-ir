<plot>Romulus and Remus are two CIA agents, their direct instructor is John Elliott. They both were picked up at an orphanage by Elliott at the age of about eight, raised together as brothers and specially trained to supersede every other agent in the service. This is what they know. What they do not know is that they are part of a system Elliott had invented to build up his own private army of pros which can be assigned to any job he wishes. One day Romulus takes over a job in the course of which he and his team blow up a house and about half a dozen civilians with it. After that Romulus feels he is being chased by both men of the CIA and the Mossad. He has to find out that Elliott betrayed both him and Remus from the start. Elliott used them and others, which were recruited and raised the same way Romulus and Remus were, to support a secret agreement that was constituted between top secret service leaders of England, France, Russia, Germany and the USA after the second world war. To its effect it says that no nation shall make greater progress in any field than all the others are. The conspirators intend to preserve the status quo in both economical and political aspects. As Romulus, now joined by Remus and a female Mossad- executive he was romantically involved with years ago, finds out about all of this he wants to take revenge on Elliott who in his opinion stole not only their lives, but also many more and destroyed thousands of others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084399</url></doc>
