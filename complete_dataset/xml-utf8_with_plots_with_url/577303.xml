<plot>When The Divorcee moved from the big city to New Philadelphia, Ohio, he had no clue what he was about to step into. After buying The Johnsand House, he learned the location was that of an uncanny double murder/suicide. He also found the former residents were not as dead as the local yokels believed, but were very interested in seeing him "cross over". It started by hearing giggles, whispers and dreams . Then the ghosts started to materialize, indicating there would be no chance of escape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577303</url></doc>
