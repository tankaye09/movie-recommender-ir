<plot>Timeless yet timely, 'Friendly Fire' presents a scene that may be playing out in many soldiers', and soldier's families' lives right now. Can love survive or does it become just another casualty of war? Louis is a practical woman. It's natural for a bride to make plans for her future, her family's future. Louis has made plans and the government orders are not part of them. She wants her husband to be there for the raising of their family - and she wants him whole. Jim is an honorable man and his first commitment is to his country. He believes everyone should follow the rules. Bravery, and sacrifice are just a part of life. The two conflicting directions push and pull in a last dance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204443</url></doc>
