<plot>It is not only a musical documentary about the singer Yildiz Ibrahimova, though music is everywhere to be found; jammed version of Gypsy songs, of Bulgarian and Turkish folksongs in the brilliant, profound, warm, grievous but optimistic interpretation by concert performer Yildiz. She gathers full houses both in Turkey and France, as well as in Bulgaria. Yildiz suffered the humiliation and anguish of the gross assimilation - her own and her family, and of the entire minority community she belongs to. The dramatic destiny of the Balkans is focused in her: violence against the minorities, two neighboring countries distrusting each other, the hard destiny of a gifted woman trying to make a career, and eventually - music bridging people and countries in the name of peace and love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261205</url></doc>
