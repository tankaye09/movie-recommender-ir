<plot>Shows a wild charge of Mounted Boer up a steep hill. The action of the picture is spirited and photographically it is an excellent film. The opening scene shows a bleak hillside with the Boer cavalry in the distance, galloping rapidly to the front. They cross the ridge just as the film ends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100082</url></doc>
