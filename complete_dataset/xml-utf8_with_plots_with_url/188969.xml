<plot>Enigmatic and intriguing, Hemingway is one of America's favorite authors. His dramatic understatement, dialogue and use of heroes made for great human interest. Hemingway's writing was influenced by his tenure as a foreign war correspondent; "A Farewell to Arms" and "To Have and Have Not" are excellent literary results of this experience. He is also known for "The Old Man and the Sea" which was derived from his time spent in Cuba. In 1954, Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, but stricken with physical maladies, he published nothing more of significance before his suicide in 1961.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188969</url></doc>
