<plot>Morning on the farm. A rooster rousts the chickens and geese. The chicks run out from under a huge hen, leaving her much smaller. She digs for a worm by turning her bill into a brace and bit, then divides the worm among the kids by running it through a meat grinder. One of the chicks has a fight with one of the resulting worms. An expectant father rooster fetches doctor stork, who comes out with a basket full of white chicks and one little black one, who gets crowded out of the food. Seeing a fenced in garden, he sings the title song. Finding a discarded girdle, he uses it as wings, and a pair of bloomers as a parachute. Feast time! That is, until the scarecrow comes after him, but he's quickly dispatched.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253432</url></doc>
