<plot>An ugly looking burglar approaches a house, and after trying the door and finding it locked, gains admission by prying open a window. A passing policeman, upon seeing the window open, pokes his head through to see if any one is in. The burglar forces the window down on the cop when he attempts to climb in, and escapes through the top of it, giving the cop a good squeezing between the window and frame. The householder, hearing the noise, rushes out of the house in his night clothes just as the policeman frees himself, and is grabbed and handled very roughly by the "cop," who discovers his mistake after giving the man a good shaking. Very humorous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086966</url></doc>
