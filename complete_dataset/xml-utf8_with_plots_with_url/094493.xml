<plot>This is undoubtedly one of the best moving pictures of trained animals. The different breeds of dogs each have their own specialty. There is bareback riding, seesaw, jumping through the hoop, walking on their front paws only and concluding with the greyhounds jumping over obstacles the highest of which is about 20 feet. Very fine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?094493</url></doc>
