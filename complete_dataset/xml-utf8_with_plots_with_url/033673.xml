<plot>Across the city, the legend of a man sets women on fire. They say that his eyes can demolish the strongest woman; that his words are celestial music; that he is a master at exploring the feminine body. Some have even compared him to the mythical character Don Juan. He is Simon Luna, the most famous tourist guide in the Caribbean, specialized in taking vacationers to Venezuela's most exotic locations. Another detail makes this legend even more disturbing: the best lover in town has never been conquered by any woman. That is^Å until the arrival of Camila Rigores. A woman of incredible beauty and overpowering personality, she's the daughter of Leon Rigores, owner of the biggest hotel in the capital. Camila Rigores returns to Venezuela with the mission of managing her father's hotel and of reactivating the tourist industry across the country. But an unforeseeable tragedy occurs: Isabel Rigores, Camila's younger sister, commits suicide because of an unrequited love. Camila decides to get revenge for her sister's unexpected suicide and hunts down the man responsible for her death. That man is none other than Simon Luna. Camila Rigores works out a master plan. The great womanizer must be attracted with tasty bait, and what better bait than herself? Simon will be surprised by the sudden apparition of Camila Rigores in one of the most impressive locations of Venezuelan nature. She will make him her business partner, will challenge him to seduce her and will propose the rarest of bets. It is then that her duel to death with him begins. Simon, never suspecting that she is Isabel's sister, and totally ignorant of Isabel's death, is immediately captivated by Camila's beauty. He accepts the challenge of seducing her in a limited time period, and they each bet all of their assets, meaning complete ruin for the one who loses. The proposition is totally crazy, but it is a challenge that Simon simply cannot refuse. Starting the next day, Simon Luna will try to seduce the world's most difficult woman, while she sets her lethal trap. And this dangerous game will violently change their lives forever. But our story not only focuses on this memorable duel, as the El Dorado hotel harbors more love affairs than the city has ever known. The lives of both the hotel guests and employees will generate a kaleidoscope of tales: Powerful men, emancipated women, couples on the verge of separation, desperate singles, friends betraying friends, secret loves, blundering casanovas, heartless grandmothers and exuberant granddaughters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033673</url></doc>
