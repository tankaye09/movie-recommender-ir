<plot>It was Claude Monet's impression "soleil levant" which gave the impressionist school it's name. Famed for seeing the subtle nuances of color, light and atmosphere in landscape, Monet's great works include "Haystacks" and "Water Lillies". This program features footage from L'Orangerie and from Monet's house and gardens at Giverny plus special film shot at London's Savoy Hotel, from where Monet painted his famous views of London.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566149</url></doc>
