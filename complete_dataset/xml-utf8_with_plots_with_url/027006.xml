<plot>AIR GROUP 16: WE CAME TO REMEMBER This documentary tells the story of the last reunion of Air Group 16 - the pilots, radiomen and gunners who served on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Lexington in the Pacific in World War II. The film follows the veterans and their families as they make the journey by train, plane and car to Washington, DC, for their final reunion at the dedication of the National World War II Memorial in May 2004. Through stunning archival footage, period music and dramatic first-person accounts, the film follows Air Group 16 as they tell their stories, remember their fallen comrades and accept official honors from the country they served.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027006</url></doc>
