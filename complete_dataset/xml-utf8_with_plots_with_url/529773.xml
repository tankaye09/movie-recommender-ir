<plot>This show was a military talent show sponsored by the US Army to aid recruiting. The show, emceed by Steve Allen, featured amateurs trying to win a night on the town with a pretty actress. In April 1953, Allen was replaced by Bud Collyer who was replaced by Arlene Francis in June 1953. In 1954, professional entertainers in the Army were featured each week instead of the amateurs of the first year. In June 1955, the show expanded to 60 minutes from 30 and Richard Hayes, who was in the Army, joined Ms. Francis as co-host. All of the music on the show was provided by Army bands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529773</url></doc>
