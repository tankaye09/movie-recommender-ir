<plot>This is the story of a journey made by a young religious family: Yael, Yoni, and their three-year-old son Yiftach. Yoni, once a barely observant Jew, is now devoted to the passionately Hassidic Breslov tradition. His wife Yael has remained in a more moderate, mainstream branch of Judaism. Yiftach's third birthday falls on the holiday of Lag Ba'omer, and Yoni wants to take Yiftach through a masculine rite of passage -the halakeh ceremony, where a boy's hair is cut for the first time, leaving only his ear-locks. The long journey to Mount Meron brings their conflict into sharp relief. Their encounters with various characters along the way further highlight the chasm which has developed between them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227494</url></doc>
