<plot>Mr. Newlywed will not allow his wife to have a dog. Her uncle, taking pity on her, goes out to buy one. Meanwhile, Wilkens and his wife, butler and maid to the Newlyweds are informed they must retrieve their "secret" child from friends who were watching her. Uncle comes home with the dog, a cute puppy, and shows his niece. He hides it in the sideboard. Mr. Newlywed shows the uncle an article in the paper about a mad dog running wild in Passaic (Solax Film Co. was located in Ft. Lee, NJ). Quickly, Uncle sneaks the puppy out in his coat. The Wilkens' bring their baby in and hide him/her in the same sideboard! Mrs. Newlywed feels guilty and writes Mr. a note telling him to look in the sideboard and not to be to angry for she will never deceive him again. He looks and, seeing the baby, screams, bring everyone into the room, including Uncle with the puppy. Soon, all is straightened out and all ends happily.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?373405</url></doc>
