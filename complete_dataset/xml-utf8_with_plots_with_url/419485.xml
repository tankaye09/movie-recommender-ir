<plot>Wanda (Sellecca) is a con-woman whom the NYPD arrested and convinced to help them nail a criminal. What she didn't expect was that she would have to testify at his trial, and even more was that his trial wouldn't take place for a few more years. So, they send her to Palm Springs, where she would be placed in the employ of a Security Agency, PSI, Palm Security Inc. Accompanying and protecting and watching her to make sure she doesn't runaway is Joey (Evigan), a New York cop. They pretend to be a married couple Cody and Dani Powell. Upon arriving Dani suspects that one of the town's leading citizens kidnapped or killed a girl who's having an affair with her husband and at the same time is searching for a multi-million dollar winning lottery ticket.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419485</url></doc>
