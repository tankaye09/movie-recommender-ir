<plot>In a post-apocalyptic future, a comet carrying a deadly virus strikes Earth, killing millions and mutating others. Survivors of the plague are forced to live by the rule of the Order, a religious dictatorship that listens to the voice of the Oracle. Civilians who do not follow the Order's rule face imprisonment and/or death. In the light of this, the Front is formed to get rid of the Order's evil rule. Stealing the Order's weapons and training soldiers like you, the Front is destined to restore peace and freedom on Earth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518430</url></doc>
