<plot>You remember, probably, your efforts in this line when you were a boy. Oh, what a struggle it was then; but imagine a man fifty years old learning to skate on roller skates, simply because a young lady he is smitten with requests it. You know, old love is foolish, so our friend tried, and we trust his love will not meet with so many hard, hard falls; funny is no name for this.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112036</url></doc>
