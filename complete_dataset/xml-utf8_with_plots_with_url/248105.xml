<plot>After a wealthy businessman, Huntley Gordon, returns from a "hard day's work", his wife, Vivian Oakland, knows that he is fibbing because she was at the clubhouse watching her husband when he was playing golf. Vivian seemed to pay more attention to the lesson that Huntley received from Jones. At home,just as he is about to become an emotional wreck, she eventually straightens out Huntley's golf swing woes by reviewing the pointers that Jones gave him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248105</url></doc>
