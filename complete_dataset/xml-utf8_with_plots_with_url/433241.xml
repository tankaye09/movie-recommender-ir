<plot>Businessman Sonu Sharma belongs to a wealthy family and lives with his widowed mother. He suddenly becomes ill, is hospitalized and looked after by a young nurse, Heena, who he falls in love with. After he gets discharged both of them get married in a secret temple ceremony. Thereafter, he asks Heena to resign from her job, re-locate to a small town where he has rented a house called "Madhu Villa", and he will join her soon. Upon arrival at Madhu Villa, Heena is met by Sonu's brother, Laalu, and their paternal uncle. Days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months and still Sonu has not arrived. Quite unknown to Heena, Sonu has no brothers nor even any uncles. The two masquerading are actually two escaped convicts, one of who is awaiting the death sentence, and there no guarantee that Sonu may ever return to live with her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433241</url></doc>
