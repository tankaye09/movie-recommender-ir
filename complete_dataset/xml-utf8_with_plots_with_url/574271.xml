<plot>The Making of Major Hana is a behind the scenes documentary about the making of an independent feature film called, Major Hana. The film chronicles a journey an American recording engineer/producer, Chris Weld, makes from Hawaii to London, to work, and see his girlfriend. It's quite an emotional ride and late at night, aboard an old, Red, Routemaster bus in London, he meets several characters who are about to change his life forever. The Making of Major Hana provides interviews with both cast and crew that prove to be poignant and funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574271</url></doc>
