<plot>This is a good one. A man and wife return from a ball and before retiring they indulge in a quarrel and hubby leaves the house in high dudgeon. Wifey now regrets the part she took and calling her maid takes her into her confidence and the two women confer. The maid suggests that she should don a full suit of men's wearing apparel and then make love to the wife when the husband comes home. They carry out their ideas and when the master comes home he is shocked to see his wife in the arms of an apparently handsome young man. He prepares to give the visitor a drubbing, when the maid who is dressed as a man removes the mustache and allows her hair to fall, much to the surprise of hubby and delight of wifey. They are thus reconciled and we draw the curtain here.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025255</url></doc>
