<plot>Texas Rangers Captain Wally(Wally Wales)is leading a troop of Rangers in pursuit of the Valdez brothers, border bandits. There is an encounter with a portion of the outlaw band in which Jose Valdez(Jack Phipps) is killed by Wally. The Rangers head for the Flores ranch where Carlos(Walter Miller) and Manuel Valdez(Franklyn Farnum)are hiding out.Before they get there Carlos and Manuel hear of Jose's death and ride out for vengeance. Rosita Flores(Virginia Brown Faire), Jose's sweetheart and daughter of ranch owner Don Flores(Lafe McKee), also thirsts for vengeance and demands that the Ranger Captain be brought back to her alive.For his part, old man Flores has had more than enough of the Valdez brothers.The Rangers are trapped in Hell's Valley, Wally is severely wounded and his force scattered.He is brought back to the ranch where Rosita promises the Valdez brothers to nurse him back to life so that he can be tortured. Oh, yeah, that the teekit.But the Valdez brothers have no contigency plan in the event Rosita falls in love with her patient, especially with both brothers now having an eye on Rosita since Jose is out of the picture.But after some fighting, shooting, riding, intrigue and a smooch or two between Wally and Rosita, Carlos is tricked into shooting Manuel and is, in turn, killed by Rosita's father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?234919</url></doc>
