<plot>An elderly man, Leonard, finds the driver's side door of his van blocked in the parking lot. As he tries to climb in from the passenger side, he slips and falls violently between the seats. Trapped and injured, he spots one of his grandchildren's toys beneath the seat: a cowboy. As he drifts into a sleep he remembers of how he had always longed to be a cowboy, and dreams of his idyllic and heroic death: as a hero saving a damsel in distress from a dangerous outlaw, in the Wild West.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569840</url></doc>
