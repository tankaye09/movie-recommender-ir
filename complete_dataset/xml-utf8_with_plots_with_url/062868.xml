<plot>Everyday he sees them, the dog chained to the tree and the bird caged and hanging on the barn door. Everyday he takes them away. Upon his return, however, the animals are there to greet him, the dog chained back to the tree; the bird on the barn door. Every day -- a man haunted by two animals and a tree painter trying to keep him from total detachment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062868</url></doc>
