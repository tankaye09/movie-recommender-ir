<plot>This is a very effective scene. The opening shows Jesus as He hangs on the cross in death. Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Mary Magdalene are discovered weeping at the foot of the cross. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, who have obtained permission to inter the remains, are seen to enter and take down the body of Jesus and carefully wrap it in a white sheet for burial. The rough crown of thorns is taken from the head and the two women kneel and weep as the cortege prepares to depart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425391</url></doc>
