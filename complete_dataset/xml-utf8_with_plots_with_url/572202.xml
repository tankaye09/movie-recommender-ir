<plot>Ray Priest leaves his wife, Maria, after they row at a family wedding. As he drives into the night he picks up a young hitch-hiker. The hitch-hiker is a mysterious character, sometimes menacing, sometimes acting as confidant, allowing Ray to explore his relationship with his family. When the car runs out of petrol they must walk to a nearby garage. Ray's vulnerability becomes evident as they walk through a forest in the dark.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572202</url></doc>
