<plot>The History of Computer Animation Volume 1 takes you on a delirious trip through a strange and magical world where anything can be created - from chrome dinosaurs to a melancholy nightclub piano player. From the very first uses of computers to create motion and make art - to the futuristic wizardry of motion picture special effects, this award winning one-hour documentary explores the furthest reaches of computer animation using the hypnotic works of over 150 production companies and artists from around the world! See how computer animation sequences are built up step-by-step, from the construction of wire frame models to the addition of color, lighting and texture. Dozens of spectacular, state-of-the-art examples show the effective use of computer graphics in such diverse fields as advertising, production, business communication , architectural and product design, education, medicine, scientific research, real time simulation, children's games and dramatic production.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241530</url></doc>
