<plot>15 year old Jarrett Holden has spent the last three years living in two different homes: one with his conservative, pastor father and the other with his pessimistic, free-willed mother. When word arises that Jarrett's father is getting remarried, Jarrett decides he wants to live permanently with his mother, who just so happens to have fled town without telling him. This look into average adolescence portrays the difficulties of youth and family, while finding one's place between it all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021454</url></doc>
