<plot>A group of disconnected people are all being brought together by a string of awkward events in post-tragedy Manhattan... A body-snatcher is snatching up bodies off the streets of the city and no one seems to know exactly what she is doing with them, especially the two cops assigned to find her. Across town a depressed Broadway actress has a reunion with her old friend and there is some awkward tension about the distance that is now between them. Angela's boyfriend, a neurotic, self-proclaimed 'suicidal' filmmaker, captures the women's reunion for his 'new movie.' Meanwhile, to lift up his own spirits, Kevin seeks out the counsel of his paranoid best friend to try to find advice about life... Soundtracked by a medley of music from the band Sonic Youth, PEOPLE ARE DEAD is a slice out of contemporary New York life. But not the high-brow kind that is seen so often... this is about the people in the background, the alleys, and the subways who just feel stuck.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?428414</url></doc>
