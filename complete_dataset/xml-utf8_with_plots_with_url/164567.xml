<plot>"Nasty" Nick Cotton has been in prison since his last appearance in Walford in 1998 and is now out and all set to return to Walford yet again. He suddenly has a dream where he can see the ghost of his father Charlie. As he wakes up in a Squat he decides to meet up with his son Ashley and ex-wife Zoe Cotton.
