<plot>Udd and Yai are a gay couple who leave the big city, and move to a remote town where the scenery matches their favorite gay western movie "Brokeback Mountain". There, they buy an abandoned gas station so they can settle down. Sadly, Udd later finds out that Yai secretly and passionately has an affair with a local girl. When his pure love turns to jealousy, Udd plans to use the gas station to murder Yai. But, no one really knows that the gas station is already haunted, and the ghosts there have plans of their own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218367</url></doc>
