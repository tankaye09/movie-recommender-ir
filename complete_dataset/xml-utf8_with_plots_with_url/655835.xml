<plot>Papa has been to the club. He returns and finds wifey asleep (or apparently asleep). He thinks he will play Foxy Quiller, and standing upon a chair, sets the clock back several hours, but wifey discovers him and makes a terrible row. Papa in a dazed condition goes to the sideboard, seizes a bottle of seltzer water and plays it on his better half with the evident purpose of cooling her off, but papa gets very much the worst of it in the battle that follows.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655835</url></doc>
