<plot>Karloff and Me, will explore the parallel between Boris Karloff, the first man to don the Frankenstein suit, and Ron MacCloskey, the largest collector in the world of vintage Karloff and Frankenstein memorabilia. Through interviews with legends of Hollywood and television, we will learn about all the different phases of Karloff's career (movies, T.V. and Broadway) and all of the different phases of MacCloskey's life, and how he got to know the man in the Frankenstein suit through all of his different projects. There is a strange parallel between these two men as MacCloskey began filming this project - a lifelong ambition - at the same age that Karloff began filming the original Frankenstein, his breakout role.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287206</url></doc>
