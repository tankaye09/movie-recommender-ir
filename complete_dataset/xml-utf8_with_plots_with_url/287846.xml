<plot>Kate Clinton embarks on a 50-city "It's Come to This!" tour, sponsored by the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Her hilarious performances are interspersed with a variety of personal moments, including behind-the-scenes interviews, and special appearances by Lily Tomlin, Melissa Etheridge, Billie Jean King and other lesbian celebrities and comics. For a woman who has successfully changed people's lives and minds through her smart style of lesbian humor, this comedy special is a tribute well earned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287846</url></doc>
