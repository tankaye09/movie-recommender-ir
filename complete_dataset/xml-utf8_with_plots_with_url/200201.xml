<plot>Jeremiah is an emotionally disturbed high school student having difficulties adjusting in school. His peers don't understand him so they ridicule him, and his teachers and authority figures can't get through to him so they dismiss him. Jeremiah has reached his boiling point, he wants to show them what it's like to suffer, but suffering is only the beginning. * 'The Wages of Sin' is a dark and disturbing look at school violence from an unlikely perspective.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200201</url></doc>
