<plot>Part early 20th century old-timey documentary, part epic adventure, this short film combines many influences to pose the question: what is the nature of man? The film follows the lives of three ancient men who live in an environment free of the influences of government and modern society, behaving in whatever manner they see fit. Though in the beginning their lives are pleasant and leisurely, their world is shaken when something is introduced into it that they all desperately want, but cannot all possess. What will be the outcome of this sudden change? Will man show himself to be good, capable of doing what is right? Or is all-out war an inevitable part of man's existence?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602211</url></doc>
