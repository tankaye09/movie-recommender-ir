<plot>Colleen Rose joins a pastorate in an Anglican Church where she is left to sink because of a lack of introductions. The leader, Tara King, and her close friends, Gemma and Anna Arbuthnott, are the threshold guardians of the pastorate who control the source of power that will liberate and mobilize Colleen in her Christian walk. Their style of speech and social codes of conduct distances her from them. The story unfolds in a heightened state of naturalism, demonstrating the huge gulf in personality between them. The pastorate is an environment where Christians can grow and mature in fellowship and bible study, but the members take the opportunity to resist Colleen from developing socially and spiritually in the group. Instead of retaliating, Colleen absorbs their hostile energy and then bides her time until an opportunity presents itself for her to deliver a killer blow to them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581636</url></doc>
