<plot>In New York in the 1920s and 30s Juanita Boisseau danced at the legendary night club The Cotton Club. Today Juanita is 89 years old, and she still lives in her apartment in Harlem, few streets from the corner where The Cotton Club once was the center of the best intertainment in Amerika. Juanita worked with world known Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, while her own life was not so glamourous. Juanita's small rooms are filled with memories, moods and stories from a life with inviting dance which she still perfoms. The vodka-drinking Juanita still has beautiful legs and when the music plays, noone can hold her back. The film draws the portrait of a person, who should have been an abortion. Juanita aimed for wealth and fame - and has carried life with a thought-provoking strenght and pride.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?116467</url></doc>
