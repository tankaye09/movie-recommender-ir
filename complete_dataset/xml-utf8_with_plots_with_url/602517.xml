<plot>A lone woman sets out to become a writer. Beset by self doubts made poignant by her neighbor's incessant typing, his sudden silence draws her in to find fate has written an important role for her. Is she The Writer? The production of The Writer was conceived as an experiment in the auteur theory of film to test whether a solitary, creative vision truly can drive an entire project. All of the pre-production, production and post-production tasks aside from the acting were performed by one person. The experiment provided many revelations about just how much any creative endeavor thrives on the collaborative process. Whether the experiment has succeeded is left to the judgment of the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602517</url></doc>
