<plot>Comfortable Skin is at once a psychological drama and an erotic thriller -- a mysterious rumination on love, loss, sacrifice, and transformation of identity. Nathalie is a French voice-over actress living in Paris with an intense, curious fascination for other women's bodies. Justine, an English woman who makes her living as an escort and prostitute, must leave London in order to escape a brutal, abusive fate. Alex, a failed, young American writer, is torn apart by his inability to save a loved one. In Paris, an unintended murder leads to an enigmatic and emotional bond between the two women, and a bond that will ultimately include Alex's own destiny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111946</url></doc>
