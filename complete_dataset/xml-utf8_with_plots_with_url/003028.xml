<plot>This dark documentary can be seen as three separate stories of people united by two themes: they were born in 1973 in Mexico City, and their lives were, to different extent, destroyed. The first story is that of Rodolfo Escogido, a student leader who raises to obtain significant power in an organization known for being corrupt and violent. Rodolfo is able to unite its splinter groups, and enjoys a brief moment of glory, but later can't to keep them together. He has a falling out with the governmental authorities who, at one point, had supported him, and ends up in jail accused, falsely according to him, of robbery. For the documentary he is interviewed in prison. The second story is that of María Fernanda Ramos Macín (Mafer), an emotionally unstable girl whose life begins to disintegrate in a mixture of partying, alcohol, drugs and unwanted pregnancies, until she attempts suicide by jumping from an 11-meter tall bridge, which leaves her paraplegic. The last story is that of Alejandro Cota, a psychopath serving a 50-year jail sentence for murdering his mother and three siblings in 1992. Also interviewed in jail, he recreates the grisly murder scene, committed with three accomplices using knives and a pipe wrench, and incredibly tries to portray himself as the victim.</plot><plot>This dark documentary can be seen as three separate stories of people united by two themes: they were born in 1973 in Mexico City, and their lives were, to different extent, destroyed.
