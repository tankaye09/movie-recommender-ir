<plot>John Blake used to be a poet and actor; now he is an accountant . Locked into a routine of work and drinking, he listens glumly to tapes of his performances and cynically reflects that it was 'all bullshit'. His wife Maggie attempts to reconnect him with the joyful spirit that brought them together; his drinking buddy Jim, challenges him to pick up the shards of his fractured artistic vision. Director Michael Poitevin infuses his film with words of Shakespeare ('As You Like It') and the atmosphere of bars, allowing his story to explore the conflict between conformity and creativity, between despair and clarity and between those who dare and those too scared to dream, in this ultimately uplifting portrait of an artist's rebirth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185323</url></doc>
