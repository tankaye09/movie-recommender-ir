<plot>In the seedy underworld of 1920s Buenos Aires, Tango legend Carlos Gardel is involved in a torrid love affair with a prostitute and sees his life shattered when a bullet takes her life and pierces his own flesh. Remaining in his lung for the rest of his life, the bullet serves as an eternal reminder of his pain and loss. Finding his way to the exciting Paris of the 1930s, Carlos seduces the crowds with his enchanting voice, bringing Tango music as a liberating force to Europe. Amidst this backdrop of free-spirited decadence and corruption, a mysterious woman enters his life and changes him forever, turning his beautiful sorrow into a musical legend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126962</url></doc>
