<plot>Fleeting memories float about: a college-age girl, Kim, outside, smiling playing on the grass...... these memories fade away and: Andrea has returned to Harvard University after being away for an unknown reason. She tries to call someone from her dorm room, but gives up out of either fear or depression. She decides to visit this someone, Kim, in a room one floor down from her own. Kim is unpleasantly surprised to see Andrea, and Andrea cannot deal with standing in awkward silence with Kim. How do they know each other? What is their relationship? Andrea uses Kim's bathroom to ameliorate the awkward situation. While Andrea is inside, Kim goes to her drawer and takes out a plastic bag of unknown substance. She places the bag in Andrea's purse that she angrily dropped on the floor before she went into the bathroom. After composing herself, Andrea comes out of the bathroom, takes her bag, and leaves. Andrea goes back to her dorm room, angry with herself and the world, only to find the bag of unknown substance in her purse- And suddenly WE are flung into another scene where she, with Kim at her dorm table, is snorting the substance, now identified as cocaine. This scene is either a familiar situation or a memory, at once fond and terrifying. Kim watches Andrea degrade herself, an air of accomplishment about her, then takes Andrea's hand and leads her out of the dorm room into a fragment of a lovely memory: the two of them holding hands, outside, Kim's hair bobbing up and down, Kim beaming at Andrea.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?122364</url></doc>
