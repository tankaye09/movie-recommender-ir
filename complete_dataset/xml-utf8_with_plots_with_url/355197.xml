<plot>Kamli belongs to a poor family. She sells datuns for a living. She sells them in local suburban trains as well as on railway platforms. One day she meets a bachelor named Pratap, who would like her to become a lady, and be educated, to which she agrees. She thinks that Pratap is in love with her, little does she know that she is the subject of a bet between Pratap and his friend, Kashinath, who both find her crude, crass, loud, and uncouth, so much so that both doubt that she can be transformed into a lady.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355197</url></doc>
