<plot>In 1957, Ron Manolio and his suburban Cleveland family saved a year's worth of eggshells, painted them, and placed them on their lawn for Easter morning passersby to enjoy. The attention generated by that not-so-simple act would change the lives of a family, a community, and thousands of strangers. "Eggshelland" is the story of Ron and Betty Manolio, and their unique 52-year family tradition - an inspiring, colorful, quirky and poignant display of art and obsession. Transforming their front yard into a childlike dreamworld of color, fantasy and creativity, the Manolios have brought joy to generations of Midwesterners waking from a long, gray winter. But "Eggshelland" is more than a suburban lawn display. It's a beautiful, funny, strange and emotional story of the many lives that have been touched, the never-ending joy of childhood in the Spring, and the resounding contentment of a life well lived.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166326</url></doc>
