<plot>Two blacksmiths are at work, facing the camera, a wall, window, and stacked boxes behind them. Both are mustachioed with dark hair. On our right, a smith in the dark clothes of a laborer continuously turns the handle of the bellows, keeping hot a small furnace in front of him. On our left, in white shirt and tie, the lead smith pounds a three-foot length of metal on an anvil and then plunges the shaft into a tub of water at his feet. He takes a metal rod and scrapes it across the shaft. Next, from our left, a man enters with refreshments. Work pauses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?331056</url></doc>
