<plot>The Pink Panther arrives on a small tropical island, but the little pointy-nosed man and his dog are also there hunting for food. When the panther hears rifle shots, he fears he is going to be prey for hunters. He decides to keep himself hidden from sight, and starts playing pranks for the man and the dog, hoping to make the man hate his pet. After the panther makes the dog set fire on the man's gun powder while he loads his rifle, resulting in two explosions, the dog is banned from the man's sight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433330</url></doc>
