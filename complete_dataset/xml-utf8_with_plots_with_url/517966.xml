<plot>Interior of a crowded street car. Young lady enters and every man in the car offers her his seat. Presently an elderly stout lady with arm full of bundles enters. All male passengers immediately bury their faces in their papers, while the lady swings on the strap. A sudden jerk of the car lands her in the lap of a dude, much to the amusement of the other passengers. She pulls herself together, only to be thrown sprawling on the dude again. This time she smashes his high hat. The dude leaves the car, and the old lady gathers up her bundles and sits down with a satisfied smile.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517966</url></doc>
