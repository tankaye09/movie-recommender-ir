<plot>Dad drives down the highway with the Angry Kid sitting in the middle of the back seat. The Kid runs through a list of naughty words asking his father if it's okay to say them. After a series of angry "no!" responses, the Kid finally hits upon a word that dad says is okay to say. So the Kid says it so often that dad loses his temper and it's downhill from there, with dad supplying his own expletive punctuated by a rolled up newspaper. Pity the Kid.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?524754</url></doc>
