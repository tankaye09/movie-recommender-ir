<plot>Royston Vasey, a.k.a. Roy 'Chubby' Brown, is Britain's rudest comedian, infamous for his outrageously racist, sexist and homophobic gags. It's an accolade that's meant he's never been allowed to perform on TV. But this has turned out to be more of a blessing than a curse as he's done very well for himself off the back of his army of fans buying his videos, DVDs, audio cassettes and show tickets. But how different is Roy Vasey from his stage persona 'Chubby' Brown? Film maker Will Yapp follows him around for a few months in 2005 and attempts to find out, following Roy as he goes on tour, re-visits his home town of Middlesborough, shares his family life and prepares for his first appearance on TV in 18 years on The Frank Skinner Show. Are the bigoted, offensive jokes he tells on stage just his act or personal views with a nastier edge to them?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469456</url></doc>
