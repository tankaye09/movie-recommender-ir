<plot>Based on the short story Blue World by Robert McCammon. In a dark city filled with passion, death and crime, a serial killer known as The Stranger, is hunting and killing the cast of an extremely popular porn film. Father John Lancaster, the ideal Priest, has been the epitome of morality his entire life, but when Debbie Stoner, The Porn Star, steps into his confessional a new kind of faith courses through his veins. Fate mixed with desire pushes the unlikely pair together with Father Lancaster saving Debbie from certain death. This small and completely unselfish act plunges our Priest into a life that is in deep contrast to his own. As Debbie and Father Lancaster's relationship grows closer, The Stranger moves in for his final kill. Pulled between the Church and someone in need, our Priest gets caught in the struggle not to let himself be lead into temptation while delivering them all from evil.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076621</url></doc>
