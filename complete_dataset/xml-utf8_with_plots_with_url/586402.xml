The customer, Lana, a pretty local businesswoman, is friendly to the man, much to the dismay of meddling restaurant manager, Sylvia. But Jo Ann, the soft spoken waitress, provides a constant balance to the aggressive Sylvia. Lana finds comfort in Marvin's words as she struggles to find her own identity in life. But Sylvia is determined to undermine the relationship. During one of his breaks from work, Marvin shares thoughts from his past with Lana.
