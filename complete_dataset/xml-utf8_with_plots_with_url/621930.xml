<plot>Billy finds an ax has been left at his front door only days after an unsolved ax murder outside of town. Is the abandoned ax related to the murder? Who left it? Why Billy? Alarmed Billy summons his two friends, Monty and Miranda to his house in order to decide what to do. Much to Billy's dismay Monty and Miranda prove to be anything but helpful, playing practical jokes and spinning the facts in order to get a rise out of Billy. Eventually Billy finds himself on the defensive trying to prove to Monty and Miranda that he is not the murder. Sick of being the butt of all the jokes Billy allies with Monty to play a few Mind games of his own. Through the course of this last practical joke the true origin of the ax is revealed and it is far less sinister than any of them could have guessed. However by now the final prank has run it's course and Miranda's reaction to it takes them both by surprise</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621930</url></doc>
