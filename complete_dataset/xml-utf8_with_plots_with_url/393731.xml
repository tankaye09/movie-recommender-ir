<plot>Never Mind the Fences explores a unique community in the blue-collar city of Wichita, Kansas. Here, in the nation's airplane production capital, musicians such as Dan Davis have circumvented the corporate music industry and created a DIY music scene on their own terms. Since the recent explosion of the "all-ages" music scene five years ago, Wichita has become a Mecca of underground music, but still remains almost entirely unnoticed by the industry. Rather than succumb the corporatist churn-it-out mentality, Dan and a handful of local artists have created a buzz by producing a three-day music festival, attracting music-lovers and creators from across the country. In a place where making it means being happy with what you have and what you are doing, MTV and big record labels are the antithesis of what these musicians strive for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393731</url></doc>
