<plot>3D animated holiday cartoon starring Santa, his crew of Reindeer, and introducing four new actors: The Camels! Caught in a raging sandstorm on Christmas Eve, Santa must find a way to bring presents to children of the Middle East. With the help of Camels Akhmed, Moshe, Yosh and Amir, Santa delivers. One of four stories in a series of short films called SANTA'S WORLD TRAVELS. Short, sweet, and entertaining, each segment provides a valuable lesson of cross cultural cooperation for young and old. These non-religious holiday tales are of people sharing a common goal and respect their fellow man. At a time when many children are being taught to fear the Middle East, it teaches tolerance and respect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?477173</url></doc>
