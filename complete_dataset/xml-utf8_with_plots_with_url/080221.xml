<plot>Steve Hazard and Jim Ward, U. S. Cavalry sergeants Are constantly battling over girls, horses or anything that came up that had more than one side to it. On the day before their enlistment is up, a stagecoach is held up and robbed of the mine payroll. Among the passengers are Norman Brett, Dale Starr and Blain Cornwall. Miss Star has inherited the Emporium gambling palace from an uncle; Brett is a prominent mine owner, and Cornwall ostensibly is an assayer, but is, in reality a Treasury Department agent. Later, Jim, Steve and their pal "Chatter" get into trouble, Steve talks Jim in re-enlisting, but fails to do so himself, as does "Chatter." Jim is not a happy trooper at this turn of events. Cornwall enlists Steve to help him in his investigation and has Steve hold up a stagecoach, to enable him to join the bandit gang, which is headed by Brett, and abetted by Sam Ridgeway, who runs the Emporium for Dale. Jim, not knowing the reason for Steve's activities, trails him and he and Sergeant Dunne arrest Steve and "Chatter" and return them to Fort Rocky for jailing. This puts a crimp into Steve's plan to stop the holdup of the Army pay wagon by Brett and Ridgeway's gang.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080221</url></doc>
