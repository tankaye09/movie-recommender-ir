<plot>After a year in prison, Venkat Krishnan finally sits on the other side of the prison-wall. Next to him is a young Indian, Big Nasty. This thug with a baby face breaks the news to Venkat that to the world they'll never be anything but criminals with nothing and nobody. Venkat responds, "I've got family." But at his Hindu home his wife, Indira, is avoiding him; His daughter, Gita is engaged to Marco, an actor who shares the stage with her, but a man Venkat has never meet; His son, Basky, is stealing cars. And the Indian community has no place for the Krishnan family. Venkat's homecoming becomes a quarrel of pint up emotions. This is not the homecoming that Venkat expected. Venkat decides that to save his family, he must confront his former cell-mate to save his son, and live with his family in the now, not in a life molded by traditions and the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280081</url></doc>
