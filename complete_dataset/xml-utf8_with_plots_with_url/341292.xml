<plot>The film starts with a man's meetings with a girl, who we come to know are lovers. We discover that the man has some complexes and is very concerned about how he is perceived. Some time he is also offensive to the girl. In a sudden shift we see him disfigure, sadly rebelling against himself. What is real? and what is within his head? who is the girl? and what is his relationship with her? are the questions that are answered finally.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341292</url></doc>
