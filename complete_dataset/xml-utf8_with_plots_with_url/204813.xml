<plot>In 1979, the Islamic Revolution in Iran brought a twenty-five-hundred-year history to a close for the Jews who left their homeland for America. Uncertain about their safety and fearing religious persecution in Khomeini's Islamic Theocracy, an estimated 80,000 of Iran's 100,000 Jews fled the country. This documentary tells the story of those Jews who reestablished a tight-knit community in Los Angeles. Iranian Jewish families and young adults take us through the details of their lives in the United States. The families retell how and why they left Iran, their struggles as Jews while in Iran, how they escaped by land across the Iranian border and how they have tenaciously tried to hold on to their heritage in the United States. We experience the difficulties young adults face being raised in traditional Iranian Jewish homes in America today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204813</url></doc>
