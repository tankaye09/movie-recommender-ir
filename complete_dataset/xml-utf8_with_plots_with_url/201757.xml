<plot>In early August, prior to the beginning of the college football season, Movietone News would put together a collection of footage used in their newsreels during the past season and have an instant review of the past, leading into the future. They'd do the same at the end of the season. In the days before television and the 24/7 advent of ESPN, unless a fan was at the game, football fans only got a glimpse of other football teams via the newsreels. Most of the All-American teams of the time were named by AP/UP/Hearst International newspaper sports-writers who never saw most of the players they voted on in a game, and relied upon the newspaper accounts of the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201757</url></doc>
