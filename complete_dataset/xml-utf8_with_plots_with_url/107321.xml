<plot>The movie tells the story of 'Sam Sullivan (II)' (qv), a current Vancouver City Councillor and mayoral candidate in the run-up to the 2005 Vancouver civic election. Sullivan, representing the right wing Non-Partisan Association (NPA), is a quadriplegic since the age of nineteen (he broke his neck in a skiing accident) and the movie details some of his personal life, living and working with this physical disability. He has a folksy political style which is supported within the public mindset by him being in a wheelchair. However this style masks a bulldog and somewhat vain attitude as witnessed in candid one-on-ones between Sullivan and the camera. The movie also shows the rocky relationship he has with his main mayoral candidate rival, 'Jim Green (XI)' (qv) - representing the left wing Vision Vancouver party - who is also a current Vancouver City Councillor. The movie concludes with Sullivan's election win and his global exposure four months following the election as he is presented with the Olympic flag at the closing ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107321</url></doc>
