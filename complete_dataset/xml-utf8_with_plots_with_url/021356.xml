<plot>Wake up, shower for only 5 minutes to conserve water, take the train instead of driving, sit in the cube on a recycled chair, get back on the train, buy local things, eat organic things, go to sleep on a chemical free bed. For a spiritualist of the "Millennial" generation, the tedium is unfulfilling - and he looks to conscientious consumerism to bring some meaning to an otherwise stale existence. But when his mom's life is added to the exponentially expanding list of cancer patients, his liberal lifestyle feels somehow inadequate. The catalyst for the narrator is to decide if fulfillment can be attained by upholding his mom's legacy of environmental stewardship. But if he chooses that path, he would have to acknowledge that modern society may possibly attain balance with its natural environment. Can his lifestyle somehow reach that equilibrium, or are his liberal conscientious habits a sham?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021356</url></doc>
