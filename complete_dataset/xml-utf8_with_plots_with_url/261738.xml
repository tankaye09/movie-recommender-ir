<plot>IN HOT PURSUIT is a romantic comedy about LUPITA LOPEZ, a young woman with illusions of finding Mr. Right. In Lupita's case, Mr. Right comes dressed in a policeman's uniform, mimicking her infatuation with one Officer Poncherello from the 70's TV show CHiPs. After going to great lengths to meet her ultimate boy in blue, Lupita finds out that she is cursed. She remembers that on her 10th birthday she was tricked into saying her birthday wish out loud by a bratty kid named ROCKY THE RAT. PAQUITA, her friend and co-worker, suggests Lupita break the curse. All she needs is a lime, an egg, exactly three yards of red thread and........a camel hoof. Unfazed, Lupita is determined to find the camel hoof and break the curse. Along the way she meets RICHARD COOKE. Richard and Lupita have a lot in common and she finds herself attracted to somebody that does not fit the job description. Will the curse ever be broken? Will Lupita even want to break it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261738</url></doc>
