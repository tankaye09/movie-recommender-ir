<plot>Daniel Crane is an American civil engineer who, nearing the end of a three month stint trying to help rebuild war torn Iraq, is intoxicated by the exotic people and surrounds. On the morning of his last day in Fallujah he stays for "One more cup of habibi". This is all it takes for Daniel to find himself beaten and alone, a hostage in the drama of war. As hope of living fades, he is left with one last wish, to tell his wife how much he really loves her. Lance Henriksen delivers a heart wrenching performance as Daniel Crane, taking the viewer on a deeply personal journey of heartfelt desire. A Message From Fallujah puts aside the politics and rationalisation of war, to show that in the end, it doesn't matter in what name the violence is committed. For the dead, the homeless and the orphans, the effect is still the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013156</url></doc>
