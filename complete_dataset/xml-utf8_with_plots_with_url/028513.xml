<plot>Because the driver is unable to fulfill correctly his order to kill somebody, he and his friends have to pay the price. "Alabama" is a road-movie. The camera is constantly in the back of the car shooting through the back window... But more important than this story is how the song "All Along the Watchtower" by Bob Dylan is changing when it is interpreted by Jimi Hendrix. And the recurring album of the Stones "His Satanic Majesty's Request".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?028513</url></doc>
