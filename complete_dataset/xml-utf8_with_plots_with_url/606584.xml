<plot>For many years, Hollywood movies have perpetuated the pity-filled stereotype that characters who have disabilities are unproductive losers with lousy lives. This is dangerously hurtful misinformation to society - because after the on-screen make-believe is over, the audience often has pity for people with disabilities and mistakenly believes that the most important thing in their lives is the disability (all based on the impression they've retained after seeing that "tragic" or "inspirational" story not too long ago). In the 60-second style of a film critic, a karate-wielding college journalism student who actually uses a wheelchair admonishes this worn-out characterization. Using real-life examples, he deftly illustrates how "I have a disability, and my life is *nothing* like the Hollywood stereotype" and votes THUMBS DOWN TO PITY toward people with disabilities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606584</url></doc>
