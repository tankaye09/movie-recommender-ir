<plot>Gabe, the new guy at the office, grudgingly accepts a thousand dollars to work overnight on short notice; but what he doesn't know could kill him. His crooked boss is on the run from his shady business associates, and is hoping a case of mistaken identity could save his own life, at the expense of his naive employee. But the plan rapidly unravels as Gabe's friends stop by to visit, putting his life and theirs in even greater danger. With his back to the wall, the boss is capable of anything to save his own neck. But the dark, empty office building where Gabe is working is wired with security cameras, silently recording every move.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036848</url></doc>
