<plot>Wake Up Screaming is a one-of-a-kind, behind-the-scenes look at the Vans Warped Tour through the eyes of Texas-farm-boy-turned-punk-rock-road-warrior Jason Bayless. Bayless, along with extreme documentary filmmakers David Bergthold of Blockhead Skateboards and pro skateboarder Laban Pheidias, was granted exclusive access to all aspects of the tour. Follow peta2's Jason and crew as they spend nine weeks traveling through 48 cities, rubbing elbows with the hottest bands of today and hundreds of punk rock all-stars. Watch awesome live performances from emerging new bands, including Emery, Strike Anywhere, Valient Thorr, Bleed the Dream, and more! With more than 700,000 fans in attendance, there is never a shortage of sexy groupies and crazy nights of excess. Witness all the wild backstage and on-stage happenings as Jason gets a firsthand account of this exciting lifestyle. Every night is a Saturday night and every morning is a Monday morning when you tour with the longest-running music festival on the planet!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?646139</url></doc>
