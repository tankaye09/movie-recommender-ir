<plot>Known as the Chinese Hollywood, Beiputuo, a 75-acre movie studio near Beijing, has the same glamour and excitement for Eastern culture as Universal Studios does for the West. Whatever Chinese movie makers need to produce a fabulous feature film, it all comes together at Beiputuo. And it's all because of the visionary work of a Chinese cultural hero, Mei Zi, a woman who never forgot the values she learned as a girl, struggling to get an education, and founded Beiputou, not only as a studio, but also as an artistic exchange center that carries on the traditional culture of the Chinese nation. More than just a "Look-Behind-the Scenes" place to view movie making, Beiputuo also contains a School for Performing Arts and a College for Basic Education in which one class is dedicated to poor or orphaned students that Ms. Zi pays their education and boarding. She regards it an honor to do what she can to promote the arts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064216</url></doc>
