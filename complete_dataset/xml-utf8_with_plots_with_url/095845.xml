<plot>Casey upon returning from work discovers his neighbor's goat eating his corn. He chases the goat out of the yard and, calling to his wife, tells her to fetch the box of dynamite which he has in the house. Casey then proceeds to tie several sticks of dynamite to the cornstalks. He barely finishes the work when the goat re-enters and starts eating the corn again. A terrible explosion immediately follows, which wrecks the house and blows Casey into the clouds. When the smoke clears, Casey is seen to fall into the yard. Upon recovering, he finds everything wrecked and the goat calmly looking on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095845</url></doc>
