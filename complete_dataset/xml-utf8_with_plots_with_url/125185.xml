<plot>Damselfly is the story Michael, he has no girlfriend, no friends and no life. He visits the same bar each day because he believes he is in love with the Barmaid, but he has never spoken to her. Unable to communicate, Michael is driven to imagine a love affair between them. His frustration leads to the story that is told; a story of love and death, of ends and beginnings of imagination and the real. Damselfly, shot in strong vivid colours, slips between still photography and live motion. With no live dialogue, Michael's voice-over-narrative ties the thread of the story together. A love affair that is conditioned to last only 24 hours, a journey restricted by time. An affair over before it has begun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125185</url></doc>
