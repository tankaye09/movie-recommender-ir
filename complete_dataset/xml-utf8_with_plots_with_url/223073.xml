<plot>Amar and Mansi meet through their respective families and have an arranged marriage. Amar, a book-keeper, is very thrifty, intends to save money so that they can buy their very own flat, and both to live as frugally as possible. Mansi soon gives birth to a baby boy, Bablu. Then Sapna joins Amar's firm and is asked to sit in this room, as her youth and beauty has led to distraction in the workplace. Amar reluctantly agrees to share his room with her, and is soon drawn toward her and they often go out together after work. Sapna would like to marry Amar, and asks him to tell his wife, so that the couple can separate. Amar does so, and Mansi agrees to separate on the condition that he introduces Sapna to her, and Amar agrees to do so. Watch how a pensive Mansi goes through the rest of the day - which may well culminate in her losing out to a much younger and attractive woman - a day that may change her life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?223073</url></doc>
