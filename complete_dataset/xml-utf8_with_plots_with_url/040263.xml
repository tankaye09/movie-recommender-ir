<plot>Upon returning to her childhood home, 26 year-old Angelica Mayrose discovers a old postcard from Tortuga Island in an old box. This takes Angelica back to a time before limits, when 12-year-old Angelica relives her final "make-believe" adventure with her Best Friend, Black Breath Wally, her treasured, scruffy, lovable but deeply misunderstood Pirate Companion. Angelica finds herself imprisoned on Tortuga Island by her Fearsome Nemesis, Shark-Tooth Sandy Scar and Sidekick: Pirate Bill. Angelica escapes, only to discover that she was really in her suburban home, and her "Nemesis" was really her Mother, Sandy. Angelica faces a sentence of a summer of Band Camp. She yearns to escape to high adventure.. but finds that reality has a way of catching up with you. Angelica leaves her Adventure-Escapism forever.. in favor of compromise. Angelica's Pirate is a swashbuckling tale about two friends who will do anything to stay together.. and a childhood's last hurrah.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040263</url></doc>
