<plot>Welcome to dinner, drinks and a drug war. Bo is a middle-class dad who finds a baggy of pot in a backpack belonging to his son, Josh. A flashback reveals the baggy does not belong to Josh. But, Bo is furious and uninterested in Josh's side of the story. Later, as Bo celebrates his birthday with friends at a sumptuous feast, the conversation turns to pot. Jake, a friend of the family, takes a position of tolerance, which annoys Bo. Jake launches into a surprising story about the, "war on drugs." His story starts when he innocently agrees to help his neighbor, Mrs. Cabritas, an elderly woman with glaucoma. Jake's audience is intrigued by his unpredictable adventure with Mrs. Cabritas. Through flashbacks, he describes their visit to a medical marijuana dispensary, located in a coffee shop called the RELEAF. The shop and the story are set against the backdrop of California's Proposition 215, a state law that legalized the use of medicinal marijuana. The problem is, as Jake reveals, the government refuses to recognize any state laws that conflict with federal laws. Jake goes on to describe the total chaos that erupts when the DEA stages a military-like raid of the shop. Jake's war story has a surprising ending, which appears to change the tone of the birthday party. After the dinner guests leave the confrontation between Bo and Josh continues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459630</url></doc>
