<plot>Before he became the world's most famous reggae star, Bob Marley was a farmer. Bob used to say that some day he wanted to stop playing music and go back to the farm. Now, his son Rohan is fulfilling his father's dream by starting a coffee farm in the beautiful, lush, Blue Mountains of Jamaica. Rohan decided to focus on coffee because it effects so many small, low-wage farmers worldwide. He and his family founded Marley Coffee based on the Rastafari principle of 'Ital' which brings together the concepts of fair-wage, sustainable, shade-grown, and organic farming. In this way, Rohan is helping to raise the bar of responsible, ethical farming.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411971</url></doc>
