<plot>This is a story of a friendship between two characters that have obviously had too many differences. The first one was a doctor and an Orthodox, and the other was a peasant and a Muslim. Both of them sheared the same dedication to their work. The one who was a peasant could not harvest the meadow due to the health difficulties. In spite of the doctors' disagreement, he decided to harvest the grass. Harvesting was fatal for the peasant, and the doctor ended it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338720</url></doc>
