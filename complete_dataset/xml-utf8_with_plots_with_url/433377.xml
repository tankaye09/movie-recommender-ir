<plot>The Middle Ages. When an evil knight kidnaps the king's daughter and takes her to his castle, the panther volunteers to retrieve her. However, the panther has problems with his horse who refuses to let the panther mount him, despite the many tricks and gadgets he uses. Finally, the panther trades in the horse for a dragon - but the king's daughter has already got the upper hand on the knight, and when the panther mistakenly takes the battered and bruised knight back to the king's castle, the king is anything but pleased.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433377</url></doc>
