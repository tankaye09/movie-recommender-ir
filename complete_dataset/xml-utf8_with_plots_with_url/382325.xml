<plot>Music is Fun for Everyone is a drama about an eight year old boy, Kevin, who discovers his passion for playing the piano. While his mother is very supportive, his father perceives the lessons as an unnecessary expense. The piano becomes yet another point of contention in the parents' troubled marriage, but Kevin perceives the marital problems as a direct result of his playing the piano. In his head, it becomes an either/or proposition: he can only save his family if he gives up the piano.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382325</url></doc>
