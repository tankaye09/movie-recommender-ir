<plot>Against a backdrop of usual high-school social pressures, Alicia has a real problem. The small stuff: her friends are passing around a notebook in which each reveals a sexual secret, and it's Alicia's turn to write; the safer-sex-ed teacher is passing out condoms; and, Alicia is a diver with a big meet coming up. But the real challenge is her parents, who have recently separated and aren't communicating with each other. Bills are coming due, things need attention. It's hard for Alicia to talk to either one, for different reasons: her father is distracted and self-centered; her mother is distraught and immobile. To whom can Alicia turn?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160635</url></doc>
