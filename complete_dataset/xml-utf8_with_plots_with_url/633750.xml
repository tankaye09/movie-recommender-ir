<plot>In every relationship, we make choices - sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but always with consequences. "Us" explores the nature of trust and intimacy and shows us how fragile these things are. How easily they can be broken. A woman and a man are in love. They trust each other. And everything else flows from that. But what happens if that trust is broken? What can a relationship survive? And when we are left alone, how do we live with our regrets? "Us" asks these questions by taking us into a woman's mind - where we learn, little by little, that what seemed so secure is not necessarily so, and in the middle of the night, when dreams and memory intermingle, nothing is as it appears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?633750</url></doc>
