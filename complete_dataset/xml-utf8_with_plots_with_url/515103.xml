<plot>Stella lived a quiet, predictable life. But lately, there has been a puzzling glitch in Stella's routine. Over a month ago, Stella's alarm clock was set to go off one minute later than usual. The next day, two minutes. And then three. Stella loses one minute of her life every day. When she wakes up, she is left with nothing but the haunting images of her nightmares. Are they nightmares, or the remnants of the force that is taking over her life one minute at a time? Stella seeks answers from Dr. Peck. An analyst bored with the problems of lonely housewives. But when Stella sits on his couch, gets a high stakes mind game that is more than he could have imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?515103</url></doc>
