<plot>As a teenager, Joe borrows his dad's truck and sneaks out with a girl into the woods. After his first sexual experience, his mind wanders as he drives the winding mountain road back to his house. As he comes around a corner, he hits a drunken coal miner who is walking home from the local bar. The miner dies on the road and Joe must decide what to do. After driving around all night, he decides to dump the body down the air-shaft of an old mine. Fifteen years later, most of the coal mines have shut down. Joe works a demeaning minimum wage job in a local discount store. As Joe's daughter, a product of his romantic liaison in the woods so many years ago re-enters his life, Joe finds it hard to keep his secrets hidden. Forced to confront the choices and accidents in his life, he heads for an emotional reckoning fifteen years in the making.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109539</url></doc>
