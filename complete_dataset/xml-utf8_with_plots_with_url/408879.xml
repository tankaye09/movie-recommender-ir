<plot>This docudrama outlines the effects of a severe oil and gas shortage in the United States, brought on by a hurricane damaging much of the oil infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. The drama is seen through the eyes of stock traders and analysts, a small business owner, government officials and news reporters. The story begins when the massive Hurricane Julia strikes New Orleans, La. In addition to killing thousands of people, the storm - stronger than a Category 5 storm (the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson scale) - destroys a major pipeline at Port Fourchon, La. (as well as wiping out many offshore oil rigs and refineries). As work begins to rebuild the pipeline, the price of gasoline soars to above $3 a gallon. Then, a series of events spiral the gas prices to unheard of levels of $7 per gallon or more. The most notable of these events: Two large oil tankers collide in the Port of Houston, closing that channel down; and Muslim terrorists stage a series of attacks after the United States persuades Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to alleviate the growing crisis. In the latter instance, the coup de gras comes when the terrorists kill the Saudi's oil minister and subsequently blows up sections of the Ras Tanura refinery (the world's largest). After a harsh winter in which thousands die in the bitter cold (after heating oil literally runs out in several areas), American leaders broker a deal with Russia to send 1 million barrels of oil a day to the United States to temper the crisis. But then, China steps in and outbids the Americans, and the oil is now set to be shipped there. Initially, a state of chaos rules as many Americans fear the worst, but once the shock wears off, many citizens decide to take on a new spirit of cooperation and self-sacrifice. Meanwhile, United States' diplomats do everything they can to resurrect the oil deal with Russia ... and succeed. The movie ends with the oil crisis easing (the pipelines are rebuilt and many of the refineries are back online, and oil prices falling from peaks of $130), but the Americans have learned a lesson about cheap oil and gasoline they won't soon forget.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408879</url></doc>
