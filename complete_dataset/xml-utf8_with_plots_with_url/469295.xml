<plot>"A dense thicket at Caloocan showing tropical foiliage and large trees. First one straggler, than another, then a whole body of flying Filipinos, retreating in disorder, firing occasionally, falling in the brush, and finally disappearing. A smoky haze hangs over the scene like a pall. Then comes the U.S. Infantry crouching in the underbrush, firing and advancing steadily around the waving flag. Just as the advance is in full swing the officer in command is shot. Down drops the upraised sword, and he falls forward. The scene is well chosen, and from a photographic and dramatic standpoint, the picture is an excellent one."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469295</url></doc>
