<plot>Charis is a district attorney, and his wife Liana is a dancer in a night club. Liana finds out that her husband has cancer, but she hides it from him for obvious reasons. An old friend of her husband, Ntora, who was in love with him and in whose house the couple lives, accuses Liana of infidelity, presenting as evidence a photo of her with the doctor. Charis sends her away without a second thought. In a car accident, however, Liana, seizes the opportunity to switch identities with that of the deceased woman and so completely disappears from Charis' life in order to survive on her own. In the end, of course, the truth is revealed, and the couple get back together. However, with everything that has happened in the interim, their relationship has suffered severe damage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023580</url></doc>
