<plot>Volodja, Elza, Vlatko and Nevena are all young inhabitants of Belgrade, Serbia. While more than a quarter of a million of their fellow citizens left Serbia in the past decade, this foursome remained. Ten years of Slobodan Milosevic' politics have had their effect. Sometimes not so apparent, but always there. In What's Eating Serbia? Elza wants to become famous for her father's sake, Vlatko dreams of a new Serbia, Nevena tries to live with her lies and Volodja threatens to kill an American. Their individual lives are different, but they all share the same burden. And whatever the rest of the world might say, their burden is hardly collective guilt. Their burden is anger and it's eating them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652223</url></doc>
