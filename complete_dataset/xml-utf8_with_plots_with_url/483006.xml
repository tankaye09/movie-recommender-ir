<plot>Could Mary Magdalene have been the wife of Jesus Christ and could they have had a child? And was Leonardo da Vinci the head of a centuries old secret society guarding that knowledge? Two average women, "amateur historians and citizen sleuths", will take you on a journey for the truth. Their quest for answers takes them on a hunt for the Holy Grail and whether this legendary object could actually be the bloodline of Jesus Christ. Their voyage starts in Leonardo's hometown of Vinci, Italy where the townspeople put Dan Brown and the Da Vinci Code on trial. Their verdict leads the two sleuths on a hunt for more information about Mary Magdalene and why she is considered a prostitute by some and a saint to others. As the women search for answers - they learn that history is not always what was taught in school. Their journey takes them to mysterious locations and they meet people who claim a bloodline to Christ. Their search offers many answers on the search for truth about the Holy Grail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483006</url></doc>
