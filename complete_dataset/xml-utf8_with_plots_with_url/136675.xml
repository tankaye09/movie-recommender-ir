<plot>To this day the official explanation of the Chernobyl disaster has been human error and negligence. The documentary reveals that according to geological criteria the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was wrongly located from the start. Several other European nuclear power plants are just as dangerously sited, according to various international geologists who have been trying to raise the alarm for years. The documentary shows that Chernobyl proved them right: The disaster may very well have been a result of the displacement accompanying a local earthquake twenty-two seconds before the accident. We are guided through the events on the fatal night once again and visit the sarcophagus surrounding Block 4. We examine exclusive footage shot inside it, and meet the experts who participated directly in the investigation from the very beginning. We hear about the partly suppressed statements from the staff who were on duty on the night of the accident, and look into the KGB reports.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?136675</url></doc>
