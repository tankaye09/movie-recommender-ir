<plot>Mike Burke takes on his biggest role ever! Playing 25 different characters. In this comedy Mike Burke is a one man show as not only is he the only actor but also served as the entire crew! This experimental film plays like the one man stage shows done by many great comics. Alan Putts has died but who is he? His friends, family, and those who knew him get together to tell his life story from beginning to end. Some have nice things to say some do not. We learn that he was a war hero, factory worker, radio DJ, had a dog name Poo, was addicted to sugar packets, and could whistle out of his... well you'll find out. Don't miss this wildly entertaining mocumentary full of comedy and with a splash of drama!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381310</url></doc>
