<plot>Oscar asks his girlfriend, Lulu, to marry him but she refuses. Even worse she is not sure that she wants to continue their relationship any longer. Oscar is devastated by the rejection and is uncertain what to do next. After visiting a friend who suggested the old clich√© that love conquers all, Oscar resorts to an extremely unusual method to solve the problem of Lulu's reluctance. After his local swimming pool has closed for the evening, Oscar dives in and swims to the bottom and holds his breath and waits until morning. Next morning when he is discovered, still alive, he refuses to surface until he has seen Lulu.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574600</url></doc>
