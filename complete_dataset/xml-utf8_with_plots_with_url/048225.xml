<plot>Benji is a over stressed and over-worked employee. Keeps his nose to the grindstone. When he meets Jenny, a free spirited employee, he can't get her out of his head. He finally gets up enough nerve to ask her out. She says yes, and they plan on meeting at the bar. What could go wrong? Benji waits patiently thinking that Jenny has stood him up but stays in the hopes he is wrong. Jenny is trying her best to get to bar, but forces are keeping from there: the weather, dead car, a taxi, HER SHOES. Finally after many efforts she arrives on to catch Benji leaving. She kisses him to show him that she was serious about that date even though it was ruined</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?048225</url></doc>
