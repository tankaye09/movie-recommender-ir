<plot>Chasing the Dream is a candid portrayal of eight Huntington Beach High School kids trying to obtain the impossible -- a career in professional surfing. The teens must steer through the ranks of scholastic surfing while dealing with injuries, overbearing parents, demanding school curriculums and a trip to Australia aimed at separating the ones who surf from the ones who win. Narrated by Gary Busey and featuring interviews with surfing legends Kelly Slater, Tom Carroll and Mark Richards, Chasing the Dream is a coming of age story about kids who will do anything to achieve their dream of becoming a pro surfer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100801</url></doc>
