<plot>Set in the glacial snow-white backdrop of Alaska, Arctic Diamond follows four teams during their 3-day race to turn a monumental block of ice into a magnificent masterpiece in the coldest and toughest, most definitely the noisiest, competition on the planet. The teams battle it out, competing against the best in the World Ice Art Championships. In one of the most hostile and unpredictable environments on earth, they are tested not only on physical endurance and stamina but also on talent and artistic ability: it is a full-throttle competition in the art of ice sculpting. Arctic Diamond is an extreme adventure documentary, intended to amaze and entertain as we travel to the interior of Alaska to experience and explore... the world of ice sculpting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044828</url></doc>
