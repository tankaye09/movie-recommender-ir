<plot>Hsiong, a young narcotics officer, hooks up through comic accidents with a party girl named Witty. She shops, plays mahjongg, and charges him for every kiss, and they are in love. When he dies in the line of duty, his ghost stays around for a few weeks, hoping to get Witty's attention, trying futilely face to face and by phone, and then through a relative of hers who claims to have occult powers. Through this shadow cop's investigations, it comes to light how he died and where $10 million is that was the cause of his death. Before he disappears into the void, they leave each other final messages. Can their last wishes come true?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?492149</url></doc>
