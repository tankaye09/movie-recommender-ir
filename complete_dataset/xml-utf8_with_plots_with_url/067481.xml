<plot>The metaphor of a shipwreck, survival, and rebuilding serves as a backdrop to South Africans talking about the challenges and rewards of democracy and freedom. White and Black voices comment as animators give faces and images to the speakers and their words. For the White South Africans, it's finding themselves anew after the certainty of their future and the security of power are gone; for the Black South Africans, it's finding their way in a society of high unemployment but individual possibilities. At the end, we meet the five principal speakers as a chorus sings, "Freedom is here, tell me what's next."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067481</url></doc>
