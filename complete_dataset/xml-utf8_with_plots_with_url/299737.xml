<plot>Kutty Srank is a short-tempered, lonely, but law-abiding boatman whose work leads him to travel the back waters of Kerala. One day, when the local police station discovers an unidentified body washed ashore, three women come forward claiming it to be the dead body of Kutty Srank. Each of the three women - a rich women aspiring to be a Buddhist nun, a convict, and a mute - all claim to be Kutty Srank's wife. Kutty Srank ultimately leaves behind a story of a man who convinced three very different women he was a committed and faithful husband while successfully keeping his other two lives a secret.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?299737</url></doc>
