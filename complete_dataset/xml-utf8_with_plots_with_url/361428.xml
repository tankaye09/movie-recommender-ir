<plot>Mauricio Dias and Walter Riedweg often say that their studio is the street. It is from the observation of street life and the people in it that their installations about encounters, identity and territoriality emerge. Brazilian artist Dias met Swiss Riedweg in 1993. They found out that, together, they were able to potentialise their ideas. "This marriage became Mau Wal", recalls Dias. In this documentary, they present their oeuvre and the different characters behind the work: people who make up everyday life in big cities. Street sellers of a north-eastern immigrant community market in São Paulo, illegal immigrants in search of an European dream, street teenagers and their memories. By means of stories or of the role it plays, the human element always takes centre stage in the work of the Mau Wal duo.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361428</url></doc>
