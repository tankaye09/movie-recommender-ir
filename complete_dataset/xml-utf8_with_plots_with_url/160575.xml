<plot>DROP POINT was first produced in Germany in 1999 under the title FALLING ROCKS. Critically-acclaimed, this taut, contemporary thriller follows six friends on an annual hiking adventure deep in the Arizona desert. When the hikers stumble across a dead parachutist carrying a fortune in uncut diamonds, trouble begins. With no means of communication with the outside world and unable to reach a consensus on what to do with the stones, they agree to pack the treasure out and decide along the way. As they hike back toward civilization, members of the group begin dying under mysterious circumstances. Is someone following them? Or is there a killer in their midst? The stakes rise as their numbers dwindle. Who will make it out of the desert alive?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160575</url></doc>
