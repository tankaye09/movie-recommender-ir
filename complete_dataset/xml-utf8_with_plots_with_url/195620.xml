<plot>This picture gives a good idea of how soon one of the New York fireboats can be gotten under way after they receive an alarm of fire. The men are seen running on board the boat, taking their respective places, casting off the lines, etc. The boat is on its way to the fire in almost an instant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195620</url></doc>
