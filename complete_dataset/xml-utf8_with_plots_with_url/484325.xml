<plot>A lecturer tells us that it's National Take Care Of Week, but take care of what? Probably your health, he surmises. Cut to Joe Doakes's household: he's been outside in the garden when a bee stings him. His brother-in-law, a worrier, thinks maybe it was a black widow spider, and he insists that Joe rush to see a physician. At the clinic, a nurse takes a long time filling out the forms, and the doctor is tied up talking on the phone to a child; when the doctor finally he examines Joe's hand, will it be too late?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484325</url></doc>
