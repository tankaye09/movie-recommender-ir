<plot>"The Outpost" was named after Harrison Gray Otis's country retreat in the rural Hollywood of the 1910's. Otis was the first editor of the Los Angeles Times. The "Outpost" sign was once the largest neon sign in the world and stood above Runyon and Outpost Canyons in the Hollywood Hills during the 1920s, 30s and 40s. The red neon sign, built to promote C. E. Toberman's "Outpost Estates" real estate development, was a rival at that time to the Hollywoodland sign, and amazingly has been brought out of the past by Huell, Bob and Steve. The show uncovers this California landmark, as it currently lies obscured by weeds and dirt above the modern day Runyon Canyon Hills. It also reviews the history and architecture of the "Outpost Estates".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641902</url></doc>
