<plot>Natale, an old man, decided to send a video message to wish Merry Christmas to his daughter who moved from Sicily to the United States to become an actress. He is about to begin shooting when Salvo, a thief, steals the precious video camera from him that he had bought after so many sacrifices. After a series of ups and downs, Niccolo', the thief's son, decides to give the camcorder back to Natale, because he is aware of the importance of that recorded message.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?259175</url></doc>
