<plot>An illusionist and his assistant present a series of amazing acts, afterword's revealing to the audience how these tricks are performed. The fact that the explanations are even more incredible than the tricks themselves enhances the power of illusion. As the illusions become more and more astonishing, it's discovered that these are not tricks at all, but real. From that moment on, reality and illusion are inseparable from each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351876</url></doc>
