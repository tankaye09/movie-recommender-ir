<plot>Nelson is the youngest and has always rebelled from the conservative, middle class background she grew up in by engaging in all the activities her family disapprove of; drink, drugs and casual sex. Archie is the typical, troubled middle child who struggles to earn the approval of his older sister. He has never been good at confronting problems and we soon discover what it was that caused him to run away and cut all contact with his family several years ago. Mabel the eldest sibling, has always tried to do the right thing and strives for perfection in all things. She is trapped in an unhappy marriage but keeps up appearances for the sake of convention. She is the most profoundly affected by the discoveries that are made and as her world collapses around her she is unsure if she can continue or if she should end it all. All three siblings need to overcome the shock of their discovery and their personal flaws to carry on with their lives and to try and accept each other as they are. They need to put their differences behind them if Mabel is going to cope with the shocking news they have discovered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108328</url></doc>
