<plot>Spend a lifetime in thirty minutes with the film-maker recognized by the Whitney Museum in New York City as a pioneer in experimental filmmaking... and a fun guy! The biography follows the life and accomplishments of the late filmmaker, painter, sculptor &amp; war veteran - Carmen D'Avino, from his landing on Utah Beach during D-Day, through the liberation of Paris, his world travels and back home to New York City for the cultural renaissance of the 60's &amp; 70's. During this time, two of his short films are nominated for Academy Awards. In later years in upstate New York, he has broadened his skills in sculpting large figures in wood &amp; stone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584971</url></doc>
