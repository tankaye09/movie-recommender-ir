<plot>BADAL SOMENANI is a famous successful BOLLYWOOD writer/director and he is all excited to shoot his new film 'BOLLYWOOD BLUES' in New York, USA. His producer ROCKY 'BALBOA' SINGH (huge SYLVESTER STALLONE fan) arrives a month before in NYC to make arrangements for the film. A week before the shoot, Rocky shockingly finds out that Badal's 'P1 Entertainment Visa' (nonimmigrant visa) is cancelled because his name is an anagram for 'OSAMA BIN LADEN'. Rocky sees his huge investment going down the drain. Badal comes out clean and confesses that his script for 'Bollywood Blues' is a scene to scene copy of Once-Upon-A-Time-Famous-Independent-Award-Winning writer/director BARRY O'NEIL's indie hit 'BROOKLYN BLUES'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078203</url></doc>
