<plot>Mike comes back home from work and proceeds to wash his face. He uses the soap freely, and with his eyes covered with lather gropes about for a towel. Unfortunately, he seizes a rag with which his wife has been blacking the stove. The result is very ludicrous, but when Mike's wife takes him to the looking-glass he becomes greatly provoked and proceeds to black her face also.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248175</url></doc>
