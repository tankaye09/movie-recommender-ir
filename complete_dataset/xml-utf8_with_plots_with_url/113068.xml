<plot>Another picture bound to draw forth applause and a hearty laugh. It is a picture that is always certain to delight the young and please the old; very, very laughable. Did you ever see the "Two Old Sports"? Then this you should have, as it is quite as funny. It is a story of old times.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113068</url></doc>
