<plot>When fate brings two souls together, sometimes they cannot be torn apart- even after death. On a fateful day in the park, a lonely man meets Morella, a beautiful yet singularly bewitching woman. And from their first meeting their souls become inseparable, their lives bound together forever. Morella is a woman of great intelligence and powers of the mind, she spends her days studying the occult and reading to the man from her collection of ancient texts. Given his devotion to his wife, the man abandons himself completely to her, as their life of seclusion and obsession grows darker with each passing day. Joy fades into the deepest horror as Morella's cold, distant nature and ghostly musical voice oppress the man until he can no longer bear the touch of her fingers, nor the luster of her melancholy eyes. Yet, as the years roll away and with a terrible sickness Morella's life declines, will the eternal bond between these two souls be allowed to end, and will the child she carries within her live on, even after her death?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377306</url></doc>
