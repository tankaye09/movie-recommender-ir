<plot>Ever wonder how they ever managed to make a movie like Orgazmo? Well, bickering duo Elder Tom and Elder Mattt host this tour of the mind of creator Trey Parker and what inspired him to make the movie. Even interviewed are the cast and crew, even features scenes of the original 16mm trailer and more never seen footage. Also discussed is "Does shaving your balls really make the ol' johnson look bigger, how fans loved the movie, collected the merchandise and danced the disco music. Also shown are behind-the-scenes looks at the movie, as well as how difficult each effect was in doing since they didn't have the convenience of computer animation back then.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545237</url></doc>
