<plot>Here is decided novelty. The figure is very large and the facial expression is wonderful to a marked degree. A man is seated at a table on which is lying a revolver and a bottle of whiskey. He pours out a drink, and is about to swallow it when he stops to reason with himself. Laying aside the whiskey, he seizes the revolver and places it to his temple, is about to blow out his brains, when he again changes his mind and drinks the whiskey. We consider this to be one of the finest life motion pictures ever made.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?098835</url></doc>
