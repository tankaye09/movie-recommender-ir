<plot>This dance is usually held at night, the Redskins dancing around with blazing pine knots in their hands. But for obvious reasons the government authorities would not permit the festivities at night so the Indians resolved to give it in daylight. They claim it had never before been given in sunshine -- and it never will again, according to the federal people. It is an especially interesting series of dances and will strengthen up any weak spots you may have in your programme. It is good enought to draw a crowd every night for a week, especially if you can have tom-tom music behind the screen to add realism to the scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264293</url></doc>
