<plot>The Turning Point is a personal journey through a couple's adventure to becoming new parents; through all the highs and lows of pregnancy. Once the baby is born a whole new story begins to develop. The filmmaker and his wife must adjust to the steep learning curve of being new parents, the very little sleep and their old lives now gone forever; replaced by a crying, eating machine who they have to learn how to love. The Turning Point is a funny, heartwarming and honest film; edited in a very tight, almost dream like fashion. It is a story that most people go through at least once in their lives, but told in way and from a perspective that has not been seen before.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597480</url></doc>
