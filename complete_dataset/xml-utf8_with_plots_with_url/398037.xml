<plot>In June 2001 a group of 3000 cyclists leave San Francisco for Los Angeles to raise money for AIDS service organizations. The seven-day event # known as the California Aids Ride - covers nearly 600 miles of the state's scenic coast and Central Valley. Each rider has a personal reason for going the distance but they all have one thing in common: their lives have been touched by AIDS. Over the course of the ride they grieve for lost friends and family members, voice concern for the ever-expanding pandemic and unite in life embracing support of one another. During the ride, the world marked the 20th anniversary of the first identification of AIDS. Even though medications have been developed to prolong the lives of those living with the disease, there is still no cure and no vaccine. NO DISTANCE TOO FAR is a reminder that AIDS is still a significant problem in our world and that we must all take responsibility for the disease.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398037</url></doc>
