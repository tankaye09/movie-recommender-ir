<plot>Joseph is here seen at work, when Mary slowly comes down the side path leading to the exterior workshop. As she sits, unnoticed by Joseph, the child Jesus, then twelve years old, lightly follows after her, carrying a small cross, which he drops and kneels at her feet. As she caresses him, Joseph turns and kisses him. Mary and Jesus depart and shortly after Joseph lays aside his implements and follows them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425380</url></doc>
