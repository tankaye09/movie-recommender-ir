<plot>One woman dreams of being a pop star, but must stay and take care of her mother who suffers from delusions of seeing her long lost son who was taken away during communism years ago. The other woman is a pop star but the price she has paid for this role is too high for she is the wife of a mafia leader who has made her who she is. The two women are brought together by an American Paparazzi who both women ironically see as their escape. However, he has his own set of worries when he takes some pictures he shouldn't have taken, and is hunted by the pop star's husband.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220154</url></doc>
