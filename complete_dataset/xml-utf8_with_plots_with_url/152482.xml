<plot>DIVINE LIGHT follows noted Art Student's League Master Teacher Frank Mason from his painting studio for 50 years above Cafe Roma on Mott Street to Italy where he revisits his greatest artistic achievement which hangs in an 11th century Venetian Church. Returning back home to Little Italy and to the New York landmark Old St. Patrick's Cathedral he reflects on the artist's life. He contemplates his calling to be a painter and the true meaning of his powerful painting 'Resurrection' that hangs there behind the altar.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152482</url></doc>
