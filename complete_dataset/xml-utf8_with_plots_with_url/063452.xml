<plot>Begging For Shorts is a Shorts Collection of 5 award winning gay shorts. 'Sunflowers' - Devon and his new beau learning the lessons of relationships through communication, intimacy, quarrels, and forgiveness. It's a delightful movie about growing up. 'Masturbation: Putting the Fun into Self-Loving'  - Dr. Sigmund Winston, along with the help of his trusty sidekick Billy, teaches the students of the '50s how to put more excitement into self-loving. Boys from the local YMCA and visual aids give the audience a simple step-by-step approach to loving themselves. 'Drag Queen Heist' - The robbing adventures of Bobby and Jared. Jared comes up with an infallible plan to rob the 2nd Fidelity Bank as women. Regrettably Jared's boyfriend and co-conspirator, Bobby, is anything but infallible. 'Begging for Change' -  Two universes unfold from a coin toss, leading a homeless teen on parallel paths of redemption and desperation. Will either path take him home? Bonus Short: 'And The Award Goes to...' - Another parody looking into the life of the filmmaker and festival hit, Masturbation: Putting the Fun into Self-loving. In this parody, J.T. Tepnapa is nominated for Best Short Film on Hollywood's biggest night. But behind the thank yous and lies on stage, hides the true Hollywood story. How do movies really get made? Loaded with commentaries, extras, docu-shorts, &amp; more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063452</url></doc>
