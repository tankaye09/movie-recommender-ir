<plot>Race car driver Frank Cermak is in love with Jane Harris. Jane and her parents watch Frank win a tight race from Bill Peters, an army lieutenant on leave. Peters tries to foul Frank, and Frank beats him in a fist fight after the race. Frank is drafted into the army and (against staggering and overwhelming odds) finds Lt. Peters to be his commanding officer. Jane's father refuses Frank permission to marry Jane, but Jane tells him she will marry him regardless. Needing money, Frank has his army buddy, Matt Hall, enter him in a race. Peters, making life miserable for Frank, confines him to the post, but he sneaks away, enters the race, and crashes. Peters, as life and luck would have it in a "Slash" Clements movie, is on hand and disciplines him severely, causing Frank to stand up Jane on their wedding day. But, since all the luck in a Clements movie isn't bad - just the scripts, the post arsenal catches fire and Frank saves Peters' life. The latter brings Frank and Jane together, and arranges for them to be married immediately.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045743</url></doc>
