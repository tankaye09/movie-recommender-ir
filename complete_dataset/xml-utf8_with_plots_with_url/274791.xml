<plot>Jean is childless housewife who has grown tired of her day-to-day, thankless grind. Her husband Dan barely knows she exists and thinks of her only as an errand girl. Confined to the house, she cleans the same spots over and over again. However, this all changes one night when Dan is not home. A homeless derelict, Tom, stumbles onto their front lawn, nearly unconscious. Jean immediately takes him to their outside shed, keeping him a secret from Dan. The secret relationship between Jean and Tom grows and in the process Tom helps Jean realize that she and Dan have been living a complete lie. Jean is now forced to tackle her biggest fears by facing the true nature of her and Dan's relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274791</url></doc>
