<plot>Every year in Monterey, California thousands of people gather from around the globe to attend the world's largest and most famous automobile extravaganza. It's referred to as Monterey Week. Hundreds of exotic automobiles are auctioned off at numerous car auctions and the surrounding street flow with the rarest cars in existence. Wayne Carini is considered to be one of the best automotive restorers in the nation and we follow him from his restoration shop in Connecticut to Monterey. Wayne gives us an insiders view of the cars, money and dealings that make this event a must attend if you're at all interested to the car world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376357</url></doc>
