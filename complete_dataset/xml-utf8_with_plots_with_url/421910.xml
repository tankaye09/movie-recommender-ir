<plot>This film, taken from the deck of the harbor police boat "Patrol," gives a splendid view of what is appropriately called "The American Venice." Beginning opposite Fulton ferry the "Patrol" swerved around in a circle, bringing into view first the great span of the Brooklyn Bridge from one end to the other, then the crowded masses of shipping along the river front, while in the distance the sky-scrapers stand as so many magnificent monuments to the wealth and business enterprise of America's great metropolis.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421910</url></doc>
