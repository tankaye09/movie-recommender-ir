<plot>This in-depth history of Oregon's beaches focuses on the political ebb and flow of efforts to keep the coast accessible to the public.

Featuring interviews with many of the living key players as well as voices from the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?437892</url></doc>
