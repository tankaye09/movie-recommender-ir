<plot>Can a love for filmmaking be taught? Darren Heroux, a self-described film obsessive, always dreamed of being an "auteur" -- a director of distinction. But his dream proved hard to fulfill. Faced with rejection from film schools he opted for a different path to fame. Why not start again? From scratch? So he enlisted the help of his newborn daughter Sophie and embarked on a three year endeavor to teach her the art of filmmaking. The result is "Little Auteur", a no budget documentary about the filmmaking process but also a cautionary tale of one man's unfulfilled obsession.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337836</url></doc>
