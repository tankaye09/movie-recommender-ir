<plot>The journey is endless, taking countless generations to complete. They're our distant descendants and they are all that's left of our race. Hundreds of years into the future, the world has ended and humanity is traveling to a distant, new home. But it's here, in the middle of their journey, that everything is about to change. The Forgotten Future is the story of Vega, a lonely young boy struggling to find his place in a world much bigger than him. Led only by a dream, Vega comes to question their world and discovers that humanity has lost something very important along the way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558834</url></doc>
