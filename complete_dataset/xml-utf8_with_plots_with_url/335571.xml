<plot>Set in in suburban Los Angeles, "Life is Nice..." is a comedic post, post-modern tale of love, friendship, perhaps boredom and a girl. A wacky surreal world where nothing is what it seems. While following their often humorousadventures, the film explores the relationship between two old friends, Josh (Forest), and Silo (Mike Dytri), as they try to find the meaning in their quite often meaningless existence. The film'spivotal character is Clara (Kia Collin), Josh's Domineering and often manipulative girlfriend. As Clara plays the emotions of the two friends against each other, they discover just what their friendship is made of &amp; what a girlfriend is or isn't.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335571</url></doc>
