Later that evening while her mother (Julie Kendall) is at work, she leads herself into a night of drinking, self-mutilation and distrucive behavior. This is her last chance to wake herself up before her alter ego begins to fully take over. In the morning she has no recollection of what happened the night before. What or who would end all her deep pain and suffering? Her enemy is here to save her.
