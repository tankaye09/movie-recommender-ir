<plot>Interviews with friends of the late Jim Morrison and several people involved with the making of the film, The Doors (1991), delve into what Morrison meant to everyone including themselves. The film really only touched the surface of what Jim actually did, several other things he did are told here. This is not an actual look into the movie, but rather a look at Jim's career and friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?587283</url></doc>
