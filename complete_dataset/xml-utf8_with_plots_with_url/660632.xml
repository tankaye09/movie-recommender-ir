<plot>Word on the Street is an action comedy about a small time New York drug dealer gets caught up in the fast night life of the city. His key to this world is a rich adult trust fund kid named JOEY GALAXY. Joey owns a few clubs in the Manhattan and is a minor media celebrity. Joey is also the dealer's best customer. The two become friends and party together frequently. The dealer has the time of his life while making a small fortune selling drugs to Joey who is a massive coke head. He goes out all night with plenty of drugs, loud music and loose women and lives the life of a minor rock star until Joey gets pinched by the police and is forced to set his friend up. The dealer is arrested by Lt. PATRICK TOSTONE a rouge alcoholic police officer who commands a rag-tag unit of police criminals nicknamed 'the Tostones' on the streets. The corrupt police squad doesn't arrest the drug dealer or ask him to snitch right away. Instead they force him to remain dealing on the street and kicking up to them. Eventually, their tribute increases to the point where the drug dealing is giving them all his money. He is now in a $15,000 debt to his boss and cousin TITO OCHOA. Tito's patience is starting to wear thin and he wants his money or else he's going to do something drastic. Hustling has never been this funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660632</url></doc>
