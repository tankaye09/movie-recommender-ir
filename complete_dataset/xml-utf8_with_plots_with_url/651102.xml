<plot>Edgar, his wife and his brother-in-law are riding through the desert in a convertible to see a restaurant that Edgar has purchased sight unseen. They camp in a ghost town and Edgar sees a "Gold Nugget Restaurant" sign and it dawns on him that is his purchase. Inside, Edgar runs into two outlaws who force him to drive them to the next town. Unknown to Edgar, Sally lassos the renegades out of the back seat, while Edgar drives on in his (usual) blissful state of ignorance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651102</url></doc>
