<plot>Rohit Kumar (Aamir Khan) is an aspirant playback singer while Kiran (Manisha Koirala) is a classical singer-in-training, but at inside aims to be some thing like Rohit. They meet, relate to each other's sentiments and fall in love. But when Kiran's parents oppose their marriage, they decide to lead a seperate life. However, after their marriage, Kiran's ambitions take a back seat as she feels suppressed by her household responsibilities and her child's look after. Time fails to abate Kiran's frustration until she decides to leave Rohit and start a new life all over again. Now-a-loner, Rohit is forced to look after both his son and his falling career on his own, and that too at the same time. After some obvious teething troubles, Rohit succeeds in creating a seperate world of their own with Sonu, his son. Meanwhile, Kiran incidentally becomes a huge film star. She then tries to reconcilliate but as luck would have it, Rohit, an ego-centric man, misinterprets her support as her pity and things become worse. Having had enough, Kiran decides to call the marriage off and also files a case demanding Sonu's custody. Rohit, unlike Kiran, faces a real tough time preparing for the case. But as case continues, Kiran realises Rohit's importance for Sonu and vice-versa. However, the court as expected gives orders in Kiran's favour. But in the end, Kiran decides to compensate for all her mistakes and Rohit and she decide to start afresh all over again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027619</url></doc>
