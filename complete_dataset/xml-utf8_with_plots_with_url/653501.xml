<plot>Twenty years prior to the Revolutionary War, the British, French and Native American Empires seek to possess the American wilderness. Conflict ignites as 22-year-old George Washington steps onto the world stage as the murderer of a French emissary. In the subsequent battle of Fort Necessity, the emissary's brother leads a French army that defeats Washington. These events lead to the 1755 campaign of British General Edward Braddock and George Washington against the French in the wilderness. With the British a day away, a charismatic French officer leads his French/Indian force in an improbable attack on Braddock's column. The resulting battle will change American history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653501</url></doc>
