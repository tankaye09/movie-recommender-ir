<plot>Two days in the bizarre life of narcissistic, drugged-up yuppie Alex DeMello, as he attempts to uncover the sinister secrets of his demonic company superiors, but ends up losing his briefcase, his car, his friends, and his mind. During his trip across the bad side of the city, he stumbles across car-wrecking psychopaths, all-seeing telephone operators, a knife-wielding skate-boarder, and finally his indestructible corporate rival. A dark, dream-like psychological thriller about urban paranoia, yuppie greed, corporate manipulation, mind-altering substances, sex, death, betrayal, and a cuddly toy called Mr Buttons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052031</url></doc>
