<plot>Shruti [child artiste Hansika Motwani] is the 10-year-old daughter of Shrikant [Sanjay Kapoor] and Shraddha [Raveena Tandon]. She travels to her school by the local train every morning. One day, she accidentally gets locked up in her school and by the time she catches a train to go home, it is already midnight. Three young drug addicts also board the train and seeing her alone, they rape her in front of three passengers who seem afraid and helpless to come to her aid. Shruti is brought in an unconscious state to the hospital by the police. She breathes her last in front of her aggrieved parents. The city is shocked by this untoward incident. The case is handed over to Kripa Shankar Thakur [Manoj Bajpai], an upright and honest cop from the Crime Branch. From here starts an unusual legal battle between the honest and the corrupt.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271686</url></doc>
