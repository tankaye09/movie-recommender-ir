<plot>In this game format, a panel of Flemish celebrities is asked to 'bet' (to which the Dutch title refers) whether the successive proposed, at first sight improbable stunts are feasible; some are entirely the work of the contestants which enter them, other may involve participation from the audience or the public at large. Panel members who bet wrong must make good on some feasible but entertaining (e.g. somewhat humiliating) bet of their own, which is then filmed to be showed at the next episode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649395</url></doc>
