<plot>The campus free spirit and scam artist has been GIVEN a bar in tropical paradise. All he has to do is pass a drug test that is impossible. Knowing he failed, he plans the ultimate heist to steal back his tainted specimen and replace it with a clean specimen. The campus pretty boy has spent his four year college career hard at work trying to win a bet he made during his first week of college freshman year, stating he would sleep with 100 women by the time he graduated. He has to sleep with one more woman to win the bet, but with just 12 hours to go in the bet and everyone he has ever crossed while in pursuit of number 100 looking for revenge before he leaves campus forever, winning the bet is the last thing on his mind. Now, he just wants to survive. Two different people, two different stories, colliding in one entertaining film. This film has no profanity or nudity, but promises to deliver over 99 guilty pleasures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007233</url></doc>
