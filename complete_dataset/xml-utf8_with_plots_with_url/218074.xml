<plot>After years of self-inflicted punishment, an unplanned pregnancy forces Cara to come to terms with her past. Struggling to survive on the gritty lower-east side of Manhattan in a world of art, music, drugs and alcohol, she is compelled to paint again, rousing the muse she once sacrificed. As Cara's art evolves, her buried truth is exposed - teaching her that to forgive others heals the heart, but to forgive the self heals the soul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218074</url></doc>
