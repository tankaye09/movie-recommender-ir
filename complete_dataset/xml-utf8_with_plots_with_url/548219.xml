<plot>A 'how low can you go'-style game in the tradition of The Gong Show, this program pitted two contestants against each other in a test of wits. A question would be asked of a pair of celebrities, one of whom would give a correct answer, then other giving an incorrect one. The contestant (who had a loved one standing with him in the studio) would then have to choose which one was telling the truth. If correct, he would receive a point, while his opponent's love one would receive some form of punishment. If incorrect, however, his own loved one would be punished while his opponent would receive the point. The winner of this match would go on to the bonus round, where their bonus prize would be decided by which hole the program's pet rat would crawl down first.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548219</url></doc>
