<plot>The vacuum echo of sound silently retreats from the milk bottle manifest. Hidden away in the shadow of light the leading role is cast for unseen immorality as the logic of thought lurks fallow in your cerebral membrane. A milliard bacteria are keeping time to tennis play, drawing shapes in rhythmical sequences under the soles of innumerable shoes. Do you ever think about what that means? How life's myth gains shape the moment our concluding thoughts stop our senses. Under the screeching sound of hand breaks we translate our perceptions, 7002 is a film made for the unconditioned senses. In the past Hotel &amp; Duvel have earned their credits creatively in the concrete jungle and in the present they stretch the boundaries of street and urban clich√©s. They're responsible for a film that will engage the minds of future thinkers. Life is not linear for those who walk the asphalt with a free state of mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006708</url></doc>
