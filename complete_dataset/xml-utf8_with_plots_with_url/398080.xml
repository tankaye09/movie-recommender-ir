<plot>"No Exit" is a thriller loosely based on the famous French play "Huis Clos" by Jean-Paul Sartre. Jonathan and Leigh wake up in strange motel room after being sedated. There is no escape from the room - the door is locked from the outside, there are no windows and the room seems to defy the laws of physics as they can't break through what appears to be normal sheet rock. Trapped in the room together, they are forced to confront the marital problems that they were able to ignore in their normal lives. Leigh was having an affair - Jonathan asked a stranger to follow her. Neither knows that that they were dealing with the same person, a man named Nicholas, who is also responsible for kidnapping them. He communicates with them in the room, pitting them against each other. Their dark secrets rip their marriage apart as they try to hide the truth. But in a bid to get what he really wants, Nicholas won't let them hide it for long - there are many secrets, including the truth about the motel room. "No Exit" explores the darker nature of relationships, cheating, and what it means to be trapped in an undesirable relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398080</url></doc>
