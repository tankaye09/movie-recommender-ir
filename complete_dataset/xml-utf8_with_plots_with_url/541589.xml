<plot>Errol is at the end of a very long week as manager of his bookstore. As he closes his shop, a stranger bursts in with an intriguing query: to find the artist whose painting so deeply moved him recently in Florence, Italy. The stranger has just one clue: the painter's name written phonetically as "Jack Car-roo-see". Is there something about that name? As the man's story unfolds and the search begins, the two strangers uncover astonishing connections to the painting and each other that neither could have predicted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541589</url></doc>
