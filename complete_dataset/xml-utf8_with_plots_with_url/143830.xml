<plot>With a nutty campaign manager and hormonally supercharged daughter at his side; nice guy and long-shot candidate, Dexter Dickie, just wants to do some good for North Dakota as he bumbles through its beautiful back roads and sleepy town halls in his quest to become Governor. Unfortunately, after a night of polka festivities, Dexter accidentally rear-ends a UFO - Try explaining THAT to the American people, much less the insurance company. Enter Tony, the schlock-B Hollywood producer hired to put Dexter back on track. Already facing impossible odds, soon the campaign spirals down onto the rocks of bizarre election strategies, nefarious opponents, exploding rodents, cavorting showgirls, pissed off mothers, back stabbing ex wives, and a voting public that is beginning to think Dexter is going a little crazy. Now, with the world watching, Dexter must fight to maintain his family, his sanity, his hair and his one shot at the Governor's mansion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143830</url></doc>
