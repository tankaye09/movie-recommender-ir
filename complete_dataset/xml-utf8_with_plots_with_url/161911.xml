<plot>Radha lives a poor lifestyle in Brindavan, India. When London-based Deepak Rai comes for a visit, they meet, fall in love and get married. Deepak returns home and informs his parents, who are displeased as they have arranged his marriage with Dolly, the daughter of Kuldeep's friend, Sukhdev Thakur. Shortly thereafter Deepak gets the news that Radha is dead. This news does devastate him, but Dolly assists him, both become friends, and he agrees to marry her. Shortly before the marriage he becomes aware of Radha's presence in his house but his parents scoff at this. What Deepak does not know is that Radha is still alive, has found her way to London, is living in the local Hare Krishna Mandir, had visited his house, performed prayers, but is now held captive on the instructions of his dad and Sukhdev - who have already instructed a hit-man to kill her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161911</url></doc>
