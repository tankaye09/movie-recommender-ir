<plot>In a Welsh village, the last of the local Gypsy musicians has died. The wind is blowing hard at the grave of Laszlo Ferencs, as the priest, a few friends, and four musicians wait for the coffin to be lowered into the ground. The priest's words are difficult to hear in the wind, as is the music of the players. But in the town, the music is blowing in the wind; it descends on and enchants people as they repair a fence, hang clothes to dry, write a letter, knit, or sit for tea. The music breathes rhythm and delight into one and all, including the sexton.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559428</url></doc>
