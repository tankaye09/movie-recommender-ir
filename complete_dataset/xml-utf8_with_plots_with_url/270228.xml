<plot>A window into what really happens when teachers address lesbian and gay issues with their students in age-appropriate ways. With footage shot in six public and independent schools across the US, the film takes viewers inside first through eighth grade classrooms to find out what young students have to say about a topic that often leaves adults tongue-tied. Explores what children already know about gay people, the concerns and questions on their minds, and how addressing anti-gay prejudice in the classroom is connected to preventing violence, supporting families, and promoting social equality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270228</url></doc>
