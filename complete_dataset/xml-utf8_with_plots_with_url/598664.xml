<plot>"The Van Halen Story: The Early Years" chronicles the rise of four young musicians from their formative years to their transformation into a worldwide phenomenon. Witness the group's tale told by the people who were there when it began - the childhood friends, fellow musicians, roadies, bodyguards, producers, and the band themselves. Covers all the years with David Lee Roth, and concentrates mostly on the club days and the first world tour. Includes interviews with many people who were very close to the band. Narrated by J. J. Jackson.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598664</url></doc>
