<plot>The unintended consequences that sometimes come from acting on our deepest impulses. Peter is a middle aged man who has had recent set backs both personally and professionally. His latest personal failure with recent girlfriend Maggie leads him to try a popular erectile dysfunction drug. In his desperation for things to work out, Peter takes too many pills and finds himself in the throes of a humiliating case of priapism. As time passes, his condition does not, and Peter is forced to seek medical treatment. Peter and Maggie meet Doctor Shneidel, who has a rather unique take on Peter's problem. In the end, Doctor Shneidel can provide little relief other than refer Peter to a specialist who has an opening for an appointment in two days. This news presents a fresh quandary; Peter must give a career defining presentation the following day. Facing almost certain disgrace, Peter has no choice but to go to work in his excited state. But all does not go as expected and through a series of events Peter begins to realize that perhaps he should not lament his condition but embrace it. Peter does just that; consequences be damned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196121</url></doc>
