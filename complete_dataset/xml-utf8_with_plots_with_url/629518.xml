<plot>While working a car insurance scam, Toni Cutter, a female con artist, accidentally turns a routine collision into a fatality and exposes her lawyer and lover, Stephen Tally, to felony murder charges from the District Attorney. Stephen stalls his interrogators with stories of his affair with Toni, while she risks her freedom by seducing an employee in the D.A.'s office into revealing Stephen's whereabouts. As they each play out their own con, the line between rescuer and executioner, betrayer and martyr become blurred and they must learn to trust each other in order to survive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629518</url></doc>
