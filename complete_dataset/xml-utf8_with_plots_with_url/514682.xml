Max and Emily are a couple who live in a world of their own. Recluses, they never go outside and keep themselves to themselves in their dark confined house. However, this increasingly gloomy environment intrigues Emily's attraction to the gleaming light of the outside world. She decides she wants to venture out by obtaining a job. Max has great difficulty in accepting this for fear of loosing her. As Emily gradually builds the courage to leave, odd things begin to happen as Max's need for control spirals.
