<plot>A documentary about the struggle for survival of traditional art and culture in the face of a rapidly changing and modernizing world told from the perspective of time-honored Chinese Kung Fu masters. The story explores the history, the art of Kung Fu and asks important questions about how the cultural heritage can be kept alive in a world that prefers to forget about its origins. The sadness and tragedy conveyed in the personal stories and anecdotes of today's last surviving traditional Kung Fu masters, along with the majesty and beauty of their skills, serve as reminders of the frailty of even the deadliest of arts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392227</url></doc>
