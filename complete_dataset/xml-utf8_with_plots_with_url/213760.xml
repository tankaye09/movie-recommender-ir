<plot>Jenna is strong willed; she never blinks at adversity. But she has one slight problem. She can't talk to guys. When she likes a guy, she turns into a jibbering idiot. Her friends, the na√Øve Angie and the foul-mouthed artist Mouse, decide to help her out. As Mouse never does anything small in scale, she concocts a plan to kidnap the object of Jenna's desire so that Jenna can have a chance to express her feelings to a captive audience. To help in this "brilliant" plan, Angie recruits Tommy and Alloy, two well-meaning morons who seem to share a brain. Together they embark on a mission to prove that sometimes true love just needs a little helping hand... or a sock full of quarters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213760</url></doc>
