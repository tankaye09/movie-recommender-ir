<plot>All Brian wants to do is get his weather readings from the roof and get them to the news room. However when he gets to the roof he finds that he is not alone up there. He finds the Jumper. A woman that has had enough with life and wants to end it all. Only one man can save her, but it isn't Brian. He doesn't care because if those weather readings aren't on the new desk soon he will be out of a job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567789</url></doc>
