<plot>Beautiful Henna Khan lives the life of a gypsy near the river, Jhelum, in Pakistan with her widowed dad, Khan Baba; three brothers, Ashraf, Razzak, and Zaman; and Razzak's wife, Najma. One day she comes across a male body that has been washed ashore. Khan Baba, Bibi Gul, and Henna take this male in, nurse him back to health, only to find out that he has lost his memory. The male in his sleep cries out the name of "Chand", and everyone starts calling him by that name. Soon he is well enough to walk around and starts working for Bibi and helping her make clay pots. Henna falls in love with him and would like to marry him, much to the chagrin of Daroga Shahbaaz Khan, who has already been married twice, but according to Shariat Law can marry twice more. Khan Baba arranges the marriage of Henna and Chand and a day is set for the marriage. The tribe will soon find out that Chand is not a Muslim, neither is he from Pakistan, but will soon confess to the Daroga that he is a Hindu, an Indian sent by the Indian Government to spy on the Pakistanis. Watch as events unfold and the impact this betrayal has on Henna and her people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235539</url></doc>
