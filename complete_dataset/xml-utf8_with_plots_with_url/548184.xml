<plot>From ShadowScreen Productions comes the second short film by Director Ryan Travis. The Chase is a high octane ride through the gritty urban landscape of Hamburg, Germany. The ride begins in a barren warehouse, where the Thief, played by Beau Clark delivers high end merchandise to his underworld client. The underworld client, or Boss, played by Kevin Scott Allen closely examines the sleek curves of the stolen BMW 1200 GS motorcycle and inspects for faults. The Boss' inquiry takes the audience back in time, through flashbacks, to reveal the death defying stunts carried out by the Thief to attain such a prized possession. With the sounds of shattering glass and whizzing bullets still languishing in his memory the Thief collects his cash and leaves, promising a superior product.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548184</url></doc>
