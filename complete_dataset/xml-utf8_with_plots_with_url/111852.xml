<plot>"Shows Curtis and Gordon in one of their cleverest acts. Miss Belle Gordon holds the Police Gazette medal as Champion Lady Bag Puncher of the World. The bout is a combination of popular leads and blows used by all pugilists, and the grace and ease with which Miss Gordon does a cross-under or throws an upper-cut or an under-cut at Billy Curtis, is so quick and clever that one wishes the round was three times longer. From the handshake to the finish it is refined, scientific and a genuine comedy. Belle is as frisky a little lady as ever donned a boxing outfit, and her abbreviated skirts, short sleeves and low necked waist make a very jaunty costume. Plenty of action and sure to be a great favorite."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111852</url></doc>
