<plot>Sam Denton is trying to repair his marriage with his wife Emily Denton. When Cindy, a strange woman who shows up in Bridgeville claiming to be from another planet, Demison, comes into his office asking for help she seems to be too "far out" for him. But Sam is soon drawn to away from his wife and into Cindy's world which includes a "mission" to find a cyborg from planet Demison. The cyborg, William, accidentally walks into the apartment of Molly Bowers, a local widow. Molly falls in love with the Cyborg from Demison. After William finishes his mission he asks Molly to go with him. But he doesn't live long enough to take Molly back with him. Cindy finds out that William is deviating from the mission and eliminates him. A documentary filmmaker interviews the characters to try and understand them. Also, Megan, a new resident of Bridgeville, keeps a film diary on the strange happenings in the community.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037172</url></doc>
