<plot>'Spirit of Television' took us on a 60 minute trip each week to TV's golden age. Each week, the show featured one (sometimes 2) episodes of a different classic TV Series from TV's black and White era. Host Gene Lowry (Later Michael White) would introduce the shows but provide us with little known facts and trivia. Many of the commercials during the 60 minute show were original commercials that would have aired during that specific show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510642</url></doc>
