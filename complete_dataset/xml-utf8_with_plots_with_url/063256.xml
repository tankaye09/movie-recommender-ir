<plot>One in four kinds of animal on earth is a beetle! No other creatures begin to match their diversity, range of size, color or form. They are built like tanks, have weapons to match, yet can still fly; but as biologists like Tom Eisner reveal, chemistry is the true secret of beetle success. In reality, they are truly remarkable and intriguing creatures. The fact that they are yielding highly promising new medicines proves a powerful reason to conserve their species and their rainforest homes. This film starts off with a little science fiction humor; however, it goes on to portray the remarkable diversity of species and their adaptations. Their chemical defense systems, modes of communication and reproduction, and aspects of mate competition are excellently captured via close-up and time-lapse photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063256</url></doc>
