<plot>Todd and Sue, a couple comfortable with themselves and their two year relationship, go to a restaurant to have lunch. Ordering lunch isn't always as easy as it seems. The simple question "what are you going to get?", begins the unraveling of unspoken issues. As the debate on what to order progresses, so does the insecurity of their relationship. Ultimately, it's never about the burger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546598</url></doc>
