<plot>Goldilocks has been a naughty girl! A very naughty girl indeed! Exceeding her usual transgressions in petty substance abuse and street-working, she is now wanted for breaking and entering and hate-crimes against bears. Dealing with the police is one thing... but when equal opportunity regulations declare that bears must now be employed on the force, it's not only the fuzz that she must deal with... but the paws and claws too! Everyone has a cross to bear... and hers is a cross bear!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219156</url></doc>
