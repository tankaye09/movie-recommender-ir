In "Death in Venice, CA," a stressed-out academic succumbs to the temptations of his landlady's 17-year old step-son. "Achilles" tells the story of Achilles and Patroclus during the siege of Troy. Pride costs Achilles the love of his life. In "My Polish Waiter," a chatty young man, Timith, pushes himself upon Belky, a nearly-wordless immigrant waiter. After they become lovers, Timith sees beyond himself to Belky's happiness. In "Miguel, Ma Belle," a needy, HIV-positive young man gets a dog as a gift when he's jilted.
