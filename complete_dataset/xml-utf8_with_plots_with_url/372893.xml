<plot>Throughout history, mental health conditions have carried with them tremendous stigma born of fear and misunderstanding. Those negative impressions persist today. People living with mental health conditions continue to deal with prejudices that are often more harmful than the symptoms of the conditions themselves. And, with treatment and recovery not only possible but probable, the question begs to be asked, why do the stereotypes continue? Why do those with mental illness continue to be feared, discriminated against, and thus discouraged from openly seeking help? And, in the worst of all cases, why are hundreds of thousands with mental illness being siphoned through our jail system with little hope of being provided quality care and realizing recovery? These are the compelling themes this film highlights with the hope of broadening awareness, encouraging education, and stimulating further discussion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372893</url></doc>
