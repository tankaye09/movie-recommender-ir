<plot>The Rick James Story comes to the screen with all same unstoppable energy and outrageous humor that made him famous. It's a non-apologetic celebration of the man and his music. The songs drive the journey, with many never before heard tracks and Rick's hits like "Give It To Me Baby," "Mary Jane." "Party All The Time" and "Superfreak." The documentary is told by the people who knew him, partied with him and slept with him --from club owners in Buffalo to Hollywood's biggest celebrities. But there's a twist. Rick narrates his own life story. From existing on camera footage Rick literally appears in the film, providing his uncensored opinions and commentary. Quotes from magazine and newspaper interviews are his narrative voice. So when Supermodel, Janice Dickinson, claims to be the inspiration for "Superfreak," we'll give you Rick's take on what really happened that night at Studio 54. "Cocaine is a hell of a drug!" This is an autobiographical chronicle from the grave.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254981</url></doc>
