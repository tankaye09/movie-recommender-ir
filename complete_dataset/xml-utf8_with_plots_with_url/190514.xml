<plot>Unfortunately pretty much based on a true story, "Fat, Broke &amp; Horny" tells the story of one big man's struggle with the small time. Mark, our hero, gets kicked out of his apartment, attacked by a customer at work, attacked by his lover at home, dismissed by his agent, kicked out of Overeater's Anonymous and fired by an executive, all in the course of a lousy couple of days. Oh yeah, he also makes sure that his best friend loses his girlfriend of five years. It's a hard life in Hollywood if you're fat, broke, and horny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?190514</url></doc>
