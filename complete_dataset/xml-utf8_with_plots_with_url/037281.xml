<plot>Elephants are, as a rule, intelligent animals, but this one is particularly so. He picks up huge logs of wood, many of them weighing several tons each, and carries them to a certain spot, where he deposits them at the dictation of his master, seated on his back. Exceedingly good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037281</url></doc>
