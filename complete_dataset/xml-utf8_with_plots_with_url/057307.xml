<plot>A mythological about the deity at Tirupati, notorious as India's richest temple shrine. The film featured Pulliah's wife as the consort of 'Lord of the Seven Hills', Venkateswara (Anjaneyulu). The film depicts the life of Shri Venkateswara one of the gods of the Hindu Trinity. He has to return to earth to get married to Padmavati. They have the most lavish wedding in the 3 worlds. Money is borrowed from Kubera, the money lender of the gods. The temple at Tirupati was built in honour of Shri Venkateswara and to this day his devotees are repaying the loan by donations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057307</url></doc>
