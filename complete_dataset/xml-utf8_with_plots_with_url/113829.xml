<plot>"Confessions of a Rat Pack Party Girl" is the poignant, sometimes funny, often tragic and ultimately uplifting tale of Jane Harvey, one of the most successful businesswomen you've never heard of. During the 1960s, Jane was commanding a salary of over half a million dollars a year. Her business; her profession? The oldest in the world. But Jane wasn't a streetwalker or a dime store hooker. Jane serviced a far more elite clientele. Picture Vegas. The 1960s. We're talking movie stars, athletes, musicians. We're talking...the Rat Pack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113829</url></doc>
