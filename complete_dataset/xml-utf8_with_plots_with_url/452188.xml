<plot>Quin fears his own voice, pencils, the way certain things feel to his senses and the way certain things sound. He doesn't shave, shower, brush his hair or teeth. His life has become an eternal handicap. In an effort to one day become normal, Quin goes to see a psychiatrist specializing in the deaf and mute. Quin forms a bond with this psychiatrist by the name of Doctor Murphi, who wants to replace medication with a confrontation of fear through psychological exercises. When the exercises don't seem to help, Quin turns to himself to try to regain his life back, while Doctor Murphi secretly request the help of Quin's wife in a last desperate attempt to save Quin, that ultimately, will bury them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452188</url></doc>
