<plot>The Prodigal Son is a documentary that explores how first-generation migrant parents have struggled to come to terms with their son's sexuality. When Ted came out as gay to his parents, his mother Ljubica insisted it was a passing phase and his father Alexo refused to speak to him. Fifteen years passed, with no communication between father and son, until Alexo discovered he was suffering from a serious illness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584340</url></doc>
