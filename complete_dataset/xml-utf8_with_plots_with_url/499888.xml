<plot>In Norway and Sweden a form of ice sport is introduced which is never seen this side of the Atlantic. Each skater is provided with a small sail, which is secured to his body and manipulated much after the fashion of the sail of a boat. When a good wind is blowing, enormous speed is oftentimes developed. Our picture was secured while a large number of skate sailors were indulging in the sport, and the view is a most excellent and comprehensive one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499888</url></doc>
