<plot>Walter is addicted to scaring people. He has his favorite set-ups and keeps extensive notes on them. Walter's house mate Randall is his latest subject, but the constant scares drive him crazy and he moves out. Things change when Stacy moves in. She seems immune to his scare tactics. It is a challenge Walter has never faced.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401351</url></doc>
