<plot>Ravi Khanna has worked hard to be where he is now - a Judge in Bombay High Court. He had fallen in love with beautiful lawyer Rama, and had married her. His brother, Sumit, is a college student, who has always excelled in sports and studies. Sumit is in love with Anshu, the only daughter of Diwan Pratap Singh, an alliance that is suitable both for the Khannas and the Diwan, and preparations are on for their marriage. Then one day Anshu goes missing. A lengthy search leads to the discovery of her battered and bruised body. Diwan and Sumit are devastated by her death. Anshu's death is followed by the brutal death of five more college students. Police Inspector Khan's investigation leads him to conclude that Sumit Khanna has committed these murders, and he arrests Sumit. But Sumit is quite nonchalant about his arrest, as he knows that the matter is to be tried in his brother's court, and that the lawyer defending him is none other than his bhabhi (sister-in-law) Rama.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?403284</url></doc>
