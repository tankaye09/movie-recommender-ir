<plot>Rock Albertson, a frustrated, middle aged writer spends his days editing other peoples' books at MacGregor House Publishing and his evenings painting landscapes on the advice of his shrink. His days are empty save for his burnt out assistant Jessica and his "fabulous" boyfriend James, a teacher at a local university. After meeting a mysterious stranger on the way to his train Rock begins to question it all, including his sanity. Rock and James find themselves sharing their Midtown apartment with an uninvited houseguest. What if you woke up and found Jesus Christ sitting on your sofa watching a soap opera? And how would you explain it to your Mother?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379581</url></doc>
