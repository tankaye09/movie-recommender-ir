<plot>Alex, an ambitious photographer, is visited by her friend Bernard, who asks her to help him finding his wife, Soon Yin, accused of conspiring against the Burmese regime and who disappeared a month before. Alex accepts helping him because of their friendship, but also because of the professional possibilities of the trip. After finding out some information, she finally finds Soon Yin and they both escape towards the frontier with Pakistan. In the jungle they have to overcome all kinds of difficulties: hunger, fighting against Burmese soldiers, injuries. Finally they meet the Karen guerrillas, an ethnic group who struggles against the regime. But, even if they seemed to be of help in the jungle, the women finally realizes that they have become their prisoners. Alex and Soon Yi have to gamble their freedom on the roulette with Khun Sa, and they win. Unharmed, they will finally be able to leave Burma, and Alex will have a good collection of photographs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?122937</url></doc>
