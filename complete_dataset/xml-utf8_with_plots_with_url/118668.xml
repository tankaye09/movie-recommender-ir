<plot>On the morning of May 2, 2006 a fire broke out in the Greenpoint Terminal Market. The blaze spread so quickly that the Fire Commissioner immediately suspected arson. After the 10 alarm fire was put out the block was shut down as investigators combed the site for evidence. Fourteen firefighters were reported to have suffered minor injuries and no civilians were reported hurt. Crime Scene Greenpoint is a hallucinatory document of this event.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118668</url></doc>
