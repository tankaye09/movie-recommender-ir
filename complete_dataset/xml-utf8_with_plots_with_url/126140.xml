<plot>A mother takes her kids and her boyfriend for a trip white water rafting. Everything is going fine till they find an unconscious body. They wait up for him to wake up till two escaped convicts find them and demand money. They have no clue what they are talking about, so her boyfriend lies to the men and tells them that it is across the river. Also that they know about it because he put it there because he didn't want the police to get it and that he is keeping the family hostage. The men make them cross the river and before they get across they knock the guys out of the boat. Now they must find their way back to safety before they find them. But, is what her boyfriend said true?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126140</url></doc>
