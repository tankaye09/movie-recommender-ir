<plot>Industrialist Norton Simon came to art late in life, never even going to a museum until he was 40. But he brought a rare intensity and a huge bankroll to the task, quickly becoming perhaps the most significant private collector of old masters. More importantly, he opened a museum that closely reflects his taste, since he personally acquired all the works, and it lives on as an impressive collection. We see many of the artworks, while hearing about them and about Simon from the voices of numerous "witnesses."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540866</url></doc>
