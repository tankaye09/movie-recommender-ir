<plot>Two old ladies who never had a chance to go to school because of their gender are now almost 70. For the first time, they are given an opportunity to study arithmetic and Hangul at a community center. Busy taking care of late-in-life children and farming, it's tough for them to attend everyday, but the new experience livens up their lives. Watching how learning gives them joy and energy is not the only thing that is inspiring, but also the earnest manner they have toward their everyday lives as mothers and as women. Listening to the voice of aged women reading their own diaries gives viewers a chance to reflect upon life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082627</url></doc>
