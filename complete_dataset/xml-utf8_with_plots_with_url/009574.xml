<plot>The setting is the comfortable Connecticut home of a well-to-do family. Agnes is a determined, powerful woman who feels she must hold her husband together and present a brave face to the world. Her husband, Tobias, is both retired and retiring, a man who cannot quite face up to life. Living with the couple is Agnes' sister, Claire, an alcoholic who sees through and scoffs at the insincerity and pretensions around her. Clare's outrageous comments are meant as much to reflect her own bitterness as to shake Tobias out of his mute acceptance of Agnes' dominance. They are soon joined by Harry and Edna, a married couple who are Agnes and Tobias' best friends and Agnes and Tobias' spoiled 36-year old daughter, Julia, who returns home from her fourth broken marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009574</url></doc>
