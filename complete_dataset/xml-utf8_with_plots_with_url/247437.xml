<plot>Ashok is a petty thief working under a notorious gangster named Sunder. When Ashok comes across a dead body of a watchman, he reports this matter to the police, much to the anger of some of Sunder's men. Ashok then meets Nimmo, and both fall in love with each other. Nimmo convinces Ashok to give up this life of crime, and begin anew. Ashok agrees, and then when he has not eaten for two or three days, he realizes that it is not that easy to be a honest man. And neither will his former associates let him live very long, nor will they trust their secrets with him as long as he is alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247437</url></doc>
