<plot>Ben, a blind young man who has volunteered to help a group of scientists in the development of their visual simulation for the blind, stumbles through a virtual world as the program becomes inexplicably affected by his subconscious. Every step of the way, his past, and how he lost his vision, chase him down. Or is he chasing his past? Mean while, the three scientists in charge of the program argue about the best course of action, and if Ben should be allowed to wonder though such a constantly altering virtual terrain, where he should be the only person, and yet he claims to have seen someone else. Dangerous or not, the choice is made to allow Ben more time to see if he can identify the anomalies he's seen. To do so, Ben must come face to face with his own inmost deepest pain, because some things never leave us. In a moment of lucidity amidst the madness, the virtual becomes more real than his life outside the simulation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175682</url></doc>
