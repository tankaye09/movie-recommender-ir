<plot>Turd on a String tells the story of the archetypal modern man: depressed, lonely, and alienated; yet with a burning ambition to succeed. One morning he is presented with an unmissable opportunity, which enters his house through the shiny golden letter box. As he chases his potential prize through the wastelands of the modern world, his quest becomes increasingly more desperate and the boundary which separates the edifice of humanity from its core animality is gradually traversed. Slowly, our hero begins to realize that the denial of our nature is what makes us truly human.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621133</url></doc>
