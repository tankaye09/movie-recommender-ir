<plot>Billy and Cindy are teeners trapped in the conflicted world of their parents. Two children of two marriages gone sour. Young and confused by the whole situation, they try to look for answers, but the whole business of life is not as simple as it seems. Left with no choice but to come to terms with whatever it is that life presents, they rely on each other for emotional support. And in the process, they learn that despite their parents marital woes, much remains in life and love reserved for the two of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384643</url></doc>
