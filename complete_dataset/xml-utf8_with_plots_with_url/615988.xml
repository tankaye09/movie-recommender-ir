<plot>Gemskii's start to life, as she explains it, isn't a bad one "I've got a mansion to play in, a stately car to drive in and lots of animals to thrive among...my good dad, he thinks I'm special...He's 'Master of the Hunt.' He's in 'Who's Who.' He's brilliant." But we soon find out all is not as it appears. This true story of the actress's own life is a powerful, soulful and moving one. Filmed at CleanBreak Theatre in London this one woman show takes us on an unimaginable journey through Gemskii's life as she regales her story through words and movement, taking in as she goes, sexual, physical and emotional abuse;drug taking and alcohol; prostitution, self-harm and sexual awakening. Having glimpses of fame as a dancer with Michaela Strachan, Pete Waterman, Goldie, Normsky and David Bowie, discovering she's a Lesbian after a catalogue of abusive male relationships, travelling the world to discover human nature is the same no matter where you are and a stay in an asylum all become part of Gemskii's Transformation and as she say's at the beginning "Every Transformation starts with chaos...so you've been warned."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615988</url></doc>
