<plot>Film examines the origins of oppression in contemporary Belarus, skillfully crafting a condemning indictment of the Belarusian social justice system and of President Alexander Lukashenko's brutal authoritarian regime. Working under constant state surveillance in a country where dissenting journalists and politicians have been kidnapped and killed, Dashuk outlines how Lukashenko brought the legal system and the state under his exclusive control. Dashuk's camera is present when the election commission headquarters of the 2004 referendum are raided by Lukashenko's thugs. Describing his country as a dictatorship where Themis, goddess of justice and morality, has degenerated into a lady of easy virtue seeking her own self interest, Dashuk uses damning evidence show trials against the innocent, the disappearance and destruction of political opponents, the use of brute violence against anyone that opposes the ruling powers to draw a direct line from the methods of Stalin to the rule of Lukashenko.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603415</url></doc>
