<plot>The making of 'A Horse With No Name', a $10,000 film that was made entirely without a script. Each day, the two co-directors would write scenes for the following day to give to the actors, who were told that they would only be given dialogue on the day to 'keep it fresh'. None of the actors in the film knew it was being made without a script. The documentary follows the madness of trying to make a film in this way.</plot><plot>The making of 'A Horse With No Name', a $10,000 film that was made entirely without a script.
