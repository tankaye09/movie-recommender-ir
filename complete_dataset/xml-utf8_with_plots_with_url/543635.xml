<plot>A man in a hat and suit is swimming underwater toward a culvert in a concrete wall. Out on the street, six or seven Hasidic Jews pull guns from their clothes and fire at a manuscript titled "Homeward Bound" that one of them has flung high into the air. The swimmer, without his hat, emerges into a pond; he stands, puts on dark glasses and smoothes his hair. Words by Albert Einstein appear on the screen, "You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother." The credits roll. Is allegory afoot?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?543635</url></doc>
