<plot>Ae-Ryun runs a video store called "Sad Movie" on her own. She is a typical Pisces who likes French films and takes an interest in everyone surrounding her. Her best friends are the movies that surround her--and a lonely tropical fish. One day she meets an unusual customer, Dong-Suk, who comes into her store to rent some videos. He loves French movies too. With his beautiful smile, she cannot help her affection towards him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381178</url></doc>
