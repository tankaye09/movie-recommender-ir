<plot>Robin Dutt (Suresh Oberoi) is in the business of shoooting movies, and has often to come into contact with attractive women. This creates suspicion and doubts in his wife's, Seema Dutt's (Swaroop Sampat) mind, and when she observes lipstick marks on his shirt, she decides to separate from him. Robin is devastated by her decision, but her mother (Dina Pathak) is pleased that she has finally separated from Robin. Robin's attempts to see their son, Bobby, are often in vain due to Seema's mom. He then decides to abduct Bobby in order to be close to his son. A frantic Seema has no choice except to contact the police and report her son missing. How will this resolve their dispute? Or will it deepen their dispute?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?620870</url></doc>
