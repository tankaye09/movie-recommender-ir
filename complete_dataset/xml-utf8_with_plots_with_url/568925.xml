<plot>Miss Hartley is pleased to have found employment with Mrs Brymton as a lady's maid. She is somewhat concerned at having been hired sight unseen, but on her arrival at Brymton Hall she finds both her employer and the other servants in the house to be quite amenable. Mr. Brympton on the other hand is rude and nasty to his wife, but fortunately is frequently away and Mrs Brymton has formed a close friendship with a neighbor, Mr. Ranford. Miss Hartley is shaken however when she sees someone in the house who should not be there. Just who is this person and what is she trying to tell her?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568925</url></doc>
