<plot>"This film represents Christmas morning, as its name implies, showing the delight of the children when they come down in the morning and find the Christmas tree beautifully decorated, besides their presents, which have been placed on the table for them, and they show their surprise and joy, dancing the while in their merriment. Their proud mamma stands by and enjoys to the full the romping and shouts of her children."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104945</url></doc>
