<plot>The year is 1979. A boy from India moves with his family to Ponca City, Oklahoma and finds a hero in Butch, the scruffy tow-truck driver next door. Though an embarrassment to the entire neighborhood, in the boy's innocent eyes, Butch is a matin√©e idol and the father he wishes he had. And it just so happens, Butch's daughter Amy has captured our Indian boy's heart in a way only a first-love can... the girl-next-door couldn't be close enough! Until, seeing their son become too westernized for his own good, the parents send the boy back to India. Over the course of the next two decades, the boy marries the woman his father arranged for him and becomes the doctor his father expected him to be. But twenty years later, when the boy returns to the heartland of America, will his heart land with Amy again?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219968</url></doc>
