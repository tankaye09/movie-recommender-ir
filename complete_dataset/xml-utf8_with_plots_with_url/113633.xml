<plot>In the name of "the struggle against terrorism", a special operation - code named CONDOR - was conducted in the seventies and eighties in South America. Its target were left wing political dissidents, the organised labour and intellectuals. Condor soon became a network of Military Dictatorships, supported by the US State Department, the CIA and Interpol. The film by Rodrigo Vasquez, a young Argentinian director, tells that story by following several victims of Operation Condor fighting for the truth, and by meeting key members of the Condor network themselves who -after 9/11/2001- openly claim being pioneers of the current fight against "international terrorism".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113633</url></doc>
