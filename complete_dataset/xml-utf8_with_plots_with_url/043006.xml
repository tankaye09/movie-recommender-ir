<plot>A sailor leaves the navy with only $2.00 and his dog to his name. He manages to get ahold of a nice English suit and is mistaken for the Prince of Wales by a wealthy old man, who invites the sailor to his home and introduces him to his daughter. The daughter, suspicious of him because she has just been swindled by a phony duke, accuses him of being a fake. The sailor, to prove his good intentions, sets out to track down the crooked "duke" and get back the girl's money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043006</url></doc>
