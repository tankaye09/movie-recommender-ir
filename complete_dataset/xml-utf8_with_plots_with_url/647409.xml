<plot>In the war between the humans of the kingdom of Azeroth, and the orcs from the world rift, the humans succeeded in killing the wizard who brought the orcs to their world. But they could not stop the Horde. In the end, their king was killed, and it fell to Lothar, knight of Azeroth, to take what remained of the people of Azeroth across the Great Sea, to the lands of Lordaeron. They brought with them tales of horror, relating what the monstrous Orcish Horde has done to their homeland. But the Horde would not be content with it's victory over the humans. Pillaging the land, they build great ships, and followed after the humans. Hearing of this, the king of Lordaeron called the races of the world of Azeroth to his side; the dwarves of Khaz Modan, the elves of Quel'thalas, and the armies of Lordaeron. In desperation, they make ready for all out war on the Horde, who approach on the tides of darkness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647409</url></doc>
