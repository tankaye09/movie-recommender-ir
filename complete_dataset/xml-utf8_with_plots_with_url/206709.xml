<plot>Here is one to please the children. A group of bright young girls are each supplied with a plate in each of which the eldest girl pours some water. She seats herself on a chair surrounded by the others and they follow her motions. She places her hand in her dish, rubs it on her face making motions as would suggest a mustache and side whiskers, after which she rubs her hand under the plate, goes through the same motions and is imitated closely by the group. As each one rubs her hand under the plate and then to her face, the plates having been blackened by lamp black prior to the beginning of the game, all but the leader is marked up in such a manner as to create bursts of laughter. After she tires of this game she procures a mirror and shows the group how they have disfigured themselves, when they all take her and give her a dose of her own medicine. This is really funny and the photography is excellent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206709</url></doc>
