<plot>Marco wakes up and goes to work every day, until one day he just can't. Instead, he invents a more exciting reality - one that makes him a pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies. Eventually, Marco's psychiatrist grows tired of this charade, and confronts him. A visit by Marco's ex-girlfriend, Carrie, reminds him that the measure of his life isn't found in his job title or status but in the people who love him. Making a living isn't necessarily living.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608472</url></doc>
