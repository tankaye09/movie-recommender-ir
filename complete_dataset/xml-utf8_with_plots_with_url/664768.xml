<plot>Scrappy's dog, Yippy, isn't feeling well. Scrappy sees a sign for Dr. Woof's Dog Tonic and thinks that's just the thing. But in order to get there, he has to pass through Rough House Alley. To protect his only coin, he puts it in his mouth, accidentally swallowing it; it's jarred loose, only to roll under a lady's skirt, pointedly avoid rolling down a grate, and land in a blind beggar's cup. To remove it, Scrappy whistles, and the eagle on the coin flies out, bringing the coin home. He buys the tonic, then runs into bullies, a cop, and bullies dressed as a cop; the tonic falls into a pond, gets eaten by a duck, and comes out inside an egg (with a separate tiny egg for the cork). Finally, Scrappy gets home, only to break the bottle just outside the dog house. But Yippy is feeling fine now and so are her new puppies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664768</url></doc>
