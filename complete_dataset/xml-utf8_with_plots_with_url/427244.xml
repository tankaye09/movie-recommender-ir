<plot>Alain tests video games. He's married, his wife Pascale loves him, and they have a spirited young daughter. But he's unhappy and wants a change, to what he's not sure. He quits. A job counselor suggests a training program operating bulldozers. They have casual sex; Pascale is unhappy with Alain's unfaithfulness. Alain enrolls in the training program: it's 18 weeks long and some distance from Paris, so he is home only on weekends. (He's a natural at operating bulldozers.) As his relationship with Pascale deteriorates, Alain befriends Manu, a young trainee who loves all things about bulldozers but is hopelessly inept at operating them. This friendship takes hold of Alain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427244</url></doc>
