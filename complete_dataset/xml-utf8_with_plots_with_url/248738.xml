<plot>This farcical short was Jerry Lewis' first film as a director, according to co-scripter Don McGuire. Lewis appeared in dual roles as an American Indian and as an Army recruiting officer. The 16mm film was shot in Lewis' house. Janet Leigh commented, "A lot of us would gather there and make these funny movies. And we would then all go and have dinner, and we would go back and continue our shoot the next day. They were funny and quite wonderful. We just had great fun doing it."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248738</url></doc>
