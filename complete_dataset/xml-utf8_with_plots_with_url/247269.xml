<plot>This expeditionary feature film looks at numerous primates, avians, rodents, insects, reptiles, amphibians, unique plants, and human cultural artifacts, some never before filmed. While stylistically incorporating behind-the-scenes realities of conservation film making itself, the feature is driven by an analysis of representative key critical habitats throughout the world most in need of conservation efforts; of techniques that are working to save the most number of threatened, endangered and vulnerable species and genera; and the future outlooks for numerous regions across the planet where there is a good likelihood that well-tuned science, community conservation, government commitment, and informed philanthropic choices can make all the difference. Rare lemurs, plants, and chameleons in Madagascar; the last few endemic shrub and reptilian species on Easter Island (Chile); extraordinary primates and avifauna in Southeastern Peru; primates verging on extinction in three states of Brazil; some of the rarest and most unique birds, bats, and reptiles on earth across, New Zealand; and subtle as well as flagship species of birds and mammals in California, are all part of this two-hours feature film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247269</url></doc>
