<plot>Lucas' stepfather and mother have been arguing a lot so he decides to help. After some ominous signs from his stepfather, Lucas believes that he stepfather wants his mother to get breast implants. Lucas' first step to solving the problem is to get his friend, Leon, to sell drugs to raise money. After a failed drug deal, Lucas grabs his cousins' adopted Mexican brother and goes door-to-door. After a woman mistakes the boy for being gay and gives them extra money, Lucas goes to a Republican mayor candidate for more money. But Lucas' victory doesn't last long. The brothers beat him up and take the money. Lucas then learns the real troubles of his family and why lying is the wrong way to fix anything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200108</url></doc>
