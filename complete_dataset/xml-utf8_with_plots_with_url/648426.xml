<plot>A look at the advanced water safety techniques taught by the American Red Cross, with comic interludes included of an ancient Roman who attempts to save a drowning man. The Red Cross techniques are demonstrated by a combination of underwater and surface footage, and most demonstrate the defensive posture of the rescuer, who must guard against the terrified victim pulling him or her under. Several of the vignettes include a male in trouble and a female rescuer. The narration, except for the Roman interludes, is straightforward.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648426</url></doc>
