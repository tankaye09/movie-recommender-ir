<plot>A portrait of Al Chandler, a member of the Gros Ventre nation who lives in Glendive, Montana. Although he works in the economic mainstream as a senior technical representative for the Xerox Corporation, Chandler maintains traditional ties by attending powwows with his family. As he travels to a celebration at the Rocky Bay Reservation near Havre, Montana, Chandler reminisces about his life and discusses the importance of these traditional gatherings. Arriving at the powwow site, Chandler sets up a tipi with help from his sons, greets friends and makes elaborate preparation for his part in the "grand entry" ceremony and dance exhibition. For Chandler, this eagerly awaited communal event is a "homecoming" and an opportunity for spiritual renewal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254769</url></doc>
