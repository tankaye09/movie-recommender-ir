<plot>Filmmaker and quirky Jewish actor, Ben Mittleman, discovers he has the genetic heart condition that derailed his father's life. Using video diary and archival family footage, he documents his own raw journey. Ben relentlessly pursues the truth of his ever-changing landscape in therapy, giving grim public exposure to the most private eternal questions. "Dying to Live" reveals a man who previously pushed aside many adult responsibilities in order to pursue his acting career while carving out an enchanting and committed 20-year relationship with Valerie, a beautiful older British heiress. Valerie now battles lung cancer and has just returned after having left him for nine months. With a rare humor and spirit, an unknowingly enlightened man struggles deeper into adulthood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162898</url></doc>
