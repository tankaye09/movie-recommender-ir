<plot>Blind Productions is a fictional production company founded exclusively to make Armed For Glory, a short film shot with a night vision camera in a pitch-black space, starring two actors whom had never met each other before. The film was shot in one continuous 12-minute take. Thirteen people worked separately for Blind Productions during a period of three months. No one was allowed to discuss the nature of their work with anyone else involved. To this day the people involved have not met.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544628</url></doc>
