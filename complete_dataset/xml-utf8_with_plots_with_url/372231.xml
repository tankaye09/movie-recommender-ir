<plot>10 New Zealand women are flown to a luxury hotel in Australia for a beauty contest - or so they believe. Instead they find themselves dumped in the middle of the Australian outback, where they are greeted by Vadim "Outback Jack" Dale. To their horror he tells them that they will each be spending the next nine weeks lodging with a family in the small and remote town of Burra, South Australia (population 1'000). Once there, they must compete in a series of challenges for the title of "Miss Popularity". Each week some of the girls are to be nominated for a public vote before the entire community where they must plead for the townspeople's vote. The losers will find them selves sent home, eventually leaving one of them to be crowned the winner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372231</url></doc>
