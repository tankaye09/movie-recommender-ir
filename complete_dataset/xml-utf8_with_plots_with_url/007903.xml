<plot>Ancient East Indian dances were danced exclusively by Temple whores. An East Indian lady, Rukmini Davi, married into British colonial aristocracy, brought the ancient dance traditions back to life and made them respectable. She established the Kalakshetera dance school in Chennai, India. An environmental activist, she kept the company of many literary luminaries, including Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel prize winner for literature, known by many famous Western poets and also known for his conversations with Albert Einstein. The program commentary weaves the connection between East Indian religion, customs and values, both ancient and new, as well the ties with environmental values and contemporary democratic government in India.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007903</url></doc>
