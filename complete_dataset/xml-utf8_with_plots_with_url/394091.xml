<plot>This lost vintage feature film, 'New Gladiators', was filmed in 1973 &amp; 1974 and was the pet project of Elvis Presley and Ed Parker; finally found, restored and released. The cast of this feature film reads like a 'who's who' of the martial arts. You will see Team USA fight at Wembley Stadium in London, England, and then very next day, fight in Brussels against the very best fighters in Belgium. This is not a 'how-to' video - this entertaining film features a great soundtrack created by David Crosby and Graham Nash, and is narrated by karate legend, Chuck Sullivan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394091</url></doc>
