<plot>While focusing in on several different characters, this film looks at the way their lives are affected by Haru, a free-spirited, kind-hearted youth living on the streets of Tokyo. Haru wanders about in a world of his own making, where he whole-heartedly accepts or rejects the people around him based on their first encounter. While many of those around him care for Haru's well-being, his innocence is unlikely to survive the anger of those he rejects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?507494</url></doc>
