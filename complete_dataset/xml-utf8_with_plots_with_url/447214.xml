<plot>In the year 2055, an evil alien by the name of Rajican attacks Earth, the only remaining place of harmony in our Galaxy. As a consequence, the Earth Federation, a united organization for world peace, commissions Dr. Grumm, one of their leading scientists, to develop effective defense systems. Dr. Grumm heads "The Raven", a secret base in which he trains young kids with powerful psychic abilities to become pilots of huge, mind-controlled robots. Hammer, Calito, Hanna and Sandy, four gifted teenagers, are trained as Earth's last line of defense. But with 5 different Psi-Bots ready for battle, a new pilot must join the team. The newcomer, Jacques, has a hard time fitting in. His enormous, latent Psi-Powers are only surpassed by his ego and so he is constantly fighting with his fellow Ravens and especially Calito, for the position of the Ace pilot and team leader. However, with all of them still learning the ropes, it will take extensive training and many dangerous missions to understand that it takes friendship, passion and courage to be a Psi-Bot pilot.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?447214</url></doc>
