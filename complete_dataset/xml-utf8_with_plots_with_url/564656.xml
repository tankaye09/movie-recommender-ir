<plot>A psychiatrist's wife is gunned down by her husband's crazed patient outside a fine restaurant. In his efforts to debunk the delusions that drove his patient's violent attack, Dr. David Lake encounters and reveals more than meets the eye. Alien abductions, serial hit-and-run murders, missing persons and horrors committed by unknown creatures brings this story into focus, but it is the twisted ending that you won't see coming nor soon forget! Inspired by the real events of the "Phoenix Lights", this story will have you wondering about what might happen when you go to bed tonight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564656</url></doc>
