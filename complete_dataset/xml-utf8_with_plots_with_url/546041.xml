<plot>Success is an indefinable personal and unique experience; a culture that has no governing body. You achieve it and you are in. If you don't remember anything else remember, for every man who has acquired success there is another one actually pursuing it. And in the case of the film The Bridge, pursuing it hysterically. Imagine having no idea what success looks like. Is it possible to wake up each morning with everything imaginable to suggest that you are successful and still be a complete failure? Is it possible to have no education, money, or social status and be well on your way to success? Darnell Smith had it all-a new promotion, a beautiful wife, a home in an exclusive neighborhood in the suburbs, a six figure salary and a luxury vehicle. If only that was what he truly wanted out of life. He is the definition of success-at least from the perspective of Jalen Johnson, a 26 year-old hustler from the city. Jalen has made a career out of mediocrity and has yet to find a suitable career that will leverage his greatest asset-being unaccountable. Facing the biggest challenge of his career and closing a highly sought contract, Darnell must balance the challenge of negotiating the deal with mentoring his undeserving understudy. Watch their ideals of life, love, and family collide as Darnell attempts to transition Jalen from a jobless swindler to businessman. Can this unique opportunity end in success despite tremendous gaps in understanding and a high degree of unfamiliarity? Maybe the bridge is all anyone ever really needs to get beyond unfamiliarity, find ones true self, and pursue his passion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546041</url></doc>
