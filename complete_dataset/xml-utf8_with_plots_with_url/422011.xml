<plot>In this picture we see the South Carolina Building, the Cotton Palace, the Palace of Commerce and the great Auditorium. It also shows the beautiful and artistic arrangement of the grounds and buildings. It is a magnificent piece of architecture and landscape work which is almost impossible to conceive without the aid of the picture, which fully portrays every portion of the grand sweep of our camera from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422011</url></doc>
