<plot>Somewhere Near Kokoda is about the struggle of men in war. It focuses on two Australians pinned down deep in the dense jungle of New Guinea, facing an enemy they cannot see, the Japanese. MAX, a cameraman, sent fresh from home to capture the Australians on film, is left to fend for himself while DAVO finds a way back to the men. But MAX is not alone. Instead he comes face to face with the enemy and the decision to kill for the first time. MAX does not see the enemy that his fellow men despise. And he does not know how to kill? MAX will get his first lesson from the footage of his own camera, but he will have to survive this to ever see it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506215</url></doc>
