<plot>ADDRESSLESS examines the causes and possible solutions for homelessness through interviews with people who are or have been homeless. Individuals from various parts of the US introduce themselves and their unique situations, discuss what led them there and possible solutions which would really help people in this situation. The documentary provides a glimpse into what a homeless person faces and how they survive. A variety of footage in several American cities keeps this documentary colorful, interesting and thought provoking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023406</url></doc>
