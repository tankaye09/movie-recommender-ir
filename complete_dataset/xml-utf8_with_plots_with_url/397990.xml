<plot>Ted, a mime in the golden years of his career, is having trouble attracting an audience. One day, Ted is at his street corner where he preforms and a younger, stronger mime shows up, takes his spot, and attracts the crowd that Ted has been trying to attract. About to hang up his hat, Ted is encouraged by a very dedicated fan (his only fan) to continue and challenge the Burly Mime. Filled with laughs, Silence of the Mimes shows that just because you can't make a sound doesn't mean you can't go out with a bang!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?397990</url></doc>
