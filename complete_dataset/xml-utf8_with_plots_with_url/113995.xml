<plot>Alexander Ebberley's controversial first and only book, Confusion and Ignorance; A history of the Bailey family has been rediscovered and is now being hailed as a true American classic since it's original thirty year publication but in that time the author's personal life has taken a terrible downward spiral. Wrecked marriages, self loathing and accusations of murder have left him embittered and cynical. Thrust upon the public by his New York publisher to give his first public appearance in three decades, the author's struggle with his creative genius is reveled in a personal journey of shame and denial to a final recognition of a greater truth; the importance of love, life and the pursuit of happiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113995</url></doc>
