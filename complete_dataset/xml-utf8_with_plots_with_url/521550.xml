<plot>Dec 27 at 9pm ET -- CTV Documentary Explores Universal Truths About Life on the Job - Sunday Night shines a light on working life - from the tortuous, to the tedious, to the touching Sunday night can be a fretful ritual for working people - an anxious exercise in personal score keeping and manic internal monologues. This is where the idle hours of the weekend turn to an unsettling restless worry. On Monday, December 27 at 9 p.m. ET (check local listings) CTV examines that experience in a CTV original documentary, Sunday Night. "What is it about office life that gives you that anxious feeling in the pit of your stomach every Sunday Night?" asked producer Scott Harper. "That was the basic question behind this project. We wanted to explore some of those 'Seinfeld' aspects of working life; office politics, cliques and gossip, climbing the corporate ladder and of course, surviving the dreaded performance review." It can all add up to a worrisome state of mind that descends on our collective psyche every Sunday night like a recurring dream. As though set to some mental alarm clock, our mindset quickly jolts out of relax mode and into work mode. Shot over the course of a year in a downtown Toronto temp agency, this is the story of a year in the life of an office. The cast is drawn from a list of familiar characters - the malcontent, the imposter, the omniscient secretary, the golden boy, the yes-man, and so on. Sunday Night captures their day-to-day working lives, putting a familiar face on the end-of-weekend woes and taking viewers on a playful and touching journey into the bizarre world of contemporary corporate culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521550</url></doc>
