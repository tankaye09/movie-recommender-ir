<plot>This DVD is filled with brilliant artistry and offbeat stories reflecting Leo Kottke's unique view of the world. This previously unavailable sold-out 1988 performance at Toronto's Bathhurst St. Theater has been restored to feature Leo's entire performance, showcasing his masterful six-string, twelve-string, and slide guitar work. It also features Leo's life on the road including previously unseen footage of Leo playing with the late Michael Hedges backstage in Nashville, and a nearby extended performance with Chet Atkins and Doc Watson at a photo shoot. On location in Minnesota, Leo takes us on a tour of some of his favorite spots around the house and the property. Directed by Mary Perillo.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329345</url></doc>
