<plot>Bonnie Jean Foreshaw was sentenced to the longest prison term of any woman in the state of Connecticut in 1986. She was the first person to shoot and kill a pregnant woman, which she did in self defense against a man. This man, Hector Freeman, testified to pulling the women in front of him, and using her as a shield. Pro life groups campaigned to charge her with double murder for the death of the fetus. After a one day trial, during which many of her rights were violated, Bonnie was sent to prison, where she still sits today. She has been a hero and leader, a mother to the inmates, this is her story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578567</url></doc>
