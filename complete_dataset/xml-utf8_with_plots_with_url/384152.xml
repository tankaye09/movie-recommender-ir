<plot>Will Yapp grew up watching Bruce Forsyth on television and jumps at the chance to spend some time with him reminiscing about his career. To help the two of them hit it off and get chatting, the BBC pays for Bruce, his wife and the film crew to go on holiday to an island off the coast of Hong Kong, where his wife is designing the costumes for the swimwear section of the Miss World contest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384152</url></doc>
