<plot>Princess Mati took her new husband, Mark, and a camera crew to Burning Man, an annual art festival in the high desert of Nevada attended by thousands. The idea was to capture the enlightening experience of radical self-expression and share it with the world, but they never returned. The unlabeled footage was eventually found and the story of what happened was pieced together, but any information about their current whereabouts would still be greatly appreciated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067434</url></doc>
