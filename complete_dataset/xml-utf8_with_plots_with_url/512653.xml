<plot>Sam is a tree-hugging, veggie-eating, mustache-sporting, nature photographer who's stuck in the 80's. That is until his father is violently killed right in front of him. Sam quickly finds out his dad wasn't the mild-mannered documentary filmmaker he thought he was, but rather that it was a cover for his real job as a world-traveling assassin for a secret government organization. Sam decides to take justice into his own hands and find his father's killer. STACHE is the story of one man's journey from zero to hero, with a good bit of blood, guts, and facial hair along the way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?512653</url></doc>
