<plot>Two-time Emmy Award winning actress Jess Walton (The Young and the Restless) stars as a woman who, on the surface, has a model life. Margaret Rose has three children, a husband who loves her, and is very comfortable financially. She should be happy, but all she really thinks about is finding a way out. Having no friends and knowing that she cannot share her helplessness with her husband, she turns to the things that comfort her the most... The brown paper bags who ride home from the market with her each day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422459</url></doc>
