<plot>The Professor, who is a renowned magician, hears some one approaching and instantly changes himself into a cloaked figure with a skull head. Two burglars enter and deal him a terrible blow on the head. One of the burglars now fills his sack. Suddenly the bag changes into the Professor, who springs to the floor, and as he alights changes again into a bag before their astonished eyes. The Professor makes another lightning change and then vanishes himself. Very startling and laughable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248416</url></doc>
