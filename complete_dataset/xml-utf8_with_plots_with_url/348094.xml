<plot>Larry O'Reilly, a quadriplegic in his early sixties, lies confined to his hospital bed next to a hospital room window. When Larry's new hospital mate arrives, the morally confused David Ackerman, Larry takes it upon him self to instill in David a new perspective of living life by telling him about the current events taking place outside the window each day. Tensions build between the two hospital mates and Larry realizes he has only a short time to make David realize this new self-awakening. A catastrophic event suddenly occurs leaving it up to David to make a critical decision. Will Larry's goal to change David have an impact on David's critical decision, or did David miss his opportunity to learn a valuable lesson in life?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?348094</url></doc>
