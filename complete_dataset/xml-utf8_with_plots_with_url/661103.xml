<plot>Sportscaster Bill Stern drops in at the bowling alley---before they went uptown and became bowling lanes--- and exchanges some commentary with bowling pros Ned Day and Joe "The Fabulous" Felcaro. Ned and "Fabulous" then put on an exhibition of the skills that made both tops in their field at the time. This will make Felcaro's 2nd film listing on the IMDb, along with a Ted Husing sports short made in 1934, but he was in a dozen or more between these two. Actually, this makes his 3rd IMDb listing. He was also known as Joey Felcaro and there is a listing for him under that name. When Stern showed up at a sport played indoors(bowling, badminton, ping-pong, wood whittlin' and such), that usually meant the water skiers had retired for the winter in Florida, which is where Stern and Columbia cranked out scores of sports shorts. Columbia production number 9803 on this one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661103</url></doc>
