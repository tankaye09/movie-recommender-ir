<plot>The programme follows the development of cultural, religious and scientific attitudes to masturbation, from the masturbatory creation myths of the Ancient Egyptians and the dildo as luxury item in Ancient Greek society to the efforts of the Christian church to stigmatise masturbation. Contributors discuss the collaboration of religious fervour and medical concern which culminated in the 19 century battle with 'self-abuse', the contribution to the deconstruction of the taboo made by academics including Freud and Kinsey and the importance of masturbation in the female sexual liberation of the 60s. The embarrassment that still surrounds wanking is highlighted by examples of the use of humour in depictions of solo sex in contemporary cinema and those involved in the sex industry describe how technology and the internet have generated new approaches to an old sexual practice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564567</url></doc>
