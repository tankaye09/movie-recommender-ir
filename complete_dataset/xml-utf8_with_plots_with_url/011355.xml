<plot>In 1963, the first US quintuplets to survive were born in Aberdeen, South Dakota. We meet the Fischers - the babies' parents - two weeks after the babies' birth; we see the physician and each infant. Then, we meet their several older siblings, see some of the donated items, watch dad take his older children around the farm in his Model T Ford, and follow mom on a shopping trip. The family discusses keeping the quints' lives away from the spotlight, and the city fathers talk about commercial possibilities. The film ends with a town dinner, speeches, and a parade to mark the quints' first month of life. The school band, the parents in a convertible, and then a sudden rain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011355</url></doc>
