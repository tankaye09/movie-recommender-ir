<plot>A sorrowful night-in-the-life of a man in the modern urban jungle. A man in a dark suit and dark hat - who looks like an emaciated Fred Astaire - arrives home late at night and crawls into bed next to his sleeping wife. His sleep is restless, and soon he has the night sweats. Then, a dripping faucet, barking dogs, and his wife's snores make sleep impossible. He gets up; hallucinations start, plus a real nightmare. When the alarm clock rings in the morning, a different kind of nightmare begins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396058</url></doc>
