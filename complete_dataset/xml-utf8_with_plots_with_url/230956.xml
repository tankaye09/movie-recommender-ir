<plot>Once at the top of the heap, former Bay Street lawyer Harry Wolfe now scrapes out a living as an unregistered private investigator. A dis-barred loser in everyone's eyes, Harry clings to the shred of hope that he'll prove his law partners set him up to take the fall that destroyed his life. He is joined by Adam, a young Native Canadian who has come to Toronto in search for his missing sister. They develop a bond of trust and together uncover corruption in high places.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230956</url></doc>
