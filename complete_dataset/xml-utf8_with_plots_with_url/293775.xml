<plot>More injuries occur in the kitchen than in any other part of the home and every year thousands get sick from what's growing - or living - in their kitchen. Health Inspector Rob Mancini and Interior Designer Marina Hildebrand have a mission -to discover the dangers that can put a family at risk in an everyday kitchen. From fire hazards to insect infestations, Rob and Marina are on the case. After a careful inspection of the "crime scene" using today's latest technology, they "interrogate" the suspects and use surveillance cameras to gather more evidence. They take their findings to the Forensics Lab and determine what's really lurking in the fridge or behind cupboard doors. Finally, the family is confronted with the verdict and the shocking state of their home. To solve these crimes, Rob and Marina spend $5000 to clean up and renovate the kitchen. They reveal the new kitchen and provide sage advice to the family and the viewers on how to maintain a cleaner, safer and better functioning kitchen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?293775</url></doc>
