<plot>This feature length high definition documentary follows one of the Nation's most controversial yet progressive leaders, Former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson. In post-modern verite style, "Blue Man / Red State" captures Mayor Anderson during his last year in office and then on to his founding of "High Road for Human Rights". In following the social action of this Mayor "Blue Man/Red State reveals how our democracy, although fragile, is finally becoming more than an experiment against eons of autocracy. In fact, it may actually work. Called "America's Mayor" by filmmaker Michael Moore, "America's Newest Folk Hero" by The Nation Magazine, and a "kook" by Fox Network's Bill O'Reilly, Utahns just call him "Rocky." No matter what you call him, Rocky Anderson is worth watching. Rocky's frustration with the political logjam created by National Politicians' failure to act on the crucial issues of our time has led him to take the lead. Seeking out activist National and International leaders he has formed coalitions for work on Global Warming, Equal Rights, Reformative Justice, Immigration Reform, the Iraq War and most importantly the preservation of the Constitution of the United States. "Blue Man/Red State" reveals through Rocky Anderson's journey that it is not too late to be "We, the People, of the United States of America."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076410</url></doc>
