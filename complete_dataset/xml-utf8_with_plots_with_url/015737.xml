<plot>It's 2004. There is no Hockey. What's a family to do? A Man and his Boy sit in silence, with nothing to talk about. So the Man decides to build a Flea Circus. It's wonderful, and loads of fun. The Man and Boy spend hours playing with it. They decide to take it outside. The Neighbors see it... and since they don't have Hockey either.. they stay to watch. The Man realizes that he can make a quick buck. He starts charging for tickets.. Then over-charging for tickets and scheduling more and more shows.. Soon he gets so busy, that he starts ignoring the Boy. The Boy comes up with a plan of sabotage. He places an "On Strike" sign on the Circus and scares everyone away.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015737</url></doc>
