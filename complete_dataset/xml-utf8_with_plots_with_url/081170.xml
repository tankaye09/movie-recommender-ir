<plot>In 2005, Boybrand stepped out of obscurity and onto the Asian pop music charts. Their meteoric rise and subsequent fall was documented in this tale of redemption and debauchery. Based out of Taiwan, their Taiwanese producer, George Wong turned them into an Asian mega-band in a matter of months, only to see them succumb to violence, drugs and deviant sexual behavior. At least, that's what the media reported. This is the story of what really happened. What makes this boy band special is they're all expatriates living in Asia. Their sudden success and lack of experience dealing with music executives leaves them open to kinds of exploitation rarely seen in the Western world. They don't even have agents. Through emotional interviews, security footage and hidden cameras, the real story of what happened to the Boybrand is brought to light by intrepid personality, Jack Stage. Jack was originally hired to produce a reality TV show based on the band before they fell apart - and before their producer fled the country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081170</url></doc>
