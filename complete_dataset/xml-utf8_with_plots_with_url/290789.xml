<plot>Classic rally-cross assault course show for motorbikes. Kick-start was a staple of school holiday morning TV schedules in the UK throughout the 1980's. Was probably best known for the sight of men on motorbikes driving over (or often falling off) a battered VW beetle. It also had a well loved theme tune and even a fantastic spin-off computer game for the Commodore C16.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290789</url></doc>
