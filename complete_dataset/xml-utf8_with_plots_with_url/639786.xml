<plot>"Vidas Perdidas - Lost Lives" is a short film which aims to take a realistic look at the circumstances of undocumented Mexican immigrants when they decide to cross the border into the United States. Something new of this short film is that is from the point of view of a Border Patrol Agent, who has a Mexican background. Officer Cervantes is an Mexican-American border patrol who works in El Centro, California. One normal day he finds Carlos, an illegal Mexican who he had already caught twice. This immigrant dares to insult Officer Cervantes calling him "pocho", a Mexican who has been born in USA. Furious, Officer Cervantes accuses Carlos of being a coyote, someone who smuggles other Mexicans for money, and who usually leaves them die in the desert. But not everything is what it seems. Through flashback Carlos relates a harrowing tale of betrayal and death which can be understood from a variety of perspectives regardless what country a viewer might come from.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?639786</url></doc>
