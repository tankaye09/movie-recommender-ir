<plot>Maya is a single woman, approaching 30. Her intrusive mother sets her up with a doctor and sends her money every week to use on therapy. The date with the doc is a bust, but Maya gets an idea: instead of using mom's money on therapy, why not take dance lessons? There she meets Sascha, a terrific dancer with a winsome, open spirit.
