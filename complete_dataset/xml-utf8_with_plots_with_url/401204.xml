<plot>Originally written and shot as a sketch for a show at a theatre here in Atlanta, Not Without My Hitler is a short PARODY of the Lifetime movies, a la "Not Without My Daughter," et al. A couple, Barb and Stan, are moving soon. The problem is Barb has found that Hitler has been living in her basement, unbeknownst to Stan. Does she leave him there, or take him with them. Maybe her neighbor, Nan, will brew up a solution along with a delicious pot of her signature flavored coffee.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401204</url></doc>
