<plot>In New England circa 1933, a niece is reported missing and presumed dead and Cabot Barr (George Arliss) summons his relatives to the family estate for a memorial service. Once there, Barr taunts each one, claiming their only interest in him is hsi money, and sends them away when the report about the niece proves to be false. Only niece Marjorie, who has ridiculed one of his pet eccentricities, seems to be the object of any sentimental affection. Weeks later, Marjorie and her mother, Augusta (Edna May Oliver) and Allan (Frank Albertson), a young man Barr admires, are invited to Barr manor, where Barr fosters a romance between Marjorie and Allan. When his son, Judd (Donald Meek), seeks to have him declared insane, the shock kills the old man. Again, the family is gathered, a curtain is drawn and the old man appears on a film, and he tells each relative what he is leaving them and why, or why not in the case of Judd who is cut off without a cent. Marjorie is left the bulk of the estate as the old man, on film, declares her to be the only one worthy of carrying on the Barr traditions, and Allan is instructed to marry her and take her name as his family's cognomen. The film and the film within ends with Barr announcing that he hopes to have the pleasure of meeting them all again in another world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569433</url></doc>
