<plot>It is the year 1857 in India, a year that Sardar Ajit Singh, his wife, their children, including son, Bhagat, and their parents will never forget, for it was the day his brother, Kishan, sang out against the British, was arrested, escaped from prison, &amp; has never been heard of again. This does have an impact on young Bhagat Singh's mind, so much so that when he grows up he joins the freedom fighting movement, being headed by Chandrashekar Azad. It is then that an unarmed freedom fighter, protesting the Simon Commission, is killed by Police. Bhagat, Chandrashekar, Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, and Jaygopal avenge this death by killing the Assistant of Commissioner Saunders. When a major police hunt is announced, they flee, especially Bhagat, as he has been identified as the Sikh with the turban. Bhagat takes off his turban, shaves off his beard, and continues to be active in the freedom movement. A historical meeting at Tughlak Fort is organized and all freedom fighters from every corner of India are invited so as to consolidate their efforts to force the British to leave India. Then the British decide to implement the Public Safety Bill, which Bhagat and Bhatukeshwar Dutta protest against, in a first-ever scene shot in Parliament House in Delhi, where they explode a bomb, and shout slogans of "Inquilaab Zindabad". They are arrested, charged, and produced before the Courts. A charade of lies follows, and even after the truth surfaces, the two are sentenced to life in prison. Then things take a turn for the worse when Jaygopal becomes a Police informer, leading the police to arrest Sukhdev, Shivram, and also re-arrest Bhagat for their hand in killing Saunder's Assistant, and this time the British are not looking at any life imprisonment sentence - they want to publicly hang the three stalwarts!! Contrary to the well-known fair-mindedness of the British (Not good Cricket, you know), a trial takes place in total absentia, in secret, where even the defendants are not permitted to take part, and it is shortly thereafter on October 7, 1930 that our three heroes are sentenced to be hanged. The day of their deaths is scheduled to be March 24, 1931, but due to crowd unrest, the British decide to by-pass the Court's orders and hang the trio on March 23, 1931. Watch what happens when the news hits the prison and the impact this has on the trio, the rest of the prisoners, &amp; their respective families'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490046</url></doc>
