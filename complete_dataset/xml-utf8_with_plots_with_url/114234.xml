<plot>Conscious Life is a silent film which portrays the pain and delirium of love and tragedy. The short is presented as black and white, set in the late 1920s. The film shows a young photographer in his studio, haunted by the obsession of an unrequited love, and ensuing indifference towards his current lover. Waking from sleep in a dream-like sequence, his photograph on the wall and reality confuse their roles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114234</url></doc>
