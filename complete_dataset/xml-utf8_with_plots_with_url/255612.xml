<plot>A short film which explores Rancho La Brea, one of the world's most famous fossil sites. Located in the heart of Los Angeles, the La Brea Tar Pits is home to over three million fossils from the last Ice Age. It was here that huge mammoths, fierce saber-toothed cats, and giant ground sloths became trapped and entombed in the asphalt that has been seeping out of the ground for the past 40,000 years. This film, which runs on a loop at the Page Museum, explores how these "tar pits" formed, what types of plants and animals became trapped, and how scientists have used these fossil deposits to open a window into the world of prehistoric Los Angeles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255612</url></doc>
