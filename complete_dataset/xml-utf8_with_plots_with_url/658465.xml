<plot>A true story that never happened. According to the press release, Winterland is a film. But in reality, it is a (egomaniac?) portrait of it's creator, Dick Tuinder, who stands to loose control over his project. When his actors mysteriously disappear from the set, he has to tap into all his resources to conjure everything back: walking trees, talking stones, flying eyes, a wall that seperates the real from the virtual world, just to mention a few ingredients of the magic potion. And Sally Dewinter. An eleven year old animated figure who has become lost in 3-D. Her only travel companion is a suitcase. Whatever is in the suitcase is a secret. Such a big secret, that even the girl doesn't know. Sally: "It's the best kept secret in the world." In the end, all will end well. How the plot unravels is not important. For according to the press release, Winterland is a film in which everything what you have seen is really true, but never happened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658465</url></doc>
