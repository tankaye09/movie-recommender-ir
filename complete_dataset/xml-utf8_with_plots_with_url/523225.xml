Robert, the owner of a surf shop, a nice guy who keeps the gang together and enjoys his life in shorts and thongs, is planning a party for the night and start to call his friends. But before the guys are going to shake the bottles, they want to ride some waves and wake so the living dead aka captain James Cook, surf legend Duke Kahanamoku and the Nazi lieutenant Fuhrer Adolf. They were once taken by the ocean forces and damned by Davy Jones to an eternal life on land.
