<plot>Uruguay, South America. October 2004. For the first time, the political party "Frente Amplio" is on the verge of winning the presidential elections. Seregni, one of the founders of this political party, since 1971 fought for that possibility. For ten years he had been in prison for his ideals. His wife and family were silent observers of this long trip to build democracy. This documentary is about that day, together with Seregni's wife, daughter and grand-daughters from the moment the votes were cast up to the results that same night. Seregni has been dead three months before now.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577448</url></doc>
