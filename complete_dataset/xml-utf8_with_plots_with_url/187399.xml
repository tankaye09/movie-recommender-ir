<plot>Brian Rubinstein is the Chief Pediatric Otolaryngology of Head and Neck Surgery, Facial Plastics and Reconstructive Surgery at Kaiser Permanente in Sacramento California. Last year, he started Faces of Tomorrow, a non-profit organization that specializes in facial reconstructive surgery for children in developing countries. Brian formed a top-notch team of compassionate and caring medical professionals with extensive experience in mission work. January 2009, this group of surgeons, nurses, dentists, social workers, speech pathologists, etc., made their first mission trip to Quito, Ecuador as Faces of Tomorrow. In just 10 days, they performed over 55 surgeries for cleft lip, cleft palate, reconstructive rhinoplasty, etc. Every single surgery was a success and at no charge to the families. The schedule was rigorous, 12-14 hour days. And most patients were infants, making it a very sensitive orchestration. Faces of Tomorrow also provides all their own medical supplies and raises all the funds to perform these operations for free. These families were truly grateful for the work this organization provides. Mothers, fathers, grandparents in tears, offering heartfelt hugs and inspiring blessings. Faces of Tomorrow not only repairs faces, they bring hope, happiness, and a new beginning to so many families in need.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187399</url></doc>
