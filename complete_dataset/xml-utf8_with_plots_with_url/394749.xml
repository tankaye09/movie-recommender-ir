<plot>In 1948 during the Greek civil war, 28 thousand children, Greek and Macedonian, were taken from their villages by the communist-led Democratic Army and raised in orphanages in Eastern Europe. The Greeks never allowed the Macedonian children back. In this moving film, 50 years later the 'children' mark the anniversary of their journey. They dance and sing and yearn for their lost villages. The Greek civil war has faded into history, but the Macedonian 'children' remain its forgotten victims.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394749</url></doc>
