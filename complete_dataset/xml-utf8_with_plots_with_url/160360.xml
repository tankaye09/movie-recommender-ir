<plot>After the death of his grandmother, Carl decides to spend his summer with his grandfather. Far from what he knows, he finds himself having trouble relating to his grandfather and even his girlfriend back home. One day, in order to clear his mind and get away for a while, he borrows his grandfather's car to explore the town. In a local theater, his interest is piqued by an attractive woman who mysteriously arrives late to the showing. When she leaves early, his curiosity and imagination get the better of him and he follows her out. Watching and observing her movements from place to place, he begins to see her as a solution to his growing detachment from others. Eventually, gathering together his courage, he decides to approach her in a caf√©. A decision that does much to resolve the issues Carl has been struggling with, although not in the way he imagined. "Driving Around, Following Strangers" was awarded the "Roll Camera" grant from Seattle's Northwest Film Forum.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160360</url></doc>
