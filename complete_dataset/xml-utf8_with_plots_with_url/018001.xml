<plot>Bruce Lucas's art-house favorite is about Katie (Tertia Lynch), a girl who is utterly lost. The man whom she loved deeply and trusted completely has forsaken her and abandoned her at the most vulnerable time in her life. Everything that supported her reality has been taken away and she has lost all will to live. How many times has she gotten to this point where she is ready to take her life? Then Katie is confronted by Nick (Mike McGlone), a beautiful soul who reaches out to her. She lets herself go, falling into his affection and charm. But the ground she walks on is shaky. When Nick doesn't show, she snaps. She falls back into despair. She sits on her bedroom floor with a revolver in her hands. When Nick's favorite song starts to play in her mind, Katie recalls how Nick made her feel. She is determined to feel that way again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018001</url></doc>
