<plot>Patricia St John's warm story about Philip and Ruth in 1940s England. They have set their hearts on a second-hand camera, which will greatly increase the quality of their nature study notes. The only way they can raise the money is by dressing up as Gypsy flower sellers. Discovered by their gaurdian, Aunt Margret, Ruth makes a spirited but unsuccessful defence of their action and decides to run away. She is found next morning by the vicar of a small village church where she has slept the night. He listens to her story and sends her home with a new determination to get on with her Aunt. Terry, the Gipsy boy who is a great friend of theirs, has broken his back by falling out of a tree. Terry's mother is poor and cannot look after him properly. So Philip and Ruth decide to put their savings into buying things for him. To no avail. The death of Terry causes confusion and sorrow. Ruth has prayed for him and God did not listen. Only Mr. Tandy the old shepherd has any sort of adequate answer to her questions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530747</url></doc>
