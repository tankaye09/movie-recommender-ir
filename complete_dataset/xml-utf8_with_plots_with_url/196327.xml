<plot>As fish swim and survive between the glass walls of an aquarium, so does our motley group of misfits attempt to stay sane while being trapped during a major rain storm in Tom Dowtin's home on stilts in the Hollywood Hills. Tom was unable to attend his "big break" studio game show pilot, where he was to be the host, due to the storm and subsequent mud slide, which has closed the road in front of his home. Tom and his group of friends, attempt to salvage the aborted night. After a decision to hold a mock game show on this night, to pass the time, they find out less about hosting and winning and more about themselves and each other.
