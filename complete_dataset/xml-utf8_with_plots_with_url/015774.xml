<plot>On the eve of his inauguration, the President-Elect is killed and the country faces a situation the Constitution didn't provide for. To complicate matters the small group that forms to find the killer consists of a reporter, the President-Elects daughter, the Secret Service Agent originally assigned to protect him, and the original assassin who had targeted the President-Elect but never had the chance to complete his mission.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015774</url></doc>
