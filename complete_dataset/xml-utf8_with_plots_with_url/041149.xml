One day while returning home, he comes to the assistance of Sapna, who has journeyed all the way from North America after hearing of the sudden death of her uncle, Gupta. She has an ancient document in her possession that reveals the location of Shiv Ling, and any one who obtains it with proper prayers will enable the flowing of Akash Ganga, and with a sip of this nectar will attain immortality and invincibility. The Shiv Ling becomes visible to mortals only once every 72 years that too on the occasion of Maha Shiv Ratri. She confides about this document with Arjun and Guruji, Arjun secures the Shiv Ling and entrusts it to Guruji.
