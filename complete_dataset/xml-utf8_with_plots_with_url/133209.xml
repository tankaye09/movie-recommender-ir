<plot>An earlier version of FUGITIVE IN PARIS. A beleaguered scofflaw flees to Paris to become someone else. He meets a model named Coco (Corinne Mallet), and they drink champagne and make love. While he robs banks, she models, until she decides to rob banks too. Eventually they go to Normandy to chill out, but something peculiar happens. No longer sustained by the criminal act, he becomes unmoored and loses his personality altogether, merging with Coco's. Then, with the police on the trail, they are forced to split up. He ends up in a seedy hotel room in Mexico, dying of selflessness. Coco ends up in London with two personalities, but no happier.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133209</url></doc>
