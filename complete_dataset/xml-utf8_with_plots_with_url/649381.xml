<plot>Webster has lost his job and is ready to give up; on everything. In a bizarre attempt to end his time on earth, Webster uncovers what he believes to be a discarded teddy bear while digging a shallow grave. Fortunately for Webster this seeming ordinary toy has extraordinary powers that could save his life. Told in a style from silent films this film uses five compositions of Beethoven's music to take the place of conventional dialogue and is possibly one of the first Atlantic shorts to employ a six foot teddy bear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649381</url></doc>
