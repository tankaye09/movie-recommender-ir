<plot>"This scene embodies probably the only moving picture extant of the ill-fated battleship 'Maine,' blown up in Havana Harbor. It was taken, together with the 'Iowa,' in the Brooklyn Navy Yard but a few days before the 'Maine's' departure for the South. Most of the men shown in the picture were killed by the explosion under the 'Maine.'"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061315</url></doc>
