<plot>Li Shen is a Chinese boy whose mother moves him to America in hopes of starting a new life. Li Shen is unwilling to embrace the society he finds there just as the beach community he moves to struggles to accept him. He finds his only solace in playing the viola his father left behind which leads to to his first friendship in this new place. Mindy Smith, whose popularity at school does nothing to make up for the lack of attention she receives at home, tries to befriend Li Shen after hearing him play his viola. As a shared passion for music bring the two together, they learn that all anyone needs is a chance to look past appearances and be accepted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641068</url></doc>
