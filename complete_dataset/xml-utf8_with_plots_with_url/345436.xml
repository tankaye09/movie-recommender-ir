<plot>This compilation of three award-winning films is about relationships, the barometer of the human condition. Featured are Caroline Leaf's Two Sisters, a story about a stranger who penetrates the insular world of two sisters; Michèle Cournoyer's A Feather Tale, a disturbing story about obsession; and Wendy Tilby's Strings, a portrait of two strangers intimately linked by the shared floors, ceiling, and plumbing of their apartments. In addition, the filmmakers talk about their films and the capricious creative process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345436</url></doc>
