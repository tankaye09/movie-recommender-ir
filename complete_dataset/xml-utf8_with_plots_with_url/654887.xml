<plot>Five teenagers take a trip. It begins as a simple enough endeavour but leads to the most extraordinary journey of their lives. The group makes their way to Big Bear, California, to participate in one of the biggest snow boarding contests in the world with huge prize money. As they reach the snow covered town, everything seems normal. It is a big party town and the place to be. The small town is packed with people who have come from all over the world to quick slide and party. He who controls the moves, controls this town. The unimaginable becomes reality as people start to disappear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654887</url></doc>
