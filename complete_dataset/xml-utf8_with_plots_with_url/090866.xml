<plot>The Santa Fe's great transcontinental limited was photographed just out of La Junta, Colo. The picture shows, first, the "Hibernian Express" or the section men and their hand car. The car comes into the picture while the limited is still several miles away in the distance. The "express" is stopped a few hundred feet down the road, the men alight and begin work on the track. The limited with a monster mountain-climbing engine, comes rushing up amid great excitement and seems to jump out into the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090866</url></doc>
