<plot>In Mist Valley it's 6 o'clock and all is far from well. Detectives Harris and True continue their stakeout at 43rd street after convincing Doctor Grant Stride, Nobel Laureate in Medicine, to act as a mole and work for the mysterious criminal, Silver Bee. However, they soon discover their meeting is destined to be more reunion than recruitment, and Dr. Stride's patriotism is put to the test when Silver Bee reveals her intentions to create a weapons of mass destruction bomb with the help of his perfect explosion experiments. Meanwhile, Evan Evans serves his parole at Wheels and more, and Miguel, still his slave for life, is forced to accompany him. But Evan's parole officer, Stoltz, seeing a chance, offers him freedom for his darkest secret...his dartist secret. On the other side of the country in Washington DC, Lobbyist Ellison holds Ryan Kettlebone hostage while trying to force Senator Evans to pass the Arms Availability Bill and pass automatic weapons into the hands of children. Unfortunately, Senator Evans learns that this is the least of his worries when an old 'friend' enters the Senate race along with his army of giant spiders.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?348943</url></doc>
