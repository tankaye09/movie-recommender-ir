<plot>In this scene John the Baptist, a strong, stern man, rugged in character and rude in dress, stands within the river Jordan, surrounded by numerous people. Christ appears in the distance and walks solemnly to John. John does not recognize Jesus at first. They walk together in the water. Jesus is sprinkled in baptism. Then there appears a recognition of Jesus. John falls upon his face before Him, and the throng does likewise. Jesus then comes up out of the water, and as all bow before Him, He prays fervently as the scene closes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425370</url></doc>
