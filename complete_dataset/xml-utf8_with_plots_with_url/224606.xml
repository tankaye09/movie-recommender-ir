One day, Sun-ho's family receives a letter from his grandfather in Seoul, whom they had thought was dead.

Sun-ho is devastated because he can't take Yon-hwa with him but he promises to take her to Seoul as soon as possible after arriving in the South. In Seoul, he tries to save money to help her escape from the North. But one day, Sun-ho hears that Yon-hwa has married another man.
