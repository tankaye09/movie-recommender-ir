<plot>In 1970 at age 5, Daizy Gedeon moves with her family from Lebanon to Australia. In 1993, she returns to see if anything is there besides terror and to discover her past. She begins with ancient history: Phoenicia's trade dominated the Mediterranean, Jesus began his public life in Cana, and splinter sects sought refuge in Lebanon's mountains. Next, with stories from Omar Sharif, Gedeon explores the dynamic and tolerant society that emerged from Ottoman rule and French occupation, Lebanon's golden age. Then, in 1975, war breaks out. Gedeon argues that forces beyond Lebanon's borders and culture promote the war, and that a "wonderful tolerance" is still at the country's root.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328043</url></doc>
