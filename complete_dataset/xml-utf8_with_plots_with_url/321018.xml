<plot>This program combines the basic and intermediate steps together and builds on the basic steps taught in the first program in this series, Latin Dancing for Beginners. Also includes advanced style tips for leading and following for each step of each dance. Teresa Mason teaches the gentleman's part first, then joins her demonstrating partner for the lady's part. The patterns are demonstrated in an easy-to-follow method, designed to make the student confident about his or her ability to execute them in any social setting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321018</url></doc>
