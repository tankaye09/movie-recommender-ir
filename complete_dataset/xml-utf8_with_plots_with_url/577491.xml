<plot>One of the early shock-talk shows, Downey was a precursor to later hosts such as Jenny Jones, Ricki Lake and Jerry Springer. Downey's show tended to focus on political, rather than personal issues, but guests were still chosen on the basis of their dislike for one another, and their tendencies to lose their tempers suddenly, loudly and violently. These outbursts were encouraged by 'moderator' Downey, who would continually goad his guests to their limits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577491</url></doc>
