<plot>Another entry in Universal's series of Musical Westerns Featurettes that ran from 20-25 minutes, starred Tex Williams, Deuce Spriggins and Smokey Rogers, and all incorporating archive footage from various Universal westerns that starred either Bob Baker or Johnny Mack Brown, "Western Courage" (production no. 5357) is a pocket-book remake of Brown's 1940 "Law and Order", with the leads costumed to match Brown, Fuzzy Knight and James Craig from the original: Traveling to Roaring Forks, ex-Marshal Tex and Smokey help rescue Deuce from a man who claims Deuce cheated him in a card game. In town, the man assigns his henchman Chuck Gorman to "take care of" Deuce, but the gunman is shot instead by Tex. The shooting is witnessed by Ruth Eaton, who is aware of Tex's reputation as a law-and-order town-cleaning lawman, and asks him to help do the same for Roaring Forks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650997</url></doc>
