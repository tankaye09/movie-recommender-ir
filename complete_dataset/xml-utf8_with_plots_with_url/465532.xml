<plot>In this game you must lead Robin and his merry men through Sherwood Forrest and fight the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Robin Hood is a team-based real time strategy game. You can control up to six different characters with different trades in a mixture of real time action, strategy and sneaking. You have to kill enemies, make them drunk (Friar Tuck's special ability) and investigate the area. All six characters have different special abilities and weapons. If you don't want to kill people, make them unconscious and tie them up with Stutely, for example. A lot of tactical and strategical knowledge is needed to free the land from the evil Sheriff of Nottingham.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465532</url></doc>
