<plot>Jimmy Smith (Peter Benson) wakes up to find himself Crazy Late for his own wedding. Armed only with adrenaline, his best man Travis (Ben Ayres), and sheer determination, Jimmy has mere minutes to arrive at the ceremony. To make matters worse, the fates beset Jimmy with a series of staggering challenges to test his fortitude and moral fiber. During his 10 minute odyssey, the husband-to-be is yelled at and jostled by enraged suburbanites as he stumbles half-naked towards his wedding. Jimmy ducks, leaps, and dunks his way through the many obstacles that plague his footrace across the suburban landscape. At great personal risk, Jimmy valiantly rescues Ms. Berguson (Mary Black) from the clutches of villainous robbers, and asks only for a corsage as his reward. He then reunites with Travis to obtain his tuxedo. However, the authorities are in hot pursuit. Travis makes an honorable sacrifice and stays behind to detain the police. Jimmy continues on to the last leg of his epic race, now equipped with the necessary ingredients for matrimonial victory. In agonizing misfortune, Jimmy trips and falls flat, ruining his corsage. Jimmy collapses in despair, lamenting his shameful appearance and lateness. With a throng of angry citizens on his heels, Jimmy's situation seems dire. However, a little girl (Devyn Dalton) witnesses Jimmy's misfortune and eloquently attempts to inspire him to continue. Will Jimmy regain hope and arrive in time to wed the woman of his dreams? Will love triumph over Jimmy's ragged appearance and tardiness? Find out in this one-shot epic adventure thrill-ride that's guaranteed to throw you out of your seat and have you crawling back for more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118014</url></doc>
