<plot>Akira had to transfer schools upon graduation because of her father's job. She was reluctant to move because of her secret love for Nao, a childhood friend. Nao, however, is head over heels for Tamaki. A farewell party is planned for Akira. She had longed to spend the final day with Nao, but oblivious to Akira's feelings, he invites Tamaki to the party instead. An argument ensues at the party, prompting Akira to leave. Akira cannot forgive Tamaki for playing with Nao's feelings.
