<plot>St. Petersburg. Winter twilight in the Summer Garden. A man in black-- the letters P, O, E, T printed in white on his back-- sees the statue of a Muse come to life... and starts to follow her into the night, reciting the poem she inspires. Simultaneously, some expressions show up on the sheet of snow covering the city: a pattern of dead leaves, calligraphy by an invisible hand, the "A" of an electric light tube set ablaze by a tongue of fire.... But the magic powers of this mysterious beauty, Anastasia ("Resurrection"), work more directly: she switches on the street-lamps by snapping her fingers; the church bells ring with her laughter; crying, she brings rain.... Vasilevsky Island, across from the Hermitage, violins trembling under the starless sky. Striding along the Neva, the heroine is undressed-- like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon-- provoking an eclipse of the rising sun. Whose bleeding reflection on the frozen river pours out "LAVA" : a huge inscription turning from red to yellow. Next to his Muse changed into a living flame, the poet melts into an ink stain... before the thaw carries everything away.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175612</url></doc>
