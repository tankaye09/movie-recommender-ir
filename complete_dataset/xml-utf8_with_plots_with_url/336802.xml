<plot>Up-and-coming screenplay writer, Vincent Knight, is in a rut. After a successful debut five years ago, his much anticipated sophomore project is merely a collection of unfinished material stored in his computer hard drive. As each day passes, the weight of producing a script becomes unbearable. Naturally, he starts questioning his talent, and the stress begins to change his relationship with his long time girlfriend. Despite her love and understanding, Vincent can't help taking his frustrations out on her. One day, Vincent decides to pen a love story based on his own relationship. The writing starts off well but, once again, Vincent can't seem to complete the project. On top of his writer's block, Vincent's production company gives him a one week ultimatum to finish, threatening to pull his contract. With his back against the wall, Vincent finds himself in a deep psychological warfare. He makes a rash decision, and in doing so, dramatically changes the dynamics of his relationship with his girlfriend. How will this change in Vincent's life affect the story he so desperately wants to write?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336802</url></doc>
