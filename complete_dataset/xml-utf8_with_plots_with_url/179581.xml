<plot>ENTREMEDIO / A PLACE WITHIN, is a physiological romantic thriller where the power of love and of the mind when impacted by severe physical and emotional traumas, can make what seems real, not real at all. Noah works as an investigative reporter for his town's newspaper. Young, attractive and full of ambition, he finds himself in love with Yin, a girl he has known for many years. Because of new events in Yin's life, Noah feels compelled to finally declare his love for her. Noah arranges a dinner where he will finally have the nerve to declare this secret love to Yin. Due to a call that interrupted the dinner, Yin was not able to stay. Noah was not able to tell her. Confused, anxious and disappointed, Noah leaves the restaurant. On his way to his home, he runs into Frankie, an old acquaintance with a shady past, who convinces Noah to join him for a few drinks. The following day Noah wakes up determined to speak with Yin. As he tries to connect with Yin, he discovers that Yin is nowhere to be found. Yin's telephone is disconnected, strangers occupy her home, and there is no record of her working at her law firm. As Noah attempts to unfold the mystery of her disappearance, the history of even her existence is questioned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?179581</url></doc>
