<plot>John's DVDs Is a Powerful Display of His Own Personal and Private Workout Routine! This handsome and massive fitness expert teaches you, step by step, while he pushes, lifts, and curls through each exercise - the very chest, biceps and triceps routine he personally uses to create his own cut, and perfectly defined physique! He demonstrates with his ripped and pumped body, exactly how each muscle group responds to his amazing workout routine. John has a Massive Pumped Chest, Biceps and Triceps... and Now You Can Too! The DVD is about 40-50 minutes long, gorgeously shot on digital, and also contains jaw dropping bonus footage of John on the construction site putting his powerful muscles to work, and catching some down time getting his Harley ready for a day on the road!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256133</url></doc>
