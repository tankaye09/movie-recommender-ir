<plot>Eldi, a 40 year old high -school teacher, is in a midlife crisis. He just returned from a long army reserve service in Jenin and informs the school principal that he is not coming back to teach. His midlife crisis is blended with the trauma caused by the loss of his friend, who was killed in front of him by the gunshot of a sniper in the observation post. Eldi's wife, a psychologist, suggests that he get away for awhile. Rather than getting on a plane, Eldi sets out on a journey in his own country. Traveling incognito, he discovers an unknown world in the middle of Tel Aviv. A world of Turkish and Romanian foreign workers exploited by shady Israelis who hire out laborers and control a group of prostitutes. He is drawn into the world of these foreign workers, finds he is attracted to a Russian woman hiding from an Israeli who bought her to be his wife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273737</url></doc>
