<plot>A professor/scientist (Prabhu) develops a formula that enables the soul to move out of a body into the closest dead species. He accidentally exchanges bodies with his lookalike college student (also Prabhu). The student refuses to switch back into his body, so that he can get the professor to sit in on an important examination as his double. The switched student now must deal with the professor's sexually aggressive wife, while the professor needs to take on goons antagonized by the student.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103812</url></doc>
