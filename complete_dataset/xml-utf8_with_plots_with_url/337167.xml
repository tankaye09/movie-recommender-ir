<plot>Win Kao, a golf pro turned tycoon and playboy, is short of cash and faces a hostile takeover engineered by Jenny Wu, a tough career woman. Win's leverage is undercut by a tell-all newspaper story probably written by Zsa Zsa, a lovely reporter who's dating Win's son Charlie. To save his business, Win invites Jenny to work with him, a prospect she considers because she finds him attractive. Charlie hopes to persuade Zsa Zsa to join him in graduate studies in the U.S. Just as Win has his past, so Zsa Zsa has a secret. Can these passions avoid collision? Will family tragedy repeat itself?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337167</url></doc>
