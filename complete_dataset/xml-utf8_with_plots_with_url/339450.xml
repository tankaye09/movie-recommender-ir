<plot>The craze for reality TV spawns an independent thriller based on the premise of TrialVision, a cable channel televising courtroom trials live. The trial run, so to speak, involves four suburban teenagers accused of slaughtering a family. The case hinges on one crucial piece of evidence: the raw, unedited video diary of the girl Lizzie, which, as the film opens, is about to be played in court. "Lizzie" becomes a film within a film, drawing the viewer into high school corridors, car back seats, and teen bedrooms as the story builds to a horrifying conclusion.
