<plot>One of the most difficult subjects to get. The picture shows the cowboy pursuing the angry steer, swinging his lasso and finally catching the animal around a forefoot. A quick turn throws the steer. The cowboy dismounts and runs over to the prostrate animal to tie his legs together. The pony, with the end of the rope fastened around the pommel of the saddle, backs up and keeps the line taut. The steer is tied and another takes his place. At one point the cowboy mounted on his agile pony rides up in front of the camera and the audience can see in immense size just how the rope is fastened, how the horse pulls and finally, just how the steer is thrown. Charlie Irwin of Iron Mountain, Wyo., one of the most famous cowboys in the world, is seen in the picture, plainly recognized and more than life size on a large screen. This film makes a great companion for the broncho films.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514981</url></doc>
