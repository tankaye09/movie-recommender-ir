<plot>Seated on a bench near a beautiful lake in the park is a nurse girl and by her side is a baby carriage with her charge. As the baby becomes restless the nurse is seen to give the child a nursing bottle. About this time an officer of the law approaches and becomes rather chummy with the nurse. While thus engaged. Weary Willie enters and immediately takes advantage of the situation by extracting the nipple from the child's mouth and, placing it in his own, settles down to enjoy a good meal. The scene ends as Willie almost succeeds in capsizing the boat of a party of would-be rescuers. As an amusing and side-splitting picture this is without an equal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596749</url></doc>
