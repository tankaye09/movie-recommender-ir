<plot>"Agony" dealt with viewers problems. Some wonderful examples were "I can't have sex unless the family dog is in the room" and "I'm Stuffing the Turkey, He's Stuffing the Neighbour". The show was made by low budget TV station L!VE TV. Each "letter" (usually made up in a rush by some poor L!VE hack) would be dramatised and then discussed by the studio presenter and two agony aunts. The show also used bubble thoughts, an on-screen device to reveal what the character was actually thinking, although normally it was just a way to get away with crude jokes about sausages and "you came quickly". A damn good way to waste a half hour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026116</url></doc>
