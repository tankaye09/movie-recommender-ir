<plot>If two's company, three's just trouble. As modern-day hipster vampires bound together by their rock band, young anti-heroes Claudia, Justin and Lance all deal differently with their blood-lust. The boys live life on the edge, taking each kill as it comes, whereas Claudia has recently thrown in the towel: "a vampire who doesn't like killing people any more". But when the roguish Justin and trigger-happy Lance screw up Claudia's well-laid plans to hit a rural blood-bank, she is suddenly given the choice she thought she always wanted. Vampire matriarch Elizabeth sweeps in and flexes her muscle, offering the clued-in Claudia a choice between a life of control and power with her and her combat-squad of girl-vampires, or her knock-about life with the flawed - if fun - boys. In the choice she makes, Claudia realizes she values her relationships with her friends over her need for control, and that when it's all done and no-one got dusted, maybe she is the one that has to change. In Claudia's journey we see it's not so much the end point that matters but who you have with you on the way. Like 'things', friendship ain't always as it seems. Three friends, two choices, one bank.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564117</url></doc>
