<plot>"Bolerium" captures a day-in-the-life at one of America's most important independent bookstores - Bolerium Books - run from a hidden location in the heart of San Francisco's immigrant/radical Mission District. This 23 minute portrait is a humorous exploration of the store, its diverse staff and the wild array of customers who frequent its shelves. Filmed in a handheld style, the documentary captures the caffeinated energy that has driven this store for the last 25 years. A whirlwind of activity, Bolerium Books is dedicated to preserving the history of the world's social movements. They house the largest collections of Gay &amp; Lesbian, Chicano and Spanish Civil War materials in the United States. Trotskyism is the fastest selling section in the store, but they have also sold thousands of Gay Pulp novels and Black Panther posters. Run by two "standup comedians and walking encyclopedias of The Left," Bolerium is a community hub, sponsoring queer zines, sending books to prisoners and helping young socialists find gainful employment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078136</url></doc>
