<plot>Magic Man is a documentary film that chronicles the dramatic ascent of perpetual underdog and Brooklyn's own, Paulie "Magic Man" Malignaggi, a scrawny kid from a broken home who, in his quest to prove his life was worth something, defeated all odds to arrive at the Mecca of boxing, Madison Square Garden, one big upset away from proving everybody wrong and defeating Miguel Cotto, thus winning the WBC Junior Welterweight Title. It's a story of disappointment and determination, of stamina and salvation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351842</url></doc>
