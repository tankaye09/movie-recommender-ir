<plot>George Plimpton becomes quarterback for the Baltimore Colts on "Plimpton! The Great Quarterback Sneak," a one-hour documentary. The author, whose original donning of pads was recounted in his book, "Paper Lion," joins Colt veterans John Unitas, Tom Matte, and John Mackey for a in-depth look into professional football training camps. He also gets his chance to exact "revenge" on his old Detroit Lion friends - like Alex Karras - in a pre-season exhibition game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436182</url></doc>
