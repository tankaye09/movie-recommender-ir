<plot>After three mail carriers have been killed and robbed of lumber camp payroll money, Corporal Rod Webb of the Canadian Mounties, is sent to Bear Creek. The body of each mail carrier who had been slain had been mauled by a huge bear, its tracks plainly visible. Disguised, Corporal Webb, with his dog, Chinook, undertakes to deliver the next shipment of money. In Bear Creek, Rod meets Fergus McLish , Hudson Bay factor, his office girl, Madelon , Jim Barclay , mine manager, and LeRoux , a burly trapper, who when Rod first sees him is buying supplies, including a case of honey from the post. Carrying the mail, Rod is attacked by a huge bear, trained by LeRoux to kill men on command. Chinook attacks the bear and saves Rod, but in the excitement LeRoux accidentally shoots and kills his Indian Partner, Grey Shadow , the son of Lone Eagle , tribal chief. Yellow Flower believes that Rod killed the chief's son, her husband.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?668095</url></doc>
