<plot>Steve is just your ordinary, everyday high school student-with chronic insomnia. As a result of his sleep deprivation, he is caught in a downward spiral, alienated from his classmates and everybody around him. A worried teacher phones the boy's neglectful father who expresses no concern, and then advises Steve to go to a clinic after school for kids with problems. Steve finds it difficult to fit in even with other troubled adolescents, but finds one friend in the form of Jane, a friendly and nonjudgmental girl who sits behind him in English. Steve finally opens up to Jane about his sleep problem, which is somehow related to a mysterious tattoo of an eye on the back of his neck.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?495354</url></doc>
