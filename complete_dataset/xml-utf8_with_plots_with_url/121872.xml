<plot>Curly Oxide was the stage name of the young Hasidic Jew who wandered into a Brooklyn bar where Vic Thrill and The Rev. Vince Anderson played their barbaric folk and gospel music. Thrill struck up a conversation and a mutual interest in music led Thrill to invite his new friend to visit his nearby gas station home/recording studio. The duo began sharing their cultures and writing and performing music together that yielded a strange and novel mishmash of punk-rock, liturgical Jewish music, and all things on MTV with off-the-wall, heartfelt lyrics inspired by Curly's exciting new experience of pop culture and the struggle with his old world identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121872</url></doc>
