<plot>Best friends Malachi and Neil roam the streets of South London looking for adventure. Their world is the timeless present of childhood and when they are together they are without fear. But for Neil, playing out with Malachi is an escape from the daily horrors of his abusive home. Around the corner and through the railway arch is an abandoned warehouse that Neil and Malachi have made into their very own secret hideaway. There they live out their childish fantasies, safe from harm, until one day they discover they are not alone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435629</url></doc>
