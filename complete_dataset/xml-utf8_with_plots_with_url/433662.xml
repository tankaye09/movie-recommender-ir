<plot>A little goat gets kidnapped by a UFO while sleeping in a peaceful, albeit a little bizarre, countryside. What happens next is a menagerie of bits and pieces of places and characters all inside the head of a little female goat named Piper, who will take us on a very weird journey to find how these places and characters make her tick. These are creatures of the subconscious; and though she does not want all of them to be inside her, they will forever be part of her mind, like a bad memory. What memory? She does not know. She is just a goat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433662</url></doc>
