<plot>Young Josh McAlester is in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up in prison for a crime he did not commit. When he's released, he finds that the Sheriff in his small, Texas home-town is determined to destroy his life and sabotage any job prospects. Things go from bad-to-worse when another ex-con, noted sex-offender/religious zealot Tom Sykes stumbles into town with a mission. It seems that Sykes has developed an interest in Josh's beautiful sister, Katy, and wishes to express those desires. When Josh finally gets a solid job-lead from a drunken traveling salesman, George Hodges, the murderous Sykes uses the opportunity to join the fray and get closer to Katy. Sykes kills the salesman and tries to kill Josh but ends up altering the crime scene to frame Josh for the murder. From that point on, everything that Kay, Josh and the Sheriff do turns out to be completely wrong... based upon their determination of how things "appear." With the police and time against them, Katy and Josh must prove their innocence and save themselves from the relentless Sykes. Superb thrills, and lots of surprises that will please audiences of all ages.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072662</url></doc>
