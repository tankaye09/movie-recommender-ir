<plot>Adonese is returning home from seeing the woman he is courting, and he is driving around a corner when his car accidentally brushes against the tramp 'Faithful' and knocks him over. Feeling sorry for him, Adonese helps him up and buys him a new suit of clothes. The naively innocent Faithful reads too much into this gesture, and he begins to follow his benefactor everywhere, expecting to receive future gifts. Soon Adonese becomes frustrated, and he looks for a way to free himself from Faithful's constant presence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187958</url></doc>
