<plot>On the surface it seems that everything is fine with Calvin. He's your average twenty-one-year-old who hangs out with his friends and goes out looking for girls. However, beneath the surface, Calvin still hasn't learned how to deal with his father's death, or even muster the courage to move out of his mother's house, and his only means of dealing with any of this is by drinking. Forced to see a "life specialist," Calvin remains steadfast in his ways until the one thing comes along that makes him want to change for the better: a beautiful girl.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619077</url></doc>
