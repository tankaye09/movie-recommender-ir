<plot>Shows a number of bathers enjoying a dip in the surf. A young lady is suddenly seized with cramps, throws up her hands, and goes down for the second time. A life boat approaches and one of the life guards seizes her by the hair as she sinks for the last time. She is pulled into the boat and rowed ashore. The picture then dissolves showing the beach, the half drowned girl being carried from the boat to the dry sand. A crowd gathers. The girl is finally restored, and is so overjoyed that she hugs the heroic life guard.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335617</url></doc>
