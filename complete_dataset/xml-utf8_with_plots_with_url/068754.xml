<plot>"A rare scene in midwinter is a boy on a wheel trying to forge his way through the drifting snow. In this film the boy is seen struggling along, when he is discovered by the 'gang,' who pelt him with snowballs, and finally overturn the wheel. After a lively tilt, he manages to mount the wheel again, and retreats to the amusement of the other boys."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068754</url></doc>
