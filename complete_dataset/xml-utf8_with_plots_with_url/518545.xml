<plot>STRIP CLUB KING - Loved..Admired..Hated!!! Charismatic to some and revolting to others. Joe Redner owns one of the most famous nude clubs in America, the Mons Venus. Although Joe has been fighting the city of Tampa since the 1970s, Joe Redner and the Mons Venus came into the national spotlight in 1999 when Tampa's City Council tried to ban lap dancing. The city ordinance passed, but not without an explosive fight that made national headlines with feature stories on ABC's "20/20" and Comedy Central's "The Daily Show". Joe redner has been called many things including pimp, pervert, patriot, philanderer, politician, instigator, intellectual, self- promoter, humanitarian, hypocrite, publicity hound, pig, exploiter, criminal, narcissist, hero and genius. This is the first documentary to explore the life of legendary Strip Club King, Joe Redner, also known as the father of the lap dance. Directed by Shelby McIntyre and produced by Chris Woods, this documentary explores the man that has been arrested over 140 times, earned his GED in jail at the age of 40, became an avid student of the law, got clean and sober, and has run for local public office 7 times. Whether you love him or hate him you will want to watch him every step of the way!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518545</url></doc>
