<plot>Brussels, Belgium. A hospital in the inner city. Three patients in the infectious diseases ward. In this precarious and isolated existence the ill are involved in a fight with their own mind and body. The filmmaker is a privileged witness of an utterly personal event, but he consciously avoids the customary human interest approach. Van Paesschen reports on his encounter with the radical Other. Human confrontation turns into cinematographic confrontation: he denies himself, nor the viewer, any release.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661070</url></doc>
