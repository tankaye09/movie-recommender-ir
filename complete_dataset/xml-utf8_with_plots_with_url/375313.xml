<plot>The pilot episode "The Alignment of The Stars" introduces the main characters: three overweight friends: Ema, Virgil and Xandra, each of them dealing in their own way with the weight problem. The TV announces the alignment of five planets of our solar system and the possible end of the world. Virgil, lying about his weight, plans a date with his secret online lady friend in two months, time by which he hopes to be thin and up to the tampered photo he has sent her. Xandra finds out from her clairvoyant, that she's in possession of some bad money that needs quick disposal......to a trained professional like, let's say, her clairvoyant. Ema gets a new and awful job at an obscure TV Channel. After a profound analysis of their situation the three friends decide that if the world would end, there won't be any point in losing weight so they can eat as much as they please and if it doesn't to use this chance to start anew.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375313</url></doc>
