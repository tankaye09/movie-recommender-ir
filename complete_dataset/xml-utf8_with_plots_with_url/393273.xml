<plot>Nervy Nat breaks into an apartment house by climbing up to the roof via the fire escape and making his way through the scuttle. He is then shown entering the apartment where he finds a bed of very comfortable appearance. Without further ado he proceeds to make use of the bed, and is soon sound asleep. The maid then enters and seeing Nervy Nat comfortably stretched out in the folding bed, quickly slams it shut and runs for a policeman. The policeman soon enters, and opening the bed finds Nervy Nat somewhat warped but still in the ring. The picture ends as Nervy Nat is being carried off to a police station.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393273</url></doc>
