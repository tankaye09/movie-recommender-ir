<plot>Four people, two couples, one problem. Intelligently woven together, Decaf is a comic and clever look at the pitfalls and pratfalls of life and love. Blaine has finally found the love of his life in Kate, but the personality mismatch that creates sparks also creates friction. Meanwhile, Ryan and Caitlin are destined to be together, which is too bad since they are utterly nauseated by each other. Although these two couples go through their lives completely unaware that the other pair exists, they walk similar paths along the line between love and loss.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134448</url></doc>
