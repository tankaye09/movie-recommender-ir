<plot>Many people have seen pictures of the Royal Gorge, but few have ever seen the Gorge itself. Well, all is necessary is to show them this picture, taken from the front end of a locomotive coming through that famous and grand spot. The hanging bridge, the streams, the mountains high up in air--all are visible. The picture is indeed grand. Picture taken through courtesy of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway, the Scenic Line.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469543</url></doc>
