<plot>"Depicts a boating scene on an inland lake at a popular summer resort. Two boat loads of pleasure seekers start from the wharf, and come to the front of the picture. One of the oarsmen, losing an oar, jumps headlong into the water, while his boat and its female occupants float out of reach. The figures are large and well defined, and the effect of the sunlight on the rippling water adds brightness to the scene."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077025</url></doc>
