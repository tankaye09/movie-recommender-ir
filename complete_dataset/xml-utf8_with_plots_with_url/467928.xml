<plot>Two burglars are at work on a roof when they hear the gendarmes approaching. They climb over the balcony and hide while the officers advance, meanwhile having a trap for them. Finally one of the officers appears, and in his zeal to catch the culprit, he ventures too far and breaks through the roof of the cupola on which he was climbing. He falls backward with his feet in the air. The burglar now comes forward and pulls off the officer's boots. He then ties a weight on him to keep him down and the midnight marauder escapes. A comical subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?467928</url></doc>
