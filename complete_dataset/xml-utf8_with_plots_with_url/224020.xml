<plot>A heroin addict is abducted and taken prisoner in an isolated cottage deep in the Yorkshire countryside. But as the woman cold-turkeys, it becomes apparent she knows her kidnapper: It's her estranged father. For him it's a desperate attempt to reconcile their troubled past and build new bridges leading to a happier future. In her mind, however he's one of the reasons she needed heroin in the first place. -And she's not able or ready to forgive him so easily.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224020</url></doc>
