<plot>Tricky TV is a magic and illusion show aimed at children and teenagers, presented by magician 'Stephen Mulhern' (qv). Each episode combines close-up magic, practical jokes, and large stage illusions. A feature of the show is that, each week, viewers are shown how to perform a simple magic trick using common household items. Each show ends with a performance of a classic stage illusion, such as Sawing a Woman in Half. During the show's first season, Mulhern was joined each week by a different guest celebrity, who usually acted as his assistant in the final illusion in addition participating in other parts of the show. From the second season onwards, his _"Ministry of Mayhem" (2004)_ (qv) co-presenter 'Holly Willoughby' (qv) joined the show as Mulhern's regular assistant for the final illusions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?618014</url></doc>
