<plot>Door to the Dead follows psychic medium John Oliver as he investigates a Virginia family beset by ghosts and on the verge of leaving their property for good. John is joined in his mission by Chris Moon, an expert in all things paranormal and possessor of Thomas Edison's mysterious 'telephone to the dead', and Alison Smith, a one-time private investigator and professional skeptic. Using all the spiritual, scientific, and investigatory means available to them, John and his team must identify, evaluate, and eliminate harmful energies from the haunted home and help any trapped souls 'cross-over' into a more peaceful state.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156362</url></doc>
