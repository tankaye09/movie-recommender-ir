<plot>A young man is lead by a small boy to a dilapidated cabin, which may or may not be filled with hallucinatory projections of his fears and desires. An Oedipal descent into the unconscious of its male protagonist The Bower Closet deals extensively with poetic archetypes i.e. the protagonist's relationship to his mother, other women, the self and the dream language of film both visual and aural. An attempt at a pure adaptation of a dream The Bower Closet employs all of the medium's techniques to create a cinematic experience that conveys the subjective and abstract feeling of a dream while maintaining a visual and aural clarity that allows for personal interpretation and speculation as to the content's meaning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545474</url></doc>
