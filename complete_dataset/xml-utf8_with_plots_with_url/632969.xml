<plot>The Fulton Fish Market has served New York from the same downtown location for one hundred and eighty three years. It is to be relocated to the Bronx as part of the city's planned renovations of that area. Up At Lou's Fish chronicles the history of the market, the dedicated workers who sustain it, as well as the artists and writers who attempt to preserve its heritage in their work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632969</url></doc>
