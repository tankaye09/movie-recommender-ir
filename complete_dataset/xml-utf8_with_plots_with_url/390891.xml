<plot>Kanab, Utah, a small, western town founded by Mormon polygamists, is now the scene of a city divided. The people are split between a religious majority, struggling to assert its conservative identity, and a vocal minority determined to make their home in a community afraid of change. Fearing a threat to their way of life, the mayor and city council unanimously approve a resolution. This defines the kind of families they would like to see move in as 'one man, one woman' with a 'full quiver' of children. Natural Family Values is an intimate portrait of a community at odds with itself, and what happens when democracy and theocracy clash.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390891</url></doc>
