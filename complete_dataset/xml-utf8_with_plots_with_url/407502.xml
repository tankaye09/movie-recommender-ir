<plot>American engineer Steve Corey (Steve Cochran) comes to Mexico to work at one of the mining projects owned by Katherine Beckman (Merle Oberon) and her half-brother Paul (Curt Jurgen.) He meets Katherine, and the man he is replacing, Bill Maxton (Steve Brodie), tells him that Katherine is his for the asking..."all you have to do is touch her---she goes off like fireworks. There were plenty of guys before me, and there'll be plenty after me." Steve finds Katherine as advertised but he falls in love with her. Once he sees that the romance is for real, brother Paul is more than a little displeased at this turn of events and brings back one of Katherine's earlier flames, Gus Cole (John Agar), to tempt Katherine away from Steve. Half-siblings Katherine and Paul are carrying some baggage from the past it appears. Actually, it is more than appearances and Paul spells it right out before this exercise in tedium is over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407502</url></doc>
