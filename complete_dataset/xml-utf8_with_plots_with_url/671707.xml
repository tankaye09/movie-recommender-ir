<plot>Yaakov Tcherniak and his son Yitzhak have a small company that organizes parties and events. They travel to weddings, bar mitzvas and birthdays, and supply the sound equipment and a female vocalist who sings Israeli songs. Their dream is to expand the business and supply catering services as well. To this end, they need another vehicle in addition to their pick-up truck. Yitzhak is supposed to be the driver of the second vehicle. Sadly, he just can't manage to pass his driving test. During the course of the film, the Tcherniak family must deal with this and other problems that arise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?671707</url></doc>
