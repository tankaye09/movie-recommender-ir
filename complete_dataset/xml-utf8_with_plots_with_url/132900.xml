<plot>Allen has no idea of the price he will pay for satisfying his overblown ego with yet another affair. But Barney, a quirky - if not demented - con artist, knows Allen's little secret and is prepared to recount it to Melissa, Allen's wife. As the noose tightens around Allen's neck, Barney reveals a new and dangerous turn to his con game. It's more than money that Barney is after. Melissa quickly smells a rat. The stench of lies and deceit reek throughout the house as Allen and Melissa's true intentions are revealed and a guarded past, quietly hidden in the closet, is unearthed. During a long and restless night, Allen, Melissa, and Barney pair off for private conversations of intrigue, exposing secret lives and misconceptions. Who is blackmailing whom? A cat and mouse game of control and power leads a twisting plot to a devastating conclusion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?132900</url></doc>
