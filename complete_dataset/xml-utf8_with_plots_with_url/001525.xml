<plot>Inspired by Michael Kuhn's memoir of the same title, this feature documentary by Michael McNamara chronicles the rise and fall of the company that brought us "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "The Usual Suspects" and "Trainspotting." In 1991, Kuhn headed the British-based PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, and quickly changed how Hollywood looked at films from across the pond. PFE won 14 Oscars, had numerous blockbusters and even more niche hits. But in 1999 the powers that be sold the company (its library later went to Universal), ending an era in British filmmaking and Kuhn's wild ride.</plot><plot>Inspired by Michael Kuhn's memoir of the same title, this feature documentary by Michael McNamara chronicles the rise and fall of the company that brought us "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "The Usual Suspects" and "Trainspotting."
