<plot>The true coming-of-age story of twelve-year-old William Latham, and his enduring friendship with a freed slave named Jordan Freeman. Over a single summer in 1781, the unlikely pair face extreme prejudice, rousing patriotism and excruciating loss during the burning of New London and the brutal massacre of the American militia at the hands of Benedict Arnold and his troops at Fort Griswold, which stands to this day, a grim reminder of Revolutionary War era sacrifices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279286</url></doc>
