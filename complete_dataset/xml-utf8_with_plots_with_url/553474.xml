<plot>5 people audition each week to become a dinner guest. Once they are chosen, the five strangers are blindfolded and taken to a secret location, where they meet the other four over a candlelit supper. From different walks of life and differing backgrounds, each must interpret the others behavior and in turn have their own behavior scrutinized. The five enjoy the evening together, before being taken off and interviewed at length to dish the dirt and give their views on the people they've just spent the evening with. The guests are then invited back to take part in the game part of the show, where they answer questions as to what they thought the other guests really thought of them. As each guest hears what the other guests said about their personality, looks, clothes and sex appeal, looks of shock, horror and hysteria prevail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553474</url></doc>
