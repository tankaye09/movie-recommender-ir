<plot>As the off-screen narrator explains the rules, we watch a game of donkey baseball, with the score tied, well into extra innings. The pitcher, catcher and batter are on their feet; all other players are on donkeys. As soon as he hits the ball, the batter jumps onto a donkey and tries to head for first base. Players can dismount to grab a ball, but must hold onto their donkey's reins. They must remount their donkeys to throw, all throws go to the pitcher (who can't leave a box that's chalked around him), and then he throws to the necessary base. One donkey and rider take off from the park through town. Is that legal? It's certainly asinine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156080</url></doc>
