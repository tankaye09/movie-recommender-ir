<plot>"Wood" follows the journey of timber from the forest through the sawmill and presents a portrait of the working men we find along the way. Shot in and around John Day, Oregon, where many sawmills have shut down in recent years, "Wood" anticipates the imminent closing of the town's remaining few. Despite the heated controversy that surrounds the timber industry, "Wood" eschews easy politics, focusing instead on the actual workers, machines, and raw material involved in this complex situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660482</url></doc>
