<plot>The atrocities witnessed by the world on September 11th were hateful acts committed by terrorists who chose to view their victims not as people but as symbols of a perceived evil they could not, or would not, confront directly. By jailing thousands of Arabs, Muslims and South Asians without evidence or due process, is America perpetuating the cycle of hate and ignorance which claimed so many innocent lives? "Brothers and Others" is a one-hour video documentary on the impact of the September 11th tragedy on Muslims and Arabs living in America. This documentary follows a number of immigrants and American families as they struggle in the heightened climate of hate, FBI and INS investigations and economic hardships that erupted in America following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In interviews with immigrants, government representatives and a select group of legal and historical experts like Noam Chomsky and James Zogby, this film reveals how Americans' fear of terrorism has provoked the passage of reactionary policies to a wave of racial intolerance that has compromised civil liberties and will affect immigrants and US nationals in the years to come.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084455</url></doc>
