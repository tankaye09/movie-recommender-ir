<plot>Here is a great picture, and one that every exhibitor should own. Casey, who is a short, thick-set Irishman, is engaged in shoveling gravel on the street, and is working in front of a steam roller. As Casey bends over to fill his shovel, the roller comes along at a good rate of speed, and knocks him over. The engineer does not see him, and the great machine, weighing several tons, passes over his body, flattening it out like a piece of sole leather. Other workmen rush to the rescue and discover Casey in his flattened condition, and about twice his normal length. There is then a consultation as to how Casey can be put back to his normal condition. One of the workmen procures a barrel, and standing upon it he pounds Casey upon the head with a great mallet until he has driven him down to his proper height and circumference. Casey then resumes his work in evident satisfaction for his marvelous resume.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?368320</url></doc>
