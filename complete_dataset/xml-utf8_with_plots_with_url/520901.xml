<plot>James has a crush on Alexix, but is too nervous to ask her out, despite his best friend Noah urging him on. Alexis is, after all, the hottest girl in school and oogled by just about every guy in school - including the creepy kid Billy, and chemistry teacher Mr. Delange.  After a fun (and alcohol filled) party, James finally works up some courage and he and Alexis soon are dating. Irate, Billy retreats into his psychotic cat-killing "art" and sessions with his psychologist, Dr. Sheppard. Meanwhile, Mr. DeLange asks Alexis to stay after school for a little extra help in her chemistry work. Things go awry when DeLange's tutoring sessions become far too sexual, and Billy decides to take justice into his own hands after witnessing just how far DeLange will go to be with Alexis.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520901</url></doc>
