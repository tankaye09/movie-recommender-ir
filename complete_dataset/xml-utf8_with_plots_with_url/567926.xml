<plot>"The interior of a country school is shown. The teacher has stepped out for a moment, and all the youngsters are carrying on. Two wicked little urchins tie a string across the aisle where the teacher is expected to pass, and when she comes in she falls over it. The children are in great glee over her misfortune, and make a bad matter worse by pelting her with their school books."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567926</url></doc>
