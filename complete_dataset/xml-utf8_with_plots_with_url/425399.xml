<plot>This picture is wonderfully life-like. Christ is seen coming upon the mount, with James, Peter and John, who lie down as Christ engages in prayer. The vision of Moses and Elijah is seen as the disciples awake. They fall upon their faces as the vision disappears. Christ lays his hands upon them and they go off, followed by the other disciples, who are apart from Jesus and likewise resting upon the Earth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425399</url></doc>
