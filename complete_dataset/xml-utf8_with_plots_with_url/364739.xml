<plot>Melee is a 3D animated short film created with Maya 3D. The film's hero, a Space Warrior, is modeled after a well known character from a popular video game. The Warrior comes back to earth after many years of exploring the galaxy, only to find that it has been taken over by hostile foreign elements. He battles robots, alien creatures, and oppressive space corps during his reconnaissance mission. His skills as a galactic warrior, bridled under a calm and collected demeanor, make for an entertaining and charming little story as he encounters new enemies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?364739</url></doc>
