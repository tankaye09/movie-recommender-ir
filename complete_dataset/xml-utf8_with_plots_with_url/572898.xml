<plot>As a woman is walking across a grassy clearing, a man calls out to her. When he catches up to her, he gets on his knees and asks her to be his. When she declines, he takes a small container from his pocket, and seems to consume something from it. Soon he is writhing on the ground in apparent agony, and the woman is overcome with alarm and concern.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572898</url></doc>
