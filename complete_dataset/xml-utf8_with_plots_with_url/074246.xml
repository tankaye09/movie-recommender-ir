<plot>Blank the World! is an independent release looking at the worldwide spread of punk rock and hardcore music. The title features sixteen musical acts which span the globe. These indie artists are from such diverse locals as: Brazil, Switzerland, France, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia, USA, England, Japan, Germany, Peru, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Norway and Cuba. While many of the bands sing in English, other songs are in Spanish, Russian, Portuguese and German. The styles are equally diverse: ska-punk, hardcore, streetpunk, pop-punk, skatepunk, and a few that defy classification. All of the bands on Blank the World! are independent artists, and what they do is a testament to the strength of punk rock as a living, thriving, diverse musical genre. We are very proud to have worked with each and every one of these bands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074246</url></doc>
