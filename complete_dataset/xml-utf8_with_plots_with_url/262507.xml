<plot>This is a rather piquant subject. The scene shows a manicure parlor divided into two sections by a screen. On one side a very proper girl is attending to the nails of a young man. On the other side is a similar couple, but not so well behaved. Whenever the second couple kiss, the pair on the opposite side of the screen hear the suspicious noise, and the effect upon them is very humorous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262507</url></doc>
