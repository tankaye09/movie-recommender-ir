<plot>Another side-splitting picture is this one. A colored gentleman receives a letter informing him that his dear mother-in-law is dangerously ill. Watch the expression on his face as he reads that she is at the point of death. You that have a mother-in-law can appreciate this wonderful picture. Our colored friend hugely enjoys the letter, almost bouncing out of his skin in anticipation of whitewashing the grave of his mother-in-law, when finally the expression turns to that of extreme disgust, the letter at the close informing him that his darling mother-in-law is "out of danger." This film will cause tears of laughter to the most blas√© in your audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?456808</url></doc>
