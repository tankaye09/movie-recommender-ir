<plot>"Is it you?" is a psychological mystery-thriller in which a police officer hounds a brutal serial killer and in which he faces the ill of his past. One year later. The police officer Dennis is called in for work. He has to examine a brutal murder. All signs point toward a serial murder. But the way the women were murdered reminds Dennis of incidents from his past. During his investigation, a mysterious man appears. This man gives Dennis a strange drug, which makes him see the homicides in a different light. The murders remind him of the night he caught his wife with another man. In the course of the investigations Dennis not only loses control of the clarification of the homicides, but also of himself. He drifts into a world that becomes more and more cloudy and morbid until Dennis discovers the cruel truth about himself, his wife, and the murderer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268831</url></doc>
