<plot>A gang of bank robbers hide out in a cabin near a valley road that was closed because of an earthquake. They had just robbed a bank of $50,000, but in $1000 bills, which the leader, Cicero, knows can never be spent. With no other money, they resort to stealing food from the local ranchers. Hoping to have one of the ranchers, Tony, cash one of the bills for them for pocket money, they offer him a $1000 note as a fee. But Tony senses something is fishy and goes for his rifle, and he is murdered. Suspicion falls on rancher Jim Parker, who was the last of the locals to see Tony alive. His sweetheart, Anne Miller, doesn't believe he did it, and rides off to tell him the townsfolk are in a lynching mood. But Jim had followed two of the gang members who he saw stealing his goats, and was riding back to tell the others about the crooks. Anne intercepts him, but he refuses to flee and convinces the folks that the thieves and murderers are in that cabin by the valley. They ride off to confront the crooks and discover that they have taken Anne as a hostage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365600</url></doc>
