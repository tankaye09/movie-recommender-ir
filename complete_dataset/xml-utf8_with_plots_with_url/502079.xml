<plot>The diploma film, marking Kiran Kolarov's director's debut, is a free adaptation of the short story 'Orderly Dimo' by the Bulgarian classic Georgi Stamatov (1869 - 1942). The scene is set in the thirties. The film is about a sensitive peasant boy who is caught in the vice of cruel military machine. From the start his masters treat him as an inanimate object, which can change hands without so much as a second thought. At first he is the orderly of a lieutenant nicknamed The Handsome and must comply with every one of his whims, even entertain his mistress. Than the young orderly is transferred to Major Mirchev where he must wash and iron his things, massage his master and perform all kinds of humiliating chores. All the members of the family regularly humiliate the defenseless young boy both physically and spiritually. A company of carousing guest uses him as a stake in a poker game. The poor orderly can no longer stand his 'official status' and commits suicide in his master's bathroom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502079</url></doc>
