<plot>Rolling in 'La Habana' takes viewers on a moving journey with Ngozi Ugochukwu, a British wheelchair user. Moves away from the picturesque Caribbean stereotypes of sunsets and turquoise beaches she will have to cope with both physical and language barriers, giving an introspective look into her feelings, thoughts and motives, giving a different dimension to the world of disability. Throughout her journey she will come across diverse people and situations- from the odyssey of finding a suitable flat in La Havana to the disappointment of beautiful but cobbled Trinidad, from an improvised boxing session to an unexpected 'Christian Science lecture'- her adventure reflects a true portrait of both Cuba and herself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?467136</url></doc>
