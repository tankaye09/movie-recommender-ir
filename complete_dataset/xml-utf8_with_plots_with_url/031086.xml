<plot>When they decide they might as well be penniless husbands and wives as penniless campus sweethearts, three couples at a Midwestern university, against the advice of their friends, get married. Joe (John Arledge) and Susie Tucker (Betty Moran) prove that two can live as cheap as one by setting up housekeeping in a trailer, and working at whatever odd jobs turn up. Slats (Peter Lind Hayes as Peter Hayes) and Jennifer Warwick (Virginia Dale) marry because they can fight better under the same roof then when separated, and use Jennifer's allowance from home to pay for their groceries. John Gregory (Joseph Allen Jr.), a brilliant pre-med student, and his bride, Kay (Jean Cagney), are in the most serious situation. Kay's allowance is suddenly cut off by her unsympathetic step-mother, while the scholarship on which John is depending is threatened by his inability to do two jobs at once - study all day and work at night to support them. Kay, determined to prevent John from giving up college, takes a series of back-breaking jobs in order to give him time to study. She gets a job singing in a night club, but has to quit when the stork announces an imminent arrival. Her secret, being pregnant, helps her to make up her mind to go back home and leave John free to accept the offer of a professor who wants the promising student to work with him abroad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031086</url></doc>
