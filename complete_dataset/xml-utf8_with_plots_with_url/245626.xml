<plot>Tom Winger is head over heels in love. The girl of his dreams has finally acknoledged his existence after months of friendly ignorance and exchanged a few words with him. What Tom accepts as a clear sign of eternal love and romantic happiness is quite a different thing for his two roommates. Sexual intercourse is on the way - that's a sure thing for professional cynics Markus and Arne. Tom is shocked and refuses to believe that romance is really just a cosequence of his sex drive. A turbulent night commences, confronting him with many obstacles and strangers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245626</url></doc>
