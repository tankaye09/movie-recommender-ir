<plot>The life of Pieter Bruegel the Elder will always remain something of a mystery. We possess few details of his sixteenth century life, and we must rely fully on his surviving art to appreciate his genius. As an artist, he was inspired deeply by his great Dutch predecessor, Hieronymous Bosch. His work reveals typically Boschian themes such as the Follies Of Man, and he used a similar keen humor to convey his artistic message. Bruegel also followed Bosch in his choice of contemporary subject matter. His depictions of peasant life are amongst the greatest in western art. He was also one of the first masters of landscape painting, and his satirical drawings are as relevant today as they have ever been, while religious works combine simplicity and depth in their spiritual message.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554648</url></doc>
