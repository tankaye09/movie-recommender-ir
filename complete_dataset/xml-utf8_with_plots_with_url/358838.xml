<plot>Two men trying to illegally smuggle their Aunt and uncle into the country but are mistaken as drug smugglers by a small group of vigilantes. They are taken to an island where they are to be executed and buried with previously murdered drug dealers. The only problem is, the uncle is a voodoo priest and he raises the dead from their graves to get revenge for the killing of the aunt. A 14 foot monster from hell, crazed vigilantes, and 84 zombies, try to keep our heroes from getting off the island.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?358838</url></doc>
