<plot>George Cooper, a successful bank executive, lives in an exclusive neighborhood with his dim-wit wife Liz. The neighbors for the first two seasons were the Cobbs, a snobbish family. They were replaced in the third season by the Shephards who were less snobbish. Reruns on the show were broadcast in 1957.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383824</url></doc>
