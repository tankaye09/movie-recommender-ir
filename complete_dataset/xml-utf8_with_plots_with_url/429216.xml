<plot>A long-time resident of the east end of Long Island, Albee does most of his writing in Montauk where he remains an avid supporter of LongHouse Reserve. In this original performance, Albee uses audience suggestions as a point of departure for his dramatic improvisational sketches. Part 1 - A 60 year-old Hungarian poet who has a girlfriend half his age. Part 2 - Catherine the Great, the empress of all of Russia. Part 3 - Jackson Pollock's gravestone. Part 4 - A very petite 40 year-old woman who is very beautiful. Part 5 - An aging Palestinian hijacker, who has hijacked a number of planes. Part 6 - The owner of Red's Car Shop in Pittsburgh. Part 7 - An aging Shakespearean actress whose lover just died. Part 8 - Woman who lives in East Hampton having a conversation with a deer in her garden.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429216</url></doc>
