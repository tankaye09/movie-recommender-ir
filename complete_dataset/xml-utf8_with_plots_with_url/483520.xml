<plot>"Can't read at all. Just follow my own mind in my head. Music is the only thing I can do" Alice is 29. She and her friends Helen, Lynn and Julie have learning disabilities and it's hard for them to communicate verbally. Now they play celtic harps and sing in The Dancing Drum. For them, music says what can't always be spoken; to feel what can't otherwise be felt and creates a space where they will be heard. Secret Heart is a unique portrait of their lives. Fragments of past and present, of families and friends, of feelings and hopes, are woven together with their music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483520</url></doc>
