<plot>The Pink Panther goes on a cruise to the South Seas for 14 days, but the expected luxurious holiday turns out to be quite the opposite. The ship is a pirate ship, and the captain is a merciless pirate who orders the panther to squab the deck - or walk the plank. The panther mistakenly sets fire on the mast, which burns down instantly. When he is ordered to load the cannons, the rolling sea rocks the ship heavily and makes the pirate fall overboard and all the cannonballs to fall on top of him. The panther manages to escape the plank by giving the pirate sob stories about his old mother and his starving wife and family. When the pirate tries to kill a vicious shark with a cannon, the cannonball instead cracks a hole in the ship and it sinks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433388</url></doc>
