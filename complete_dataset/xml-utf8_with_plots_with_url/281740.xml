<plot>At the Sandwich Islands, which includes the "deviled egg" island, the "hot dog on a bun" island, and the "hamburger" island (with a sign, "Hold the Onions"), we see a man on the "tunaville" island surveying the area with a telescope. He notices a crate full of musical instruments wash ashore and alerts the others. The tribe finds these instruments strange and unusual at first but eventually really get the hang of them, particularly one member who plays a hot piano, his playing being somewhat interrupted by a pestiferous crab.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281740</url></doc>
