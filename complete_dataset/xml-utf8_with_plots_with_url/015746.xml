<plot>A Season to Wither takes place in the rural countryside in a house that sits at the end of a dusty road on the top of a hill just outside a small town. A place that seemingly fell from the sky and dropped right in the middle of nowhere. The air is filled with an eeriness reminiscent of a tale from the Twilight zone. A large storm moves in threatening to destroy an already dilapidated house belonging to a young woman named Mary and her Father who is stricken with the plague and forced into quarantine by the towns people. As the storm begins to erupt so do the memories and emotions that have been locked inside of Mary as the tragic events of her childhood rise to the surface.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015746</url></doc>
