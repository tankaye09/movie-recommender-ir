<plot>A young messenger comes to a second-hand bookseller to fetch a number of books. While his packet is made ready he goes around among the bookshelves. Suddenly a book drops to the floor. He picks it up, opens it at random and reads a brief erotic excerpt. An 18-year-old girl circles around him in an unrealistic way. She asks, "Did you like it?" He does not know. She says, "Do not follow me" and leaves the shop. He disregards his errand, puts the book under his jacket and follows the girl on his moped. He finds her sitting on a bench in a part of a church where numerous urns are placed in the walls. She does not answer anything he says. Then he once more opens the book at random and reads another erotic excerpt. Then she goes around a corner, but when he immediately follows, she has disappeared. Somehow his attention is drawn to one of the name plates on the wall: "Anna Stavgård b. 1910 d. 1928". He opens the book and sees the ex libris with the name "Anna Stavgård".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184971</url></doc>
