<plot>A woman takes a revealing blue leather dress to a used-clothing shop; it reminds her of a man she now detests. During that day, three women wear it and two more recall wearing it: its effect on them and on men is powerfully erotic. Debby and Tammy recall how Nigel used the dress as an aphrodisiac with each of them. Claudia tries on the dress and snares the clerk's attention. Later that day, she loans it to Lorraine who wants to get her boyfriend's attention, but before it works its magic on him, Lorraine's secretary borrows it to lose some of her inhibitions with a job applicant. Even though the dress, whose one size fits all, never stays on long, the high heels do.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412627</url></doc>
