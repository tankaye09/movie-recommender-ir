<plot>Being a Sasquatch can't be easy. It's a busy life. Day to day nuisances like paparazzi, or so called TV "animal experts" dressed as bananas keep trying to bring light to your personal situation, you barely have time to skateboard and swim and club it up and do your Sasquatch-y things. It's bad enough these TV people won't leave you alone, but when you borrow a cell phone off of one of the crew members from the animal show trying to expose your life, you get the guy's pesky wife after you. It's a lose/lose situation for a Sasquatch who would rather just be left alone; or is it? Join Sasquatch on a seat-of-your-pants thrill-ride, no wait; Join Sasquatch in this timeless romantic masterpiece, no wait; Just watch as some of your favorite idiots from the website full of crazy you've come to know and love as GDZ Films (gdzfilmz.com) take a good shot at putting their minds together and comprising their first (almost) feature length film!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?487105</url></doc>
