<plot>Someone is lying on the floor, beaten and bleeding. We flash back to Alex, a young man with a beautifully appointed house, getting ready for a night out. As he leaves, he picks up a card that will gain him admission to a club operated by Sixx Productions. Satanic influences seem at work: the club's bouncer is the identical twin of the bartender, a striking young woman sits down next to him as if on command. When he takes her to his home, a shadowy figure lurks, watching them. What Alex does during the rest of the night brings us full circle, and it may be one of the circles of Hell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344684</url></doc>
