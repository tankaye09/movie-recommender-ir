<plot>This film tells the story about the contributions that women did in the Canadian wartime aviation industry doing manufacturing jobs that were considered unthinkable before World War II. This film in particular focuses on the staff of Canadian Car and Foundry in Fort William which was a major producer of Hurricane and Helldiver fighters as the women did their jobs while dealing the sexism around them. In addition, this film features the story of the company's Chief Aeronautical Engineer, Elsie MacGill, who was the first Canadian female engineering graduate and the world's first woman to design an airplane.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?468772</url></doc>
