<plot>This film was taken in the gardens of the Zoo, and is familiar to all Philadelphians. The Swans glide gracefully over the water in quest of food, scarcely causing a ripple on its surface. They are accustomed to be fed by the visitors, and have learned to know those who wish to feed them aside from their keepers who contribute daily to their menu. A pretty picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191675</url></doc>
