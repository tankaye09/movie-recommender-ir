<plot>A number of Italians are seen laying a mine to blast certain rock that lies in their path. The mine is finally laid, and the fuses lit, and they all disappear with the exception of one, who, forgetting what had taken place, seats himself directly over the mine and prepares to enjoy his mid-day lunch. The explosion follows and he is thrown in the air. After the smoke clears away his hat finally falls and he follows shortly after. Everyone viewing this picture shudders to think that this man has been blown to pieces for by the time he reaches the ground one is bound to imagine him crushed by falling on the rocks. Judge of the surprise in store, however, for those in the audience when the man arises with a frightened look on his face and dashes from view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370756</url></doc>
