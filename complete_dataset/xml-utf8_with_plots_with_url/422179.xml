<plot>Arriving for a regular job, a z-list film crew meet Brett, the actor who has hired them to make a profile of him for a show reel he is putting together in order to secure an American agent. As the job unfolds, the crew discover Brett is not as pretentious as he seems - he is just downright crazy! The dubious circumstances he was dismissed from his last acting job, naked wrestling with his students, an odd fascination he develops about a member of the crew, and the near death beating he takes at the hands of the local faction of the Hells Angels - do little to deter Brett from making his "Masssive Johnson" alter ego show reel. However, in the end it is his own eccentric quirks that scupper his ambitions. Although, in showbiz, strange things can happen to those who dare to dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422179</url></doc>
