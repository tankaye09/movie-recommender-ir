<plot>A Chinese street vendor stands on the corner displaying his basket on which is a sign "Hot Mutton Pies." Two boys come along and each purchase a pie which they devour with great gusto. As they eat, the Chinaman changes the sign so that it reads "Hot Cat Pies" and a couple of cats jump out of his basket. The boys throw their pies away in disgust, and the Chinaman is greatly amused.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246547</url></doc>
