<plot>To everyone else, Adam seems like the luckiest guy in the world. His high-tech company sold for a fortune so he's an overnight millionaire, and then he married Lynda, his long-time girlfriend and the woman of his dreams. However, after honeymoon is over, some problems creep into the marriage such as Lynda finding out Adam is sterile so they can't have children. Worst of all, Lynda begins to suspect Adam might have been responsible for the death of her only brother. Those accusations push Adam over the edge so he begins contemplating the unthinkable - murdering his wife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249671</url></doc>
