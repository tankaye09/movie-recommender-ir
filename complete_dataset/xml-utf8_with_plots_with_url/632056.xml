<plot>Beatle Boyin's business cards read 'Towing/Assassination'. She has been working on the infomercial for her Hit Man Training Video for months now, but to no avail. Athena Klendon is the disowned daughter of a billionaire with suicidal tendencies and a big secret. The night they meet, Beatle saves her from Kyle Sorensen, Athena's violent, drug-running employer, and the pair strike a deal: Athena will change her life insurance policy to reflect Beatle as the beneficiary in exchange for her own execution. While they wait for the paperwork to come through, Beatle will provide Athena room and board in return for a little help with her infomercial. All they have to do now is avoid Bruce Morley, the twisted, sado-masochistic henchman Kyle has put on their trail. Throughout the course of this dark romantic dramedy, Beatle and Athena manage to show each other entirely new perspectives on life, and even get the chance to fall in love along the way. But, what does fate actually have in store for these two, young, star-crossed lovers?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632056</url></doc>
