<plot>Every year in late October, the best Ultimate teams from across North America compete in the Ultimate Players Association Club Championships. Having qualified in a series of sectional and regional tournaments, the winner of nationals is generally considered to be the best team in North America, and often, the world. In 1999 and 2000, Mike Bell, Lance Larson, and Brad Holmes traveled to nationals to document the drama and excitement of Ultimate at the highest level.  The resulting three Above and Beyond programs ('99 Open, 2000 Open, 2000 Womens) have become the best selling Ultimate videos ever produced, and are watched by players and non-players around the world. Above and Beyond: The DVD includes all three A&amp;B videos with a ton of extras including: - Optional commentary tracks by great players discussing what it takes to in championship (featuring: Steve Mooney, Jim Parinella, Billy Rodriguez, Molly Goodwin, Christine Dunlap, Corey Sanford and JD Lobue, Jr.) - The complete final game of the 2000 UPA Open Championship, an exciting match-up chaptered by scores so you can skip ahead to your favorite part. - Additional in-depth interviews with players talking about what Ultimate means to them. - Separate instructional segments for newcomers to Ultimate. - A hardcore opening sequence featuring the best moments of all three videos in 60 seconds. - And a couple of hidden easter eggs that you just might stumble across if you look hard enough.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021519</url></doc>
