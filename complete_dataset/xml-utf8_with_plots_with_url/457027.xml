<plot>A droning account of several famous pirates &amp; pirate bands interspersed with commentary by several unanimated experts, featuring movie clips, still painting, &amp; repeated video that don't really convey the dramatic &amp; violent lifestyle that is the topic of this would-be documentary. Contrary to the suggestion of its title, this is NOT an adjunct to the Disney film it attempts to expose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457027</url></doc>
