<plot>This is a typical country scene. A beautiful girl is seen standing on the porch when a city "masher" comes along and flirts with her. He induces her to sit down on the edge of a pump trough in front of the door and without much ceremony they fall to kissing and hugging enough to make you wish you were "in it." Finally her dad comes out and witnesses their actions. He sneaks over and without attracting the attention of the masher, sends his daughter into the house and seats himself next to his "dudelets." "Willie Green" is having a good laugh all to himself and does not notice the change. Without looking he attempts to kiss the supposed lassie by his side, and comes in contact with a bunch of "finecut on the hayseed's face." He turns around and discovering what he is up against wrestles with the old man, who is one too many for him and who proceeds to hold the masher under the pump while he gives him a bath, much to his discomfort. This film is full of rich effect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345940</url></doc>
