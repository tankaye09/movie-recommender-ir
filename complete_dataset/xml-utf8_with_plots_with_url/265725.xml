<plot>Dane shocks his girlfriend Cara by revealing that he has bought them an old large house (a 20's bordello) without her knowledge. Cara is angered because the house is too expensive and they have a lot of debt, and she is infuriated that the two couples invited to the surprise party include Dane's spiteful ex-girlfriend Monica. The jealousy, catfighting, and desire for revenge between the two women leads to a game of sexual partner merry-go-round for all three couples. The next morning Cara is missing. Did she get mad and leave, is she a victim of foul play, or does the missing hooker from the 20's bordello have something to do with it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265725</url></doc>
