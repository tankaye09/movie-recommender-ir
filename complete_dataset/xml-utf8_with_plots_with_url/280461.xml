<plot>Distraught after betraying his friend and Rabbi, Judas tears through his memories to find a motive. As he sets out to discover the consequences, Judas wonders, almost without control, toward his inevitable punishment. Plagued by a whirlwind of emotion he returns to familiar grounds, visiting his youth, the call to ministry and the frustrating questions that followed. An awestruck follower? A skeptical traditionalist? Was Judas chosen to betray? Did he want Jesus to die? Was he allowed forgiveness?Texan filmmakers team together to complete a 5-minute short that raises difficult questions while illustrating unique scriptural perspectives. The material challenges typical religious views as it explores the private trials of Judas Iscariot, an individual who is often portrayed as a simplistic character rather than a complex person. The film uses intimate narration supported by non-linear montages to render an engaging story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280461</url></doc>
