<plot>In the vacated downtown of a metropolis a storm approaches and envelops - except this is no ordinary meteorological phenomenon. A digital wind blows the debris from an overflow of information - the city is now occupied by a rushing whirlwind carrying a tangled mass of communication. "Current" follows the path of this storm blowing through the abandoned city like tumbleweed through a ghost town. As devices of technology hovering in the enclaves between skyscrapers seem to monitor or perhaps even propel the storm, the city is consumed, erased by a blanket of information. Shot during the 2000 Yankees ticker tape parade, "Current" documents a space between truth and fiction. Through careful camera work and an evocative soundscape, a reality present during the parade, but largely unobserved that day, comes alive. Shot and edited nearly one year before the catastrophic events of 9-11-01, "Current" has become a prescient and eerily accurate document of the collective fantasy of destruction that permeates much of American culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121887</url></doc>
