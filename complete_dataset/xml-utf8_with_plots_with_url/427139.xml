<plot>Claire Tree is a singer/dancer who goes after what she wants in a straight-forward, no-nonsense manner, so when she finds herself in the New York City hotel-suite, in fashionable Peacock Alley, of Stoddard Channing, she wastes no time. Claire wants to get married. But, Stoddard, whom she cares for very much, has several proposals directed at her, none of which sound remotely like a marriage proposal; Claire tells him, in her straight-forward, no-nonsense manner that she wants to get married because, in her words: "I'm running away from the doubts and uncertainty and problems of a woman who isn't married." Stoddard thinks that nuptial bonds is a stupid old-fashioned tradition and fatal to romance. She says any man who says that is lying, and when she departs his suite at the crack of dawn, she seems convinced Stoddard indeed believes what he said he believed. But Claire has another option awaiting her...a Texan from home, and she promptly accepts his marriage proposal. But the house detective comes along after the ceremony and tells Tex his version of what he thinks goes on when a woman stays in a man's suite until the crack of dawn, and that doesn't jibe with his definition of a moral woman, and he ups and leaves her. Stoddard comes along and he thinks Tex has made a mockery of the marriage vows he took a short while ago, and he tells Claire that he will marry her, as soon as she can get an annulment from that day's ceremony, and they will make a go of it because they are 'different.' Somewhere in the 24-hour setting of this film, Claire plays a piano and sings a song called "In My Dreams, You Still Belong To Me," and then does a tango with a partner; and then does a solo-dance performance, interpreting a bullfighter...in costume...in 2-strip Technicolor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427139</url></doc>
