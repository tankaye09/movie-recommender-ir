<plot>Two married couples compete in this short-lived game show hosted by Jim Peck, in which one of the partners on each team sits in the Hot Seat and becomes hooked up to a lie-detector-type device that measures responses to emotional questions. The other partner must attempt to guess how his or her spouse will react to various questions. Each question is worth a certain amount of points, with the highest point total in each round earning the winner up to $400.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?565193</url></doc>
