<plot>Sophie, a student of Egyptology as well as Christoph, an out-of-work actor, apply to a classified ad in the newspaper for a job. "Someone to look after my house for six weeks - good pay." It's a box number ad, and both get the job - with one not knowing about the other. They enter the house and meet each other. Sophie doesn't want to stay six weeks in a house with an unknown man. So thinks Christoph: he doesn't like the idea either. But, after the postman brought two registered letters with advance payment, they decide to try it. The rules say that both of them can do what they want in that house except one thing; there is one room which they are not allowed to enter, and is to remain locked. They barely agree to this arrangement when strange things begin to occur. Sophie and Christoph are looking after a house with a locked room - where everything (...or nothing) can be concealed from others. "All houses have a forbidden room" says Christoph, Sophie's answer, "just like our soul."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?129235</url></doc>
