<plot>Heretofore a picture termed "Two men reading a sporting paper." We have revised the old time idea and here offer and old sport and an old lady with sporting blood in her. After reading the funny things in the Sporting Page at which they are gazing, the old lady fondles the old gentleman apparently to his entire satisfaction. The facial expression in this picture is exceedingly fine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579092</url></doc>
