<plot>A look at the relationship and opinions of Bill Crisp and Mike Render, two men who have lived together for 33 years. They met in Vietnam in 1969, where Bill was a colonel and Mike a lieutenant, then a captain. They describe their meeting, how they felt each other out, their first embrace, and then their reunion in Kansas City after both completed their tours in Vietnam. Archival footage of them in Vietnam mixes with their contemporary commentary. The foxhole is the metaphor for how they constructed a life as lovers outside the public eye. By the end of the film, they are out of the foxhole and focused on health and happiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201805</url></doc>
