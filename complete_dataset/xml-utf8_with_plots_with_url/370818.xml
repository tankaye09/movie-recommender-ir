<plot>Lin has to look after his father's small pawnshop, while his father is hospitalized. His impish girlfriend Eiko, whom he met on the internet, comes to help him, when she is not working at the hospital. She calls Lin by his online pseudonym "No-lines" because he lost the lifeline on his hand in a motorcycle accident. Instead of checking IDs, Eiko suggests they take customers palm prints, so she can practice her palm-reading. Lin is attracted to a girl who comes to collect her pawned watch, and he arranges to meet her at the station, without Eiko knowing. The pair then try to sell off uncollected pawned articles, between stops on the subway train.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370818</url></doc>
