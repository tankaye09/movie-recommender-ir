<plot>In 2002, seven couples in the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit in hopes of legalizing same-sex marriage. "In Sickness &amp; In Health" closely chronicles the journey of three of these couples: Chris and Craig have been together for over 36 years. Marcye and Karen are mothers of two beautiful children and have spent the last 15 years together. The most poignant characters in the story are Marilyn and Diane, partners of 14 years, who were dedicated to fighting for the marriage right they desperately desired. Before their dream could be realized-many months before the New Jersey Supreme Court heard the couple's final argument, Marilyn was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. You will be forever changed after stepping into the lives of these couples, watching them fight for the right to marry the partners they love-and, tragically, watching one couple's heartbreak as their dream dies at the cruel hands of ALS. While Marilyn and Diane never officially took the vow "In Sickness and in Health," they, unfortunately, felt the pain of 'death do us part'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262254</url></doc>
