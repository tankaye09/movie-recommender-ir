<plot>When I was little, I was the curly-haired star in the "Anti-Communist Eloquence Competition". There was a painter who participated in the reproduction of the pre-historic drawings from the Lascaux cave. His artistic talent had peaked the interest of the French critics. But in 1967, his life dramatically changed when his uncle, Ungno LEE, was condemned for espionage of Berlin-Est. And being the nephew of a Coco was enough to make him a spy. This film is about a meeting between these two.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?296774</url></doc>
