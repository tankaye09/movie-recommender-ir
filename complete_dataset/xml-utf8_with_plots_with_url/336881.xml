<plot>Angelica wants more than anything to be an angel. She's been to the Academy, passed her physical, now all that stands between Angelica and the job of her dreams is one exam paper and five minutes in LiMBO. Angelica must sit her GCCE exam (General Certificate of Celestial Education) in the LiMBO waiting room. But what she doesn't realize is that it's not about how she answers the questions. Set during an average day in between this world and the next, LiMBO looks at tolerance, patience and judgment. A quirky and intriguing look at the business of sorting souls.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336881</url></doc>
