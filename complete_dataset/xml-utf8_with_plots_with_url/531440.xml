<plot>Sethji is a widowed, a businessman and lives a comfortable life with his only daughter, Hansa, his son-in-law, Rahul, and a grandson, Munna. He has Rahul as his right-hand man, and a nephew named Dinesh who also assists in running the business. Petty rivalries and jealousies have grown in the family, and Sethji and Rahul feel that Dinesh is now trying to undermine the business. They would like to get rid of him, without attracting any attention to themselves. They do terminate Dinesh, but this effect's Sethji's health, and he passes away. Shortly thereafter Hansa also passes away, leaving Rahul to look after the business on his own. But there are many questions unanswered, like why was no one in attendance with the ailing Sethji; Hansa's death was a suicide, why was it covered up?; what of the affair that Rahul is having with Janki, their maidservant, who is full of venom for the family; and the involvement of Anita, Rahul's secretary, in his personal life. With the police getting involved, it is time for them to either come clean or go their separate ways.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?531440</url></doc>
