<plot>It focuses on the upheaval that the people of the isolated village of Rapayan are experiencing. Living in Peru's highlands, they are the direct descendants of a once great civilization. As we follow Canadian archaeologist Alexis Mantha and his team searching their ancestors's ruins, we discover a culture that has forgotten its past. Conflict arises. The ruins threaten to crumble and Rapayan's peace is now in jeopardy. The village is going through a turning point. The signs are there. A foreigner is unearthing mummies. Past, present and future are becoming blurred as a paved road advances towards Rapayan and modernity is catching up with it's people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?455476</url></doc>
