<plot>Stone, a seasoned hit-man, wants to retire. He has had enough of the violence and the brutality and wants out of the merciless firm he works for. The bungled killing of a young woman further convinces the veteran that it is time for him to leave. The only way out, however, is to find a replacement.

Over the course of a day's work, Stone must prepare the young upstart for the ultimate test - to kill another human being in cold-blood.
