<plot>There was a devastated small village. One day a young photographer called J came into the village to take their pictures and it made them happy. Since many of the people from the village started going to his studio, the previous photographer lost many of his customers so he accepted the offer from 'Ji-sik-jang'. The village people had an emergency meeting because the pictures they took were being distributed around the next village, this reduced the work given by the next village and their suspicion about the young photographer grew. Things get extreme after it is revealed that there's something special in his pictures and that there is also a secret about the people in this weird village.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271515</url></doc>
