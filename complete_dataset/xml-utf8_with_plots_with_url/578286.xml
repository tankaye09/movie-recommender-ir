<plot>Two burglars are engaged in cracking a safe. The watchman enters and the fun begins. The burglars appear and disappear to the great confusion of the watchman. They are seen leaping through windows, flying up through the ceiling, suddenly appearing from behind doors, under the safe, etc. This is simply so comical that it defies a lengthy description, but it is a sure winner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578286</url></doc>
