<plot>Charon, the mythic demon sailor over the river Styx, sets off on a journey to recover his mortality. He renounces his immortal role as ferryman for the dead and sails away on a sea of oblivion in search for the archetypal home, the mythical place of his childhood where he can finally abandon his boat and die. During his travels he explores metaphysical spaces that represent the various stages of his journey, from the darkness of timelessness through to the soft, warm light of childhood and memory as seen through the eyes of an old, dying man. The slow and relentless progression through space, emphasized by the strain in the old man's body, is accompanied by the discovery of what it means to be a human being, the ultimate revelation being that within the eternal circle of life and death, the true meaning of ones existence is contained and justified. Charon reaches his final home, where he can trade the coins he has collected from the myriads of souls he has carried on their final journey for his own place in the boat that will deliver him to his final destination, the end but at the same time the beginning of his journey. This film is about memory, mortality and time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100566</url></doc>
