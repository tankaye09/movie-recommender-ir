<plot>A jaded hipster named Reza -- lost in a dead-end job, and a culture of irony and passive recreation -- is struck by the realization that he can't quite seem to care. His free-spirited friend, Amy, has kept him level until now... but she's moving to Australia in a week, and Reza fears that he'll be totally lost without her. Amy vows to kick Reza out of his rut before she leaves, and so begins a subtle, touching, and humorous awakening that includes actual footage of a guy in a bear suit break dancing in a suburban mall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261450</url></doc>
