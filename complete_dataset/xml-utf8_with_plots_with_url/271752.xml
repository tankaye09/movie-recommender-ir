<plot>After returning from overseas, heiress Rita is stressed-out and needs to go someplace to unwind. She choses to go to Kashmir, and upon arrival there decides to rent a houseboat from the owner by the name of Raja. After a few misunderstandings, both are attracted to each other and soon fall in love. This romance is not looked upon favorably by Raj Bahadur Chunilal, Rita's dad, as he would prefer his daughter marry a suitor he has chosen for her by the name of Kishore. Rita dislikes Kishore, and will only marry Raja, so the wily Raj Bahadur devises a plan that will let him keep the cake, and eat it too.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271752</url></doc>
