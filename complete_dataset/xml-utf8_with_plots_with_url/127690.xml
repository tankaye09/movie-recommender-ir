<plot>The Middle Ages. It's Christmas time in the small village of Bortonville. Old hag Agatha and her adopted son Shlomo, the heroes of our story, live and work in a cozy little bakery at the edge of town. While Shlomo is busy caring for his sulky stepmother and running the family business, Agatha prepares herself for the annual baking contest. But although her father was the most successful baker of his time, she has never won the much sought-after trophy. But failure begets ambition. And this year Agatha is determined to win. With the help of an ancient recipe she is planning to bake the most delicious magic apple pie ever. In no time the magical ingredients are found and the baking is about to begin. After days of work Shlomo and Agatha are heading for the competition. And indeed they win. The whole village is thrilled by the extraordinary taste of Agathas creation and at last she is celebrated. But Agatha wouldn't be the vindictive hag she is, if she hadn't planned something beyond victory. So the exquisite apple pie has a strange side effect: A few minutes after consumption everyone who tasted it turns into an apple. And one by one the whole township is transformed. So, at the end of the day, Agatha and Shlomo are literally able to collect the fruits of their success. And they will bake happily ever after...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127690</url></doc>
