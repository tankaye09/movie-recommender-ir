<plot>When the notorious "Black and Tans" arrive at his village of Clonmore, IRA man Denis O'Hara discovers a plan to raid a secret IRA meeting, and he races to Dublin to warn his colleagues. He reaches the city, but is shot and captured by British soldiers. Denis is imprisoned in Kildare, but manages to escape along with his fellow prisoners. Believing him to be dead, his mother goes blind from the shock, and his girlfriend Moira is abducted by fellow villager Beecher, who is in league with the Tans. Denis arrives back in Clonmore just in time to rescue Moira. With the burning of the Customs House in Dublin, the War of Independence is soon over and a truce is reached with the British.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268474</url></doc>
