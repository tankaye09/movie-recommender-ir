<plot>A wonderful mysterious film in which the magician performs the most marvellous tricks, changing his own costume several times by simply waving his hand in the air. In several instances he stands upon a table and jumps to the floor, and while he is in mid-air his costume is changed instantaneously. A perfect piece of photography and a most mystifying picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351933</url></doc>
