<plot>Best described as a love letter on film, Letter To You is a narrative about the effects of love and the consequences that arise from it. Told through the eyes of DAMIEN, this sad tale questions if the love he had was really love. Told with an introspective view, Damien hopes to find the decision he is looking for with the hope that his former flame can hear him. Through his eyes, he examines the relationship exploring the time line from beginning to end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333783</url></doc>
