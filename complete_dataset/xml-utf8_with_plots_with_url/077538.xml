<plot>From his home in the back woods of New Hampshire Bode Miller seeks to challenge the very best skiers in the world -Â a sport dominated by European skiers. But Bode must find his own way down the mountain and he stubbornly sticks to his own methods, even if those methods might lead him to disaster. We start with Bode's family who moved to the mountains to realize their dreams and ideals and gave to Bode "An Epic playground for a kid" where his talent, tenacity and fierce Independence are forged. We move to his unlikely 11th place finish in a World Cup race that brought him onto the US Ski Team. And we move with him to Europe as he challenges the likes of Hermaann Meier and Kjetel Aamodt to become one of the world best skier's. We follow Bode through the 2002 Olympics where he becomes known to the world and then the 2003 World Championships where he realizes his talent. But throughout we are looking for what makes Bode go so fast, and will the very qualities that drive him fast, drive him over the edge of control?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077538</url></doc>
