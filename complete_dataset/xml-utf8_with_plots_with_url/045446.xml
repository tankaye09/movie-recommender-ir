<plot>Arjun Poojari lives in a small village in Central India with his mom, dad, &amp; an unmarried sister. The entire village is grateful to Bade Thakur Jagawar Choudhry for all the work he has done for the village. Then one day Arjun finds out that Jagawar's younger brother, Vikram, had attempted to molest his sister. He beats him and takes him to Jagawar, who slaps him several times and asks him to seek forgiveness from Arjun and his sister. That night, Arjun is summoned to Jagawar's house and in his very presence, his sister is sexually assaulted by all Choudhry brothers, including Yogeshwar, Virendra, and Vishal. Arjun revolts and becomes a dreaded Dacoit - his mission: to kill all the Choudhry brothers at any and all costs. Then Vishal Choudhry becomes a Police Inspector and is transferred in that district, but is unable to stop Arjun killing Vikram. Before any of the brothers can recover from this shock, Arjun also kills Vishal himself. This prompts the brothers to seek police protection, and to hire a hit-man named Devaa - a dangerous man who will do anything for the right price - and this time he has his guns aimed in Arjun's direction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045446</url></doc>
