<plot>Patrick is a young man hunted by dark visions which soon turn to reality; David is a police officer open to the idea that such premonitions may be true, while his partner George, a corrupt and violent policeman, is eager to pin the violent crimes on Patrick. Professor K supports David's idea that Patrick is an innocent man with an extraordinary ability to see into the future; while Tina is the girlfriend David tries to distance himself from, in order to protect her from the dark world he had started to be confronted with.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?359499</url></doc>
