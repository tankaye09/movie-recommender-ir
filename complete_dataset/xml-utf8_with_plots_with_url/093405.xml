<plot>Seven short films, each illustrating a virtue, stitched together by music and by a reoccurring look at a partially-built bridge. A young feckless man gets his just comeuppance, a moment of charity saves a child's teddy, a lonely widower answers personal ads in an act of courage, someone celebrating his 40th birthday learns a lesson in temperance, a father teaches prudence to his teen children, a toddler plays with rather dangerous toys as his seemingly bored mom looks on (perhaps her faith could stand a tad more action), and a preteen fan comes up with an ingenious and hope-filled scheme to catch the attention of a rock star. Virtues sometimes come in subtle shades.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093405</url></doc>
