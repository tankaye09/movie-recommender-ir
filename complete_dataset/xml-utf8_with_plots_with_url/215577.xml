<plot>Narrated by former driver and motorsports enthusiast Jason Priestley, Girl Racers is a documentary series that charts the course of North America's leading female race car drivers, Danica Patrick, Milka Duno, Melanie Paterson amongst others, over the course of the 2004 racing season. Going behind-the-scenes in one of the most highly watched sports on North American television today, we capture for the first time the unique world of female race car drivers, as they navigate one of the few sports where women compete directly with men. Girl Racers is a story of hopes and dreams, heartbreak and victory and despite their differences, the defining characteristics that bind these women is the conviction that they were born to race.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215577</url></doc>
