<plot>This is a bogus title; there is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was produced by Selig at this time; most likely, it's a working title for another film, identity unknown, or else an announced title for a film that was never made.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570741</url></doc>
