<plot>Untitled composition 1 is a poetic and surreal study of identity, human relations and self analytical on the very subject of cinema and theatre itself as an art form. This is an experiment in minimalism rather than an attempt to entertain. Two members of a disillusioned generation, a man and a woman, get together one dark November night to discuss life, love, sex, politics and almost everything in between. At first she is the more talkative of the pair. Using his silence and reluctance to reveal anything about himself, he gradually manipulates her into taking part of his darker agenda. At first their conversation is innocent. But as they start revealing their true personality to each other and themselves, and decide to play Russian roulette with a loaded revolver, they begin a journey that will change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632111</url></doc>
