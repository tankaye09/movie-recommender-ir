<plot>The true story of an young American Missionary, Howard Baskerville, moved to Iran in 1907 to be a teacher, but his passion for the people of this nation made him a hero. After seeing the government oppression first hand, he becomes the key figure in a revolution that changed the entire course of Iranian history. Based on the critically acclaimed novel of the same name, this epic film tells the story of faith, hope, redemption and one mans sacrifice for a people he did not know but loved, and a country that became his own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262120</url></doc>
