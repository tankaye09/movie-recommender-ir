<plot>Andrea's father used to travel to New York twice a year for a business meeting. He fell in love with the city and started to make a scrapbook collecting information, clippings and Internet pictures about it. One day he decided to take his own pictures of every place in New York he had been to, and put them in the scrapbook. But he couldn't, as he became one of the victims during the tragic events of 9/11. Some years later, Andrea will go to New York and, guided by her father's scrapbook, will take the pictures her father couldn't. That way she wants to find out why his father loved that city so much.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356225</url></doc>
