<plot>This picture was taken especially to give a detailed view of the Temple of Music, the Esplanade and exquisite statuary which is clustered directly in front of the cascades. As the camera swings from left to right we also take in the Ethnology Building and end with the U.S. Government exhibit in the background. This picture is made realistic and interesting by the immense crowds who are promenading about the exquisite statuary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422069</url></doc>
