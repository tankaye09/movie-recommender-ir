<plot>Filmed in Bristol during their '97 stage tour, Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall again adopt their characters of Eddie and Richie from the television series "Bottom", this time being stranded on a desert island with no food, and even worse, no booze or pornography to keep them occupied. Things get even worse during the second act when they discover that a French visitor has left a large nuclear device on the island during the night to conduct weapons testing in the pacific.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080434</url></doc>
