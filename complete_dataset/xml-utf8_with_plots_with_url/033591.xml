<plot>Amancio: Two Faces on a Tombstone, is the story of one man's journey to seek justice for the murder of a young gay man. The body of female impersonator, Amancio Corrales, 24, was found in the Colorado River, brutally beaten, slashed and stabbed by an unknown assailant. The film shares the loss for Amancio's family, whose love for their son extended to including on his tombstone the two faces of Amancio: one as Amancio and one as Delilah, his stage persona. The film documents the outrage of local gay activist, Michael Baughman who pulled the community together to keep law officials on the case. After two years, Baughman's efforts paid off when an anonymous informant led the sheriffs department to the killer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033591</url></doc>
