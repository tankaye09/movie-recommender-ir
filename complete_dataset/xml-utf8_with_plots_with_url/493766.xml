<plot>"Through the eyes of a killer, one woman's worst nightmares are coming true." When Jana Rogan suffers a severe electrical shock, she experiences a series of bizarre and disturbing images which doctors attribute to post-traumatic stress. But when the nightmares continue and begin to reflect a series of real-life murders, Jana is forced to realize that the accident somehow opened a portal into the mind of a madman. When it becomes clear that the connection goes both ways, it's a race against time to find his identity before he discovers hers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?493766</url></doc>
