<plot>From award winning Director Thor Stephens (Love Inn Exile) comes the story of a young man's search for the perfect relationship. Jimmy is a self-proclaimed playboy who has decided to end his wild days and settle down with that "special" man. But, Jimmy is about to learn that being "in love" and committed to a relationship isn't as easy as he had thought. Shot entirely in Laguna Beach, CA., this romantic comedy explores the struggles many gay men face as they try to establish relationships, friendships and their own existence in our ever cahnging "gay" world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318120</url></doc>
