<plot>A man and wife are seated in a street car talking, when the conductor asks for the fare. Hubby rises to get the change, when a hobo, who is seated nearby, slips into hubby's place, and before wifey knows what is about to take place, Mr. Tramp gives her a hearty kiss. Wifey screams, "Go away, you naughty man," which cry attracts hubby, who seizes the tramp and throws him out of the window.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249416</url></doc>
