<plot>Archeology Professor Robert Burns is on location leading an important dig in the ancient ruins on the Far Eastern Chinese border. He accidentally discovers that the Chinese Mafia, the Tong, is using his newly discovered ancient Chinese artifacts to hide and smuggle narcotics across the border. Robert immediately tries to flee with his assistant and narrowly manages to escape the pursuing Tong but not without a heavy price. His loyal assistant is killed and he is framed with the evidence at the Chinese border by the Chinese military and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. He is locked up in a Chinese prison where he is guilty until proven innocent. His loving wife Maya vows to help get him out of jail. The DEA finally convinces the Chinese military that Robert may be of more help to them outside jail by leading them to the real smugglers. Once he leaves his Chinese prison cell Robert would rather enjoy his freedom back in the U.S. and keep his past behind him, but The Tong catches up to him and threatens not only his life but that of his wife. They threatened the wrong man. Secrets of Robert's past start to emerge as he unleashes his awesome martial arts fighting abilities to defend himself and his wife. Now that The Tong and their drug cartel know who he is they will stop at nothing to kill Robert to protect their own corrupt interests. To avenge the lives of loved ones he has lost, Robert must hunt down, pursue and find each of the Tong members. In a classic homage to Chinese martial arts films, he is involved in intense hand to hand combat including sword fighting, guns, car chases, and other ingenious forms of fighting to mame and kill these Tong members. He deciphers their ancient coded Tong tattoos which leads him to their don, Wong Dai- The Emperor; the man who controls an empire of crime and corruption across many borders. As an added twist Robert discovers upon meeting Wong Dai, that the evil man himself has been manipulating our protagonist in order to have him kill Wong Dai's own Tong members and thus, secure the ill gotten gains of Wong Dai's empire of crime for himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417902</url></doc>
