<plot>Over thirty years ago, Nello Pisoni was in a car accident. As a result, he became blind. While many people in his situation might be discouraged, Nello was not. Instead, he told his wife Theresa that he was going to buy an old loom from a neighbor, string it, and make rugs to keep busy and earn money for the family - and he did. In the spring of 2007, Theresa spent the day remembering a time when Nello could still weave rugs, re-teaching herself and her family how to use the antique loom, and talking about Nello. 'Nello' is an account of that experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392759</url></doc>
