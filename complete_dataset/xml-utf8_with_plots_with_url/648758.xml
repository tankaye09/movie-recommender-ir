<plot>Matthew, 20, robs a bank and kidnaps a bank teller, Grace, as a hostage in order to take his ex-lover, Cynthia, whom works as a prostitute, away with him. However, as soon as Cynthia rejects him, Matthew is completely lost with his future. Grace, 32, who has been suffering from a frigid marriage, not only attempts to escape from her victim status, but also is able to re-examine her own life through this journey with Matthew. As their story unfolds, their relationship gradually develops, bonds, and thus opens up a new phase of life for them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648758</url></doc>
