<plot>Jake has visions of the ocean, California sunshine, Ferraris ...one small problem - he barely has enough money to buy a plane ticket. He knows every actor must sacrifice, which he isn't willing to do, so he comes up with the ultimate casting call and places ads in Variety magazine, L.A. Times &amp; the Hollywood Reporter: "Boy Toy for hire! Available only to older women who are wealthy, single, famous, divorced or simply bored. (Net worth must be at least $50 Million) two week minimum booking."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081109</url></doc>
