<plot>The film "De Schone Slaapster" (Sleeping Beauty), is one part in a series of three documentaries with the theme of 'modern fairy tales'. Jeroen Tiemes tries in the film to reveal the mystery of a nuclear power plant in the middle of a local Dutch recreational area. The plant has officially been closed and shut down, but it appears that there are still people working inside the building. The plant has experienced a moving history, together with its factory workers, the people in the neighborhood and the environment activists. Jeroen Tiemes is determined to get inside the imposing building to unravel the mysteries of this legendary 'sleeping beauty'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?132295</url></doc>
