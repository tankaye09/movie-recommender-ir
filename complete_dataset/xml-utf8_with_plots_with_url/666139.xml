<plot>Yossel is the story of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in Poland told through the eyes of a 16 year old boy. Based upon the Eisner Award nominated graphic novel by Joe Kubert. It is 1943, and Yossel is a teenage boy with a gift for art. Uprooted and stripped of their possessions, his family is sent to the Warsaw ghetto with other Jews, where conditions deteriorate as the Final Solution is put into action. Yossel's gift for artwork puts him in favor with the German guards and when his family is sent off to a concentration camp, he is spared. An escapee from one of the camps makes his way to the ghetto and tells of the unimaginable horrors taking place there, leading Yossel to make the decision to become a man and stand up against the Nazis as the Warsaw ghetto uprising unfolds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666139</url></doc>
