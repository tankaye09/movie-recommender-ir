<plot>A group of misanthrope stoners are all scheduled by individual appointments to purchase weed from their drug dealer, Bala, who just so happens to be smoking his own supply on the rooftop. That is, until a neighborhood drug dealer interrupts his daily session as he is chased into the building by the police. This forces the paranoid dealer to enter his apartment, only to find his customers impatiently awaiting his arrival. Hilarity ensues when his neurotic impulses kick into overdrive forcing his customers to lay low until the police leave.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544873</url></doc>
