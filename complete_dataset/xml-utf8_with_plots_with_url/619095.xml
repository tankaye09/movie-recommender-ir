<plot>The 2007 G8 Summit in Heiligendamm/Germany - A summer fairytale, a blooming corn poppy, a brilliant blue sky. An unbelievably large and menacing fence cuts through the picturesque landscape. Police caravans, journalists, and activists face off for days in these fields like medieval armies. Elsewhere, artists despair over a public that confuses pop with protest. Bob Geldof, Bono and Herbert Groenemeyer preach on the "Your Voice Against Poverty" stage, while Rostock locals would obviously rather be eating a bratwurst. Left-wing anarchists try to set everything on fire, though they only manage to get to one car and a few trash bins. Interviews with the likes of Muhammad Yunus (winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize), filmmaker Wim Wenders, Susan George (former vice-president of ATTAC France), U2 frontman Bono, and Campino (singer of Die Toten Hosen) are mixed in with questions and commentary from police, activists, and locals. A regional documentary pop film that critically and playfully explores the egoism of a confused protest generation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619095</url></doc>
