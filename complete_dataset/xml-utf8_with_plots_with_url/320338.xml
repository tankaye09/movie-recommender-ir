<plot>Twenty-five years in the future. A disease laying waste has infected the almost totality of the worldwide population. It is transmitted through the blood and who is struck changes himself in a vital liquid thirsty monster. For such reason these creatures are called "Vampires". They are not sentient, they do not speak nor assume vaguely human attitudes. The fews survived try to organize its to fight the offensive of these new beings. The world is sunk in a post-apocalyptic era, in which the technology is only a dusty relic in the pockets of the survivors. One of them, the protagonist of our history, is a Vampires hunter. What moves him trough this personal struggle it is not given to us. We only know that, supplied with rudimentary weapons, he goes-on undaunted on his road, starting without-a-break struggles with any creature he does find on the way. A bright madness shines in his eyes and will take him to compare with the most terrible of the creatures in a duel to the last blood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320338</url></doc>
