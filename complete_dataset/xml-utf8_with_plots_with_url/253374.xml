<plot>Roger is a young, dashing banker full of boyish self-confidence. He has a highly successful business, smuggling black money across the border for reinvestment. But then a split second reaction changes his entire life. Flagged down one day by a customs officers, Roger loses his cool and makes a run for it. His only means of escape: diving headlong into Lake Constance, thereby catapulting himself out of his life as a banker and into a totally new universe, populated with shy mermaids decked out in Lara Croft gear, and cunning magpie witches in helicopters. As in a Grimm Brothers fairy tale, Roger has to pass three tests to cast off the witchâ€™s curse and find happiness. His underwater journey through an intoxicatedly beautiful Switzerland is enhanced by the enchanting songs of sirens â€" a fable full of lust for life and love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253374</url></doc>
