<plot>EXIT INTERVIEW is the story of Peter, a 33 year-old failed novelist, recently widowed, who is spiraling into his own self-inflicted demise.

While at the interview, a fateful twist of events forces Peter to make a decision that will affect the outcome of his future, his world, his entire existence.
