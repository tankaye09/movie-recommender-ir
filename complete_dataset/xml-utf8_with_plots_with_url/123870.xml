<plot>Advocate Nivaran Chatterjee lives a wealthy lifestyle in a small town along with his wife, and three sons. His first son is married, while his second son, Kedarnath, who suffered a head injury, is a little senile, and his third son, Amarnath, is a brilliant student. Amarnath falls in love with Beeni Mukherjee, who is a good student, has an elder dominating sister, Saraswati, who is brilliant. Kedar is attracted to Saraswati but lacks the courage to approach her. Then some of his friends introduce him as a brilliant student and athlete to Saraswati's dad, who approves of him. Kedar meets with Saraswati, who also approves of him, and both are slowly drawn to each other. It will not be long before Saraswati finds out that Kedarnath is a fraud, will give up on him, and get ready to marry a wealthy Bhagalpur-based man of her father's choice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123870</url></doc>
