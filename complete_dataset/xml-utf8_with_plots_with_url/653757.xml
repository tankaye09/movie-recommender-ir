<plot>Seventy-five days before Saddam Hussein was captured by the U.S. Army, an Iraqi-Canadian filmmaker tries to re-enter his homeland after 27 years of forced exile. In Jordan, he meets other Iraqis who are no longer able to cross the border: workers without jobs, truckers, cab drivers and anxious refugees. Worn down by years of war, sanctions, arbitrary arrests, torture and fear of execution, the men angrily recall the darkest years of the fallen regime. Still stunned by the course of events and uncertain about the future, they have no faith in the Americans, whom they believe are out for their oil. "Are we another Palestine?" asks one of them. Shot in the thick of the action amid the ongoing chaos, the film allows Iraqis to voice their opinions and give their version of things.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653757</url></doc>
