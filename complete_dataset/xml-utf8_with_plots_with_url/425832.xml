<plot>An old man still struggles with losing his beloved wife 10 years earlier, and he writes her a letter confessing to his part in an accidental tragedy that happened decades before, for which he has never taken responsibility. A middle aged woman returns to town after her mother's death to deal with her mother's possessions, feeling guilty about the fact that they weren't close, and still haunted by a long ago loss. Both persons are drawn to a roadside memorial marker on a lonely dirt road which marks the spot of an incident that deeply affected their lives and happiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425832</url></doc>
