<plot>This made-for-tv documentary treats 80's film fans to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Up the Creek, a comedy in the tradition of Animal House and Porky's about a group of goof-off college students who enter a whitewater rafting race while still pursuing girls and beer. Includes interviews with the cast and crew of the film who share their experiences from working on the project, as well as discuss the special efforts that went into bringing it to completion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574213</url></doc>
