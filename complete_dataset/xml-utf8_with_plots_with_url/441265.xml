<plot>Long thought to have been purified by Zordon's energy wave at the end of _"Power Rangers in Space" (1998)_ (qv), the dastardly Lord Zedd has reappeared in his old form. Concealed in a hidden dimension, he is interfering with the time stream, trying to alter the course of history to destroy every Power Ranger throughout time! Operating from the Halls of Legends, the new Omega Ranger must gather a force of Power Rangers and artifacts from across time to break through into Lord Zedd's hidden dimension and restore the timeline! Nintendo DS Emperor Grumm has set his sights upon the myth of the Hall of Legends, the resting place of the collected energies of Power Rangers across time. In his twisted mind he envisioned a world where his enemy's power is not only stolen, but used to make a living god over all creation. The Omega Ranger, aware of all timelines from within the Hall of Legends, discovers his plan and warns the Power Rangers to stand against it. For should the Hall of Legends fall into Grumm's hands, all would be lost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?441265</url></doc>
