<plot>A deeply emotional family drama set at the time of the Great Depression, around the Wall Street crash in New York City. It relates the fortunes of a European immigrant family during one of the hardest times America has ever seen, and centres around the return of the main character, Roberto Biasutti, to the home he left as a child. He is confronted by the tragic events that have happened to his family since: the suicide of his father and the uncertain fate of his mother. The film closes at the end of Roberto's life, giving us both the chronicle of a man's days and a poetic, melancholic arc.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666043</url></doc>
