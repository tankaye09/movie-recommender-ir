<plot>Next to the ferry at Benecia, Calif., this is the largest ferry boat in the world. Timing our approach with the camera mounted on a swiftly moving car, we reach the end of the track just as the mammoth ferry boat enters the slip. It is carrying a twelve coach passenger train, and the passengers are seen moving about and waving as the boat comes to a standstill immediately in front of our instrument.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284855</url></doc>
