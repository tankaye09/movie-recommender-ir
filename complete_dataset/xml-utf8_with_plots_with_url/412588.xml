<plot>Short and sweet Big Brother-like portrait of rock &amp; roll legend Kevin Coyne. With Kevin Coyne and no one else. An experiment in the literal sense of the word. The legendary British rock-and-roll musician Kevin Coyne is an exponent of the theory that a single person only needs one room in which to live. At the filmmaker's request, Coyne spent the night in a room while being permanently filmed. Coyne does not hide his thoughts, improvises on his guitar and fights against sleep and boredom; all this shown in corroded black &amp; white.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412588</url></doc>
