<plot>In the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, USA medal winners Tommy Smith and John Carlos stood on the victory podium in silent protest during the national Anthem. Each bowed their head and raised a gloved fist in support of oppressed people around the world. This led to their ejection from the US Track and Field team and years of fighting prejudice by those who misunderstood the act to be anti-American. Forty years later to the day of that event, Smith and Carlos returned to Mexico City and the Olympic Stadium. This documentary remembers the heartache both men and their families have endured. The film culminates with both men being reunited in the Olympic stadium and facing their emotional place in history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461730</url></doc>
