<plot>From Emmy[TM] Award-winning producer and director Michael Fitzer comes "Into the Lighthouse," an eye-opening, sometimes brutal documentary about teens walking a tightrope of self-destruction. This rare and uncensored look inside the secret world of drug addiction management focuses on day-to-day life inside one of Kentucky's only adolescent drug and alcohol treatment centers. From 17-year old Josh who will do anything to leave the center and begin using drugs again to 16-year old Tate who struggles desperately to stay out of jail, these kids make sure their voices are heard and their experiences are understood. Using candid one-on-one interviews and cinema verite style... "Into the Lighthouse" takes an extraordinary look inside some of the most sensitive adolescent treatment methods in use today. In addition, the overall film illustrates with raw veracity, the affects of drug and alcohol abuse on America's youth population. 2000 Â© Blackfish Films, LLC</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267548</url></doc>
