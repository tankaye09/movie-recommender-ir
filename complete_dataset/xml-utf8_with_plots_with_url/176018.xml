<plot>For three days each year, Parkes, in central NSW, hosts the Elvis Revival Festival - by far and away the biggest of its kind in Australia. This is despite the fact that the King probably never even heard of the tiny rural town. But that was no excuse for the motley crew that made up the festival committee. Indeed, the threat of bushfires, floods, public ridicule, community indifference, financial loss, theft, incompetence and outright exhaustion were never going to overcome this band of devotees. They were determined to build the best bloody birthday celebration for Elvis this country has ever seen. After 13 difficult years it seems they've done it. None other than Elvis Aaron Presley (or at least someone who looks a lot like him) takes us back through the years of struggle to relive, with the key players, the events that made this unlikely festival possible.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176018</url></doc>
