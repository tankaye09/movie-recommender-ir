<plot>Set in the dramatic landscape of Western Australia, Dirt Music tells the story of Luther Fox, a broken man who makes his living as an illegal fisherman -- a amateur. Before everyone in his family was killed in a freak rollover, Fox grew melons and counted stars and loved playing his guitar. Now, his life has become a "project of forgetting." Not until he meets Georgie Jutland, the wife of White Point's most prosperous fisherman, does Fox begin to dream again and hear the dirt music -- "anything you can play on a veranda or porch," he tells Georgie, "without electricity." Like the beat of a barren heart, nature is never silent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151118</url></doc>
