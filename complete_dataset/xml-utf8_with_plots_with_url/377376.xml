<plot>Willy Verhulst is an always good-tempered young girl. She gets along with just about everybody. She loves her father, who she calls Frits, is fond of butler Johan and immediately becomes friends with Alfred Herder at the hospital, where her father is taken. He works for the national radio. There's only person who she despises, Mrs. Baalman, assistant manager of her school. He is the history teacher, one of the subjects that Willy isn't very good at. In fact, she is struggling at school and, since it's her last year she needs to pass her final exam. It's almost not possible to get a job without the certificate. Frits also has problems. His health is declining and he refuses to see a doctor. When his condition rapidly deteriorates, Willy orders him to go to the hospital. It's too late, and her father suddenly dies. Willy still manages to graduate, and starts looking for a job. No one wants her however. Then she remembers Alfred Herder.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377376</url></doc>
