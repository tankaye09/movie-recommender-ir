<plot>Jane heads to the country in search of a new life. Her car breaks down in a small town, and in the local diner where she takes refuge is offered a lift to make her appointment to see an old house she wants to fix up. Jane and Lyle ride out to the house, and become friendly, until reaching their destination. Lyle ties Jane up and leaves her in the house, where a waitress from the diner returns later and reveals her dark, supernatural secret. The town is a trap and all the locals are in on a scheme to lure people out to the house and use them to propel their thirst for new life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088458</url></doc>
