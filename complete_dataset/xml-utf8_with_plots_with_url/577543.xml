<plot>"The Most Important Person" was a series of 66 short subjects for children that related, through animation, live-action, and music, important topics in a youngster's life. The subjects in this series dealt with, for example, dental health, friendship, trying new things, making mistakes, and caring for others. There was a group of animated children that was regularly featured, among them Mike, a boy who always wore a baseball cap; Cindy, a red-haired girl (also called Nancy in a few of the shorts); Nicola, an African-American girl who wore beaded pigtails; and Pablo, a Mexican boy. There was also Fumble, a green, ostrich-like bird; Hairy, a short, furry caveman-like creature; and Bird, who talked fast and was very excited.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577543</url></doc>
