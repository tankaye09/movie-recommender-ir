<plot>Myron works the late-shift at a run down crematory. He is there all night. In the dead. Burning body after body, Myron has grown numb to death... and life. One lonely night, Myron takes in Lucia, a beautiful young woman who has passed away all too soon. As Myron prepares her body for cremation, something about her begins to get under his skin. He's drawn to her like a moth to a flame. Late in the night, he breaks down. Myron steals a kiss and more from the defenseless Lucia. Pained with regret, he quickly finishes his work and burns her body. That was that. It was just a slip. Nobody got hurt. Unfortunately for Myron, Lucia does not the dark. By himself. The rules of the living have been long forgotten and comfort is found amongst feel the same.</plot><plot>Myron works the late-shift at a run down crematory. He is there all night. In the dead.
