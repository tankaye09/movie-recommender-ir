<plot>Dhaniram is a very wealthy man who would like to expand his business into a multi-storied hotel. The only problem is that the proposed hotel is located on a section of land that is occupied by some slum dwellers. All of Dhaniram's efforts to vacate the land have been in vain, as the dwellers are united by two men, Rana and Raka - both inseparable friends. Dhaniram recruits another dweller, Abdul, to find out their weaknesses and exploit them. Abdul meets with Raka and convinces him that Rana has been eying Farida and Raka's girlfriend, Aruna. Raka disbelieves him, but eventually sees Rana with Farida and then subsequently with Aruna in very intimate positions. Raka accuses and beats up Rana, but is unable to convince the other dwellers, as a result Raka leaves the slum and goes to work for Dhaniram. With Raka leaving the slum, the dwellers now only have Rana to protect their interests, and the question remains will Rana be able to protect them from being exploited by Raka and Dhaniram?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152976</url></doc>
