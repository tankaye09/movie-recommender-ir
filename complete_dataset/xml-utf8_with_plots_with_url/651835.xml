<plot>Three teenage girls decide to throw a party to introduce their college-student friend Steve to the crowd. However, instead of just calling up friends &amp; inviting them over--a bad idea, according to this film--the party must be organized to the last degree, with everything from refreshments to entertainment planned out in exacting detail (spontaneity is no fun, apparently). On the day of the party, a good time is had by all because of the "planning and skill" exhibited by the girls while setting up the party.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651835</url></doc>
