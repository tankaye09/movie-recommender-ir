<plot>Rajesh and Savitri are in love, and soon they get married. They soon realize that they have a number of differences, the main one being that while Rajesh is a devout Hindu and worships Lord Krishna, Savitri does not believe in God. This leads to a number of arguments, yet both continue on with their married life. Soon a child is born to them. Unfortunately, the child is born without hands and legs. Both are anguished by this, and decide to placate God by visiting various places of worship all over India, little knowing that the truth lies elsewhere.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349812</url></doc>
