<plot>Canada's first truly orginal satirical series. Built a solid college audience during it's four year run both in Canada and the border cities of Detroit and Buffalo. Started as a local Toronto show on the CBC then was shown across the country. Became popular for it's anti war stance and it's use of sparsely clad actresses. It featured topical Canadian comedy long before SCTV and Kids in the Hall.It's only writer Chris Bearde went on to become one of the original 13 Emmy winning writers on NBC's smash hit comedy series "Laugh In".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396351</url></doc>
