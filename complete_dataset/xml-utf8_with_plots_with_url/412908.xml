<plot>A typical mid-30s entry from the Maury M. Cohen Invincible arm of Chesterfield Pictures, shot in the usual static style of Frank R. Strayer who moved the camera maybe twice for a medium close-up, probably under orders not to from producer Cohen who knew moving the camera cost time and money. This one has good-girl Dorothy Brooks being summoned to the apartment of her department store boss, Mr. Dickman, who accuses her of stealing lingerie from the store, but if she will be nice and kiss him, he won't turn her in. She shoves him away and he tumbles (off-camera, of course) out of the second story window. Dorothy flees with the aid of her friend, Kitty Kennedy, and she soon encounters Donald Cabot, Jr. who, unknown to her, is the son of the department store owner. He, of course, also doesn't know she is an employee of his father's store wanted for assault and theft. No surprises from this point to the happy ending. Dickman, the cad, naturally turns out to be the lingerie thief.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412908</url></doc>
