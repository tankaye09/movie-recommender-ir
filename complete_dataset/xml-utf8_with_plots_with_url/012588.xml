<plot>The Jewish entertainer Al Jolson died in 1950. The film tries to find out what is left of his success over 55 years after his death. Is the man who once made the movies talk, and who paved the way for entertainers like Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, forgotten or remembered? Fourty years after the 1960s the film tries to start a dialogue about this performer, who is today mostly known for using the 'blackface' mask, if he is known at all. The film focuses on the American public view on Al Jolson, and looks back to the American cultural and political past in order to explain Jolson's image today. This view takes place against the Al Jolson Way Inauguration on New York's Broadway in August of 2006.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012588</url></doc>
