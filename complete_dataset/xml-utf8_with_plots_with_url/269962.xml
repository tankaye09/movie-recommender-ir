<plot>It Might Be You is about a guy who meets the girl he was destined to be with. Scott Cruz lives a comfortable life with a loving family, a few good friends, and a film making hobby that he's passionate about. But there is something missing in his life. A look back at old high school English journals ask the question about love and finding the one person who defines what true love truly is. On the very same day, Scott bumps into a girl who might be the answer to that question. Claire Hodges is a well respected theater student and a talented aspiring actress with a lot going for her. Although having a father who is MIA and dealing with an ever worrying mother on a regular basis, she tries to live with a positive attitude. After meeting Scott, Claire finds the balance in her life that she's been looking for. .</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269962</url></doc>
