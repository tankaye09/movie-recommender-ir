<plot>Ali Manigat, originally from Cornwall, Ontario, attends school at New York City's prestigious Columbia University, and for years has balanced his unfulfilling career as a member of their losing football team with his uncertain professional future. With brutal honesty, he confronts his inability to gain a starting position on the offensive line, the reality that he plays back-up to his identical twin brother, the friendships that have sustained him throughout college, and the bodily damage that he has suffered for a sport that has given him very little back. For Ali, he must cope with leaving behind football, and let the rest of his life begin.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413344</url></doc>
