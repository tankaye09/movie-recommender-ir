<plot>Every aspect of running a small Hot Dog stand (and ultimately a thriving empire) is incorporated into this light-hearted simulation. Design your stores based on what your customers tell you they like. Staff relations play a big role in the game. Each potential employee has their own personality, and can be offered gifts, improved training and vacation time, all of which will have an affect on the quality of their work. Designing the staff costume also has a big effect on how marketable your store is. It's not always peaceful work; you will face robberies, infestations of viruses, and even aliens. A boxing mini-game sees you deal with angry customers, while you can run your company outside of the law, with the help of the Mafia for espionage and intimidation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246942</url></doc>
