<plot>On September 30, 2006 the M.E.S.A. Program at Southwestern College held its annual Walk on Water Competition. Students and members of the community were invited to participate. The challenge was to create shoes that would allow a person to walk on water. Awards were given in three categories: fastest shoes, most recycled materials used, and most creative shoes. This year's competition attracted several teams from La Jolla High School, and a team from Southwestern College. The competitors faced several challenges from late arrivals to the possibility of being disqualified. Whose shoes would prove to be most effective?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?646377</url></doc>
