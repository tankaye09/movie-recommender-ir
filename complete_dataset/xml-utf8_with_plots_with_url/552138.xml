<plot>It's Christmas 1986 in small town Canada and the only thing 6-year-old Curtis Harrison wants is the "Yeddy Sasquatch 2000". Unfortunately, by the time his Mom finds out, "Yeddymania" has hit every store in the Niagara Region and the Yeddy Sasquatch cannot be found. Now, more than ever, Curtis (accompanied by his best friends, Rex the dog and He-man) must outwit his blackmailing, conniving, and evil older brother, Daryl, so that Santa will come with his beloved toy. While figuring out the inner workings of the Welland toy mafia, Curtis raises endless questions: Will Santa come if Daryl makes me do bad things? Is mom a robot? And who egged our house last night? "The Day Santa Didn't Come" is a story of a family and all of their lovable faults, the dearly dysfunctional lives in small-town Canada and of the little guy overcoming it all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?552138</url></doc>
