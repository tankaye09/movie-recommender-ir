<plot>After a loss of her fianc√©, a woman is distraught. Remembering the good times spent writing together a novel, she hears strange noises in the attic. Something is coming. She decides to go to the attic, to check out the source of the sound by herself. Scared by a strange mist the woman runs back to her room, just in time to realize that there has been somebody there. She can sense it, though she can not see it. It does not help as she locks herself inside the room. There is someone beside her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406400</url></doc>
