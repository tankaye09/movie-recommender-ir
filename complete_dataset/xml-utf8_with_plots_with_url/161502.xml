<plot>The theme of this story is to look at how women will behave in an extreme situation and murder is as extreme as you can get. Will they join forces or lock horns.          Two women who have been lifelong friends have found themselves in a situation where they are both independently involved but inextricably linked to the brutal murder of one of their husbands. In this crescendo of tension, distrust and suspicion we examine how two very different personalities deal with this trauma. Violet is rich and beautiful but lives with her head in the clouds whereas Charlize is very practical, level headed and broke.  They have a love for each other and an envy of each other. In this spiders web of intrigue, blackmail and murder, the two of them have to go through a whole range of emotions from tears to laughter, from sharing fond memories to viscous jealousy and spite. In this search for a murderer we will see how the bond between them is tested and see how, if at all, their relationship can continue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161502</url></doc>
