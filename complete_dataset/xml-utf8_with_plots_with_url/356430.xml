<plot>Tamio Moroi graduates from a prestigious university and obtains a job at the Camel Brewery in a distant town. He is keen to work hard, but is warned to take it easy and just appear as if he were working. He receives a letter from his father saying that his mother is going crazy. After hiring a psychiatric student from his university to investigate his mother, she comes to visit him to tell him that it is really his father that is going insane. His university girlfriend, Miss Iki, visits him in his bleak dorm, after losing her teaching job, but he cannot afford to marry her. A while later Tamio loses his job, due to a series of odd ailments. Finally he obtains work as a school janitor, and meets Miss Iki again in the unemployment line, but finds that she is now married - to a janitor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356430</url></doc>
