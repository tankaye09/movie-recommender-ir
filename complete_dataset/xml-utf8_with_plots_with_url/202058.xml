<plot>Two men, locked in a cheap hotel room together with little else but a video camera, struggle to pass the time. Nobody knows who they are or why they're there. The maid thinks they're lovers. The party girl next door thinks they're filmmakers. The truth is far more provocative. As questions of power, politics, and intertwining identities emerge, just who is controlling whom is thrown increasingly into doubt. Whang Cheol Mean, a veteran of the Korean independent film scene, has crafted an intensely engaging film that seems deceptively simple, unfolding to reveal a world of unfathomable complexities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202058</url></doc>
