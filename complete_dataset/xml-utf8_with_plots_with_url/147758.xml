<plot>An old man travels to an unknown mountain destination inside a tiny, weathered and rusty cable car. During the ride, the old man treats himself to a good portion of snuff. When he sneezes heartily, the old gondola swings precariously. Later, the rhythmic sound of the wheels transporting the gondola upwards lulls the old man into slumber. But soon after, there is a new tickle in his nose, and he puts some more snuff on the back of his hand. One sneeze attack follows the other, and soon, the cabin's once solid walls start falling apart, more with every attack. Now the rump of the cable car ascends to dizzying heights, mercilessly exposed to onslaughts of rain and snow. The old man, however, is far from inclined to accept such fate. Rather, he is quick to devise a new kind of cabin with his roll of sticky tape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?147758</url></doc>
