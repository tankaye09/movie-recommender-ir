<plot>Across his three decades at Ohio State, Woody Hayes dominated the football landscape and spread the virtues and tradition of the Buckeyes from coast to coast. This new film is a tribute to the man who embodied the spirit of the Scarlet and Gray through hard work, intellect, leadership, inspiration, and character. 205 wins at Ohio State, three national championships, and 13 Big Ten titles only begin to measure Hayes' accomplishments, his lasting legacy, and the remarkable impact of his core beliefs on Ohio State, are celebrated and honored here. Hayes' creation of a national football powerhouse helped fill Buckeye Grove with All-Americans, but on and off the field Coach Hayes built champions. From his start at OU, to the "Ten Year War" between the Buckeyes and Wolverines for top-rank bragging rights, through to his retirement, the stories of Coach Hayes are told by players, colleagues, and friends including Archie Griffin, Rex Kern, Dick Schafrath, Jack Tatum, John Hicks and other Buckeye greats.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660558</url></doc>
