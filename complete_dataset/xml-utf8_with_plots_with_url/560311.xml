<plot>Frank McGlynn, Sr. plays a rabid fan who, upon learning that the Giants and White Sox are going to tour the world, decides to join them. The film is an odd combination of straight documentary and comedy. At least once McGlynn is helped into the ballpark by noted baseball flake "Germany" Schaefer. Among the highlights were a filmed race between "Hans" Lobert and a race horse in Oxnard, California and Jim Thorpe wrestling Fred Merkle on the floor of the Colosseum in Rome. The film was made during the Giants and White Sox world tour of 1913-1914. During the tour the two teams played games on four continents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?560311</url></doc>
