<plot>Life is a bottle full of liquid years that run by quickly when you drink too much and too quickly. But the precious nectar disappears even when you hold the glass away. It evaporates flow because of the cork was lost during children's games. The hell of the contemporary Orpheus is the wait for a death that is known. It is the awareness that one cannot take in any more memories. The temptation to give up is strong. The sirens of sloth seem to be able to break even the chains of love. The modern Orpheus chooses not to lose his Euridice, his companion, and to follow him down even to hell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415409</url></doc>
