<plot>Latif Yahia, an Iraqi Army lieutenant stationed on the Iranian border, bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil incarnate, Uday Hussein. Latif is summoned to Saddam Hussein's inner sanctum where he is given a choice: become the body double of Saddam's sadistic son Uday, or die. The Devil's Double is the fascinating story of Latif Yahia and his remarkable life as the double of Iraq's most reviled individual. The Devil's Double provides unique insight into a closed society revealing the horrors of Saddam's tyrannical regime from the inside while providing a chilling portrait of the man whom many considered to be Saddam's heir apparent. The film is based on the life story of Latif Yahia and his bestselling novels The Devil's Double and I was Saddam's Son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553135</url></doc>
