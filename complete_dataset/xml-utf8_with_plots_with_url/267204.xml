<plot>After struggling with drug addiction for 17 years and making it through recovery, Ricky and Melba McGee are determined to use their experiences to help other addicts get clean. In this debut episode, the residents of Intervention House are on an emotional edge when 30 year-old crack addict "Brenda" disappears; newly-arrived cocaine addict "Russ" reveals a secret about the depths to which his addicted girlfriend has fallen; and chronic alcoholic "Cheryl" moves in after drinking mouth wash and blacking-out. Melba also faces a personal crisis when she attempts to reunite with her gay son after more than a year of estrangement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267204</url></doc>
