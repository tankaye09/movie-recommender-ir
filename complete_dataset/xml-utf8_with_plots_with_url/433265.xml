<plot>During a terrible storm, an alligator couple at the city zoo expect the stork to bring them a baby, but the stork gets so panicked by the wind and lightning, that he reads the address wrong, so the panther gets the baby instead. As one could expect, the panther has constant trouble with the infant who keeps snapping at his tail and complaining about hunger. While they're out walking, the little alligator escapes from the baby carriage and finds his parents in the zoo, but the panther doesn't want to part with the baby until the stork arrives to clear up the situation. The panther walks home totally saddened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433265</url></doc>
