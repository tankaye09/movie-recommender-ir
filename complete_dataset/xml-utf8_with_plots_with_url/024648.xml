<plot>Jeremy Titus seems to have it all, a secure job and an award for employee of the month, a handsome face, a good body, and a concerned mother. The one thing he doesn't have is the love of a woman, particularly Eleanor, his co-worker. There is another problem with Jeremy as well, he has a Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde personality split. Jeremy is friendly at work, yet at night succumbs to his necrophiliac desires by picking up prostitutes and killing them, leaving their bodies in his house and giving them post-mortem affection.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024648</url></doc>
