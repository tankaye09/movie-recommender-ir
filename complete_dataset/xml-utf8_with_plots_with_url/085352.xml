<plot>When the stagecoach in which they travel is attacked by Monteiro's gang, Lash accepts to kill his friend to save his bacon. On reaching his destination - a village near the Mexican border where he is to take possession of a gold mine, he realizes that he has a neighbor, old Johnny, who owns a farm and another gold mine. He immediately sets about making his life miserable, hoping to drive him from the country and lay hands on his possessions. Lash soon becomes the undisputed master of the area, at least until Buckaroo, a wild horse tamer, arrives in town.The young man accepts to work for Johnny and, when his boss is killed in an ambush, starts gathering men with a view to fighting back Lash's army, reinforced by Monteiro and his men, who have resurfaced. After many adventures, Buckaroo gets rid of both Monteiro and Lash, in whom he has recognized the cowardly murderer of his own father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085352</url></doc>
