<plot>An over-crowded bus in rush-hour traffic is no-ones idea of fun, but that's just the beginning of Gaz's problems. With the mobile phone abuse at a high, he can't help but get a little fidgety.

But it shouldn't be too long, they should be moving in no time. If he can just hold on a little longer. Too late!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114100</url></doc>
