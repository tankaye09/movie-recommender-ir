<plot>Richard Crenna introduces the film, "Made in Paris," by introducing his character, a fashion reporter, and the film's wardrobe. He takes us first to a fashion show, then introduces us to the film's costume designer, Helen Rose. She shows him sketches of dresses worn in the picture by Ann-Margaret and Edie Adams. We then see Ann-Margaret's wardrobe test. Crenna asks Rose to comment on the age-old question, do women dress for other women? Rose's answer is an emphatic no: she demonstrates with several scenes from the film in which Ann-Margaret's clothes are designed to catch and hold men's eyes. We see her with Chad Everett, Louis Jordan, and Crenna himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350969</url></doc>
