<plot>Five very different New York perspectives of the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center bombings in the months directly following the attack. A Christian Lebanese family from Queens who, in October 2001, still believed there was a chance of their day trader son being found trapped in the rubble. An African American, Yale graduate and descendant of slaves who gets his big career break reporting live from the scene of the attack for FOX news. An Irish American firefighter and musician who sang at hundreds of firefighter funerals for the three months following the attack. An ex-police officer and Desert Storm veteran helps strangers escape the scene and battles depression in the aftermath. A young medical doctor who escaped the communist Czech Republic as a lone teenager with less than $100 and worked her way through college and medical school ran to the scene to help survivors and ends up spending days assisting in the make-shift morgue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159657</url></doc>
