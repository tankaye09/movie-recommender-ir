<plot>A woman, her body, and the destructive voice that controls her. The story is about individual power in the wrong hands. Ina needs to get her power back from Joy who has taken it. This intense and raw confrontation is shot in 35mm, entirely in black and white, with both players naked. The nudity is non-erotic and allows the audience to experience the characters' extreme circumstances of primitive vulnerability and privacy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336927</url></doc>
