<plot>A tragic story about Caim, a knight, whose parents were killed by the evil Empire. During the battle as he fights off the Empire's knights, Caim is badly injured from an enemy attack and as he proceeds to a castle, he encounters a Red Dragon who is badly injured as well. With Caim and the Red Dragon in a near-death situation, Caim must force the Red Dragon to form a pact with each other in order for their wounds to heal and survive or they both will die. After Caim formed a pact with the Red Dragon, they wounds are healed. Unfortunately, it cost Caim his voice (verbal communication) for the pact price. With Caim (now mute) and the Red Dragon teaming up to stop the war, they will meet other allies like Leonard who formed a pact with the Faerie costing his sight (seeing things) for the pact price. The second one is Arioch who formed a pact with Undine and Salamander costing her womb (self-behavior control) for the pact price. The third is Seere who formed a pact with the Golem costing his time (to grow older) for the pact price. Other non-playable characters that Caim will meet will also have formed a pact as well like Verdelet who sacrificed his hair (growing hair on the head) for the pact price with the dragon who is now petrified. And then there is Inuart, Caim's old friend who sacrificed his song (ability to play and like music) for the pact price with the evil dragon. More tragic events will take place while Caim and the Red Dragon fight the evil empire. Will they succeed in bringing an end to the Empire?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158834</url></doc>
