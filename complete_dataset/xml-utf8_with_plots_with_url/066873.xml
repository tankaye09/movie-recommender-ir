<plot>Featuring the vintage films, and pictures that made her a phenomenon, BETTIE PAGE, THE GIRL IN THE LEOPARD PRINT BIKINI, focuses on the life and times of the legendary model, the times in which she lived, and the impact her career had on the subsequent fifty years. Though her days as a photographer's model and actress are over, and her time in the spotlight relatively brief, the young girl from Tennessee is more popular than ever. Bonus Footage: This program includes uncut versions of some of Bettie's best films from the 1950's. These rare and valuable films are shown in their entirety from the best prints available. Thought to be lost for many years, now you can own them in your very own collection.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066873</url></doc>
