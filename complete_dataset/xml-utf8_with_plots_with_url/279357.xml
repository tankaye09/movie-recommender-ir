While Rajesh is poor, and lives all by himself, Kalpana comes from a wealthy family, and her dad, Shyamlal wants her to marry the son of Girdharilal. Opposed to this marriage, Kalpana runs away to Rajesh, and soon both get married at the Registrar of Marriages. This engrages her dad all the more, and he refuses to have to do anything with his daughter, disowning her. Kalpana and Rajesh settle down, and soon are proud parents of a boy. Kalpana has kept in touch with her mother, and has bragged to her that they are both well-off, her husband is now in a supervisory position, and they own a large bunglow and a car.
