<plot>Don Miller hates his job. Seems like a common enough malady in today's society... Only Don doesn't live in today's society. In the not-too-distant future, Don's profession (telemarketing) has taken on a whole new dimension. Now salesmen appear holographically in the homes of potential buyers. While the technology has advanced, the amount of respect that goes along with the job certainly hasn't. All it takes is one particularly bad day to push Don to rebel against his soul-crushing daily grind as he tries desperately to salvage some dignity in a world that seems hell-bent on kicking a man when he's down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151715</url></doc>
