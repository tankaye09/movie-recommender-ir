<plot>Abandoned at birth at the Kasturba Annarthalay by her father, Gangulal, due to her gender, Anuradha grows up, and feels rejected when she is by-passed for adoption. When she grows up, she becomes a social worker, coming to the assistance of needy people. Once while assisting an accident victim, she hitches a ride from the Managing Director of GK Constructions, Gaurav Khanna, who is impressed by her, hires her as his Personal Secretary, and also provides transportation as well as accommodation. Anuradha soon makes herself indispensable, and falls in love with him. He instead humiliates her several times forcing her to tender her resignation. Gaurav then advertises for a vacancy, hires a beautiful and smart woman, Shruti, and asks Anuradha to train her during her 30 day notice period. At the end of this period, Anuradha confesses her love to Gaurav and this is when she will find out that Gaurav is already married to Sanjana, whose parents, Sumitra and Vishwanath, live in Malaysia, and that Shruti has a secret agenda of her own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080206</url></doc>
