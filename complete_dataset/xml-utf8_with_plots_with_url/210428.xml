<plot>Known for his personification of the Western Hero, it was Montana-born Cooper's horse-riding skills that first brought him bit parts in movies. And he never lost his love of the great American outdoors. Though he rarely played a villain and was an adept comedian, Cooper is best remembered for his strong, silent heroes. With his lanky countryboy looks and shy hesitancy he created a unique screen presence, though his real life was one of sophisticated elegance. Over 100 movies brought him three Academy Award Nominations and two Academy Awards. Cooper's most memorable films include A Farewell to Arms, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, Meet John Doe, The Pride of the Yankees and High Noon. Daughter Maria Cooper Janis and actors George C. Scott, Charlton Heston, Patricia Neal and Joan Leslie are among those appearing in this profile of one of Hollywood's greatest stars.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210428</url></doc>
