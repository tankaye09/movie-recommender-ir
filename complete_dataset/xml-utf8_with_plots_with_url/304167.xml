<plot>Erika, a young married woman from Romania, suddenly comes to terms with a dreadful past experience that will always remain with her. She must try not to break down before Elena, her child. It is the baby's innocent questions that revive her past torment and evoke the image of Giovanni, a nasty and rude Apulian slave dealer, and his merciless gang master Michele. The audience witnesses a double story. A tragic one, in which Erika lives once again what she had already experienced some years earlier, when she ran away from Romania and was sucked into the cruel whirl of illegal work in the Italian tomato fields, and a fairylike one, in which Elena asks her mother to tell her a bedtime story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?304167</url></doc>
