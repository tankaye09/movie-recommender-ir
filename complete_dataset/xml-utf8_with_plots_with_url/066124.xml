<plot>In order to prevent honest Ramchandra from being elected as Mayor, Digvijay Singh alias Dharamdas sets his men upon him, his son, Ram Kumar, and his wife, all in vain, as Ramchandra wins. Shortly after his election, Ramchandra is framed and is forced to quit office after a scandal, and he hangs himself. Ram, his mom, and his sister, Chanda, re-locate and are not heard from again. Then a young man, Prince Chandrashekar from Johanneburg, South Africa, surfaces, claims he is a multi-millionaire, and would like to go into business with Digvijay Singh. This Prince also meets with Digvijay's sister and friend, Renuka, and Manju respectively and has an on-going affair with both at the same time. Digvijay is not happy with what's going on, and he asks his men to investigate the background of this Prince, and what they find will change Digvijay's life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066124</url></doc>
