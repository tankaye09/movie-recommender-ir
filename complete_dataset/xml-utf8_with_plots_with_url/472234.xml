<plot>The narrative unfolds from the point-of-view of a single character named Roach. As part of the filmmaking process, he's been given a camera to document his world. The footage he gets is urgent, because there's a war against squeegee kids. This documentary is from the point of view of the kids themselves, in order to provide alternative voices. Roach's camera is positioned behind "enemy" lines: living in derelict buildings, squeegeeing for money, being hunted by police. The viewer is forced to look at the living reality of Roach and his friends: Hungry on the streets in one of the world's most prosperous countries-considered thugs, criminals, and enemies. This film shatters the windshield between Us and Them. Roach's camera acts as the hammer: hard, forceful, direct; impacting with the force of an actual life. Cross's camera documents the impact: recording the reflections of individual lives, mirrored upon the shards of flying glass.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472234</url></doc>
