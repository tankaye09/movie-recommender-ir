<plot>When Bridget and Franklin take a road trip to rekindle their troubled relationship, they're inadvertently plunged into a nightmare of hidden identities and sexual mind games. Caught in a blinding snowstorm, they lose control of their car and run off the road. Lost in the night and in danger of freezing to death, the two are left with no choice but to abandon their car and seek shelter in a deserted hunting lodge. But they soon discover that they are not alone. Another man is there - a Frenchman, and only Bridget speaks French. His presence ignites Franklin's jealousy and soon the sexual tension has risen to the breaking point. The couple's relationship begins to unravel into a deadly game of cat and mouse as paranoia, fear, and violence spiral out of control, leaving them wondering if they can ever escape from Terror Lodge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619883</url></doc>
