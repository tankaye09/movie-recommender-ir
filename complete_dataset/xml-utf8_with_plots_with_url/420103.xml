<plot>Using archival news footage, Esfir Shub pieces together a chronology of Russia, from 1913 to 1917. She introduces leaders of the Duma, gentry and peasants, soldiers and sailors, the bourgeoisie, and the Czar. In May of 1913, Europe's crowned heads come to Petrograd to celebrate 300 years of Romanov rule even as most of them prepare for war. As war erupts, so does Russia: strikes in Petrograd and marches in Moscow threaten the regime. The Duma tries to survive, seeking accommodation with the Soviets. March 4, 1917, Nicholas abdicates; March 27, a mass funeral in Petrograd for those who died in the struggle to bring down the Romanovs; then, Lenin returns from exile.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420103</url></doc>
