<plot>This event broke new ground in international entertainment. It took 10 of the world's most popular stars and cast them in unique duets, trios and quartets to sing the greatest hits of the previous 40 years. The show went backwards in time from 1996 to 1956 choosing one song per year as it went. Each year was then introduced by iconic images of the year of the song. The show was sponsored by Carlsberg as part of its 150th anniversary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506846</url></doc>
