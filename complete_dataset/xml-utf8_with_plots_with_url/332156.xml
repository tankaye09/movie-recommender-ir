<plot>A very comical picture, depicting two burglars who have entered the store room of a vineyard, apparently for the purpose of committing burglary. They discover the long line of wine barrels and go about sampling each. They are finally interrupted in their operations by two watchmen. They seize the watchmen, and knocking the heads out of two wine barrels, throw them in head first, leaving the watchmen kicking and squirming endeavoring to get away. A policeman enters and pulling the watchmen out of the barrel, mistakes them for burglars and arrests them, ending as usual, by the victims getting the worst of it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?332156</url></doc>
