<plot>A Korean War film with a secondary plot of the training of South Korean pilots, to fly fighters in air defense, by American Air Force instructors,led by Major Brady, a famed and skilled-but-grounded pilot, assigned to the Kongku base. Once there he meets again Donna Cottrell (Barbara Britton), whom he was about to marry a year ago until she learned that she wasn't the widow she thought she was. Her husband (Bruce Bennett), had been a prisoner and wasn't dead, and showed up before the wedding and more or less put a damper on the whole proceedings. He is the base doctor and also keeps a wary eye on his wife and Brady. Not a bad idea considering the short period of grief she went through, after being informed he was dead, before heading for the altar with Brady. But Bruce Bennet, as was par for the course for characters Bennett usually played, does the right thing and gets himself blown up by an enemy bomb (and is certified real dead this time), thereby ensuring the two top-billed players will end up together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158997</url></doc>
