<plot>Hector returns to Scotland from action in Burma at the end of World War II. On revisiting his haunts he discovers that the glen is to be sold for development as an amusement park. The young girl, Maggie he falls in love with turns out to be the daughter of the local councillor who is in favour of the development. Willthe encouragement of his old teacher, played my Ealing Studios stalwart, Edie Martin, he takes on Maggie's dad at the council election and wins. The message of the film is that eveyone can make a difference in local democracy, and that if the authorities go against the wishes of the electorate, they can be thrown from office.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?561026</url></doc>
