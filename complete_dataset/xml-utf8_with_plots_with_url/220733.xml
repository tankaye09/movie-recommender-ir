<plot>The family relations are about to brake down, when parents don't stop conflicting in the presence of their child, Nusha. The mother's initiative to take care of the family budget by selling beauty goods will be hardly accepted by the father, who plays small roles at the local theatre. Trying to escape from the harsh reality and to solve her problems Nusha invents her own imaginary world where animals and dinosaurs, birds and people sing, dance and fly. At a certain point, Nusha's parents invite Madam Dinosaur to take care of the girl. The Madam succeeds in explaining existential problems to Nusha and their relations warm up. The child includes Madam Dinosaur in her imaginary world. Madam Dinosaur and Nusha are singing their dialogues and the integration of 3D and 2D animation makes the dreams more magical.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220733</url></doc>
