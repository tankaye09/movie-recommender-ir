<plot>Since September 11, 2001, the U.S. military has waged two major wars that ended in quick victories and uneasy peace. Reserve units have been called to serve in record numbers. As these citizen soldiers return home from the front lines, they have incredible stories to tell about their experiences in the line of fire. Based on compelling interviews with reservist soldiers and Marines just back from the front, and brought to life with actual combat footage, CITIZEN SOLDIER reveals the personal triumphs and tragedies of 21st-century combat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107329</url></doc>
