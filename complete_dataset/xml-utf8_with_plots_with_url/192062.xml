<plot>Felix spots a fisherman on his way to his fishing spot, and figures he can follow the guy and grab a quick lunch by stealing his catch. Although he successfully nabs a few fish, the angler catches on and finally captures Felix. To get his revenge, he sends Felix through the telephone wires ("broadcasted") to Egypt, and Felix finds out that the Egyptians don't want him there, either.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192062</url></doc>
