<plot>Ellory Bugs (Willian B. Davidson) has offered a huge donation to his old alma mater, Taylor Tech, which is to be paid only if his son, Jimmie "Doodle" Bugs (Joe Penner), becomes a football hero. But "Doodle" tips the scales at 143 pounds and is more interested in the band than the football team. Janice Martin (June Travis), daughter of the college president (George Irving), is the great thing in "Doodle's" life, but she despises him and has eyes only for Mickey Wells (Alan Bruce), the school football star. "Doodle" is consoled by Professor Minorous (Billy Gilbert), of the Greek Mythology department who tells him that the gods will solve all of his problems, and starts right in to make communications with these worthies by means of countless and meaningless blackboard equations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379625</url></doc>
