<plot>A postman's working day is over before most of us are even up, leaving a lot of time to sit and ponder, to regret lost chances and things that have been left unsaid. In the middle of the day, two friends find themselves drifting into a discussion about the nature of love, prompted by the story of a chance encounter and a love letter that was never sent. A Man of Letters looks at the overlooked, the faceless, uniformed people who hesitate in the background; the people we see every day without noticing. It hovers by their side, allowing us a wry look inside their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012870</url></doc>
