<plot>Speaking on the telephone with the Hungarian Consulate, the filmmaker asks: "Does someone whose grandfather is Hungarian have the right to obtain a Hungarian passport?" The question apparently sounds strange. "Yes - It's possible... But, why do you want a Hungarian passport?" The filmmaker asks for the list of necessary documents, but the officer woman still doesn't understand why she wants to become Hungarian. The idea took place on her mind: she is going to ask for the Hungarian nationality. She didn't say a word to anyone but she wouldn't give it up. The administrative process - the request for a passport - is the guiding line of the film. And the filmmaker faces essential questions: what is nationality? What's the use of a passport? What is our heritage? How do we construct our own history and identity?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?627376</url></doc>
