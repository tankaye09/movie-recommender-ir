<plot>A very cool companion to the hit, notorious film, Blair Witch Project. It's amazing this title got out as quickly as it did, since the movie was a surprise hit. Someone risked it all. It's trailblazing in that much of the content was programmed in various Internet languages, so information could be updated on the fly. Includes tons of resident content on the media too, like biographies of the cast, crew, special interviews, original clips, and lots of other unusual interactive features.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074117</url></doc>
