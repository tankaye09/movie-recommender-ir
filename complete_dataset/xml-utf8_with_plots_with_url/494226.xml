<plot>A most interesting picture, showing several boats laden with passengers passing through the rapids and waving their hats to the audience. In the foreground we see the old wire bridge, well-known to every Irish-born and visited by everybody who travels through Ireland. The boats pass through this bridge. The scenery is one of the most beautiful ever seen, and the picture will make a great hit wherever shown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494226</url></doc>
