<plot>A travel agent Ravi (Sivaji) financially supports his aged mother and crippled sister. When he finds out he has a brain tumor and is expected to die, he crafts an elaborate plan to implicate himself in a murder and have the reward for it delivered to his own family. A remake of a 1974 Amitabh Bachchan film, Majboor, the script is good, but the performances mostly hammy. Early Rajnikant cameo, from the days before Amitabh remakes would feature him as the lead actor!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?387538</url></doc>
