<plot>A new and sensational film, which deals in a highly up-to-date way with the international situation. A magician steps upon the stage carrying a hoop covered with white paper. Then in quick succession the flags of Germany, Russia, Ireland, England and China are brought forth, and from each a soldier is produced corresponding with the flag of each nation. The magician adds a bit of comedy to the scene by producing a decidedly Hibernian policeman from the flag of Erin's Isle. The magician then waves his hand and the flags of all nations slowly dissolve and blend into one huge American flag. The American flag is then dissolved and the military representatives of the nations form a tableau over which is draped their respective flags.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549918</url></doc>
