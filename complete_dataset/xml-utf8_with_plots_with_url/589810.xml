<plot>The story of how Spanish conqueror Cortez, one of Mexican history's most controversial figures, flattened the Aztec nation and plundered its riches with the help of an Aztec princess-turned-slave. Cortez is, in some quarters, considered to be a traitor. Malinali, a slave woman given by an Aztec tribe as a peace offering to the Cortez, became highly valuable to the conquerer when he realized she spoke Spanish as well as the Aztec languages. She became his translator, lover and adviser.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589810</url></doc>
