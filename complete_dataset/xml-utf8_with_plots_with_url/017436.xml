<plot>At a graveside in Salty Lake City, a middle aged American-Iranian surgeon, Kamran Mahdoust, reminisces about his best friend, Reza Radmanesh. As he lives his life with his wife and two children, he remembers his best friend from high school. High school friends in Iran in mid 70s, Reza a rich man's son is spoiled with comfort such as servants, etc. Kamran, his best friend is from a middle class family and they both attend a public school. Their other friends, Sohraab, Syrus, and Mansour are aware of the class difference and some are jealous. Some have plans to go abroad for college; some will stay in Iran. Reza and Kamran come to the U.S. for their college education in 1976, three years before the Iranian Revolution. They don't know how this will change their lives forever. In the course of their college years, they come into contact with other Iranians like Kazem, Mohammad, Vartan, etc., who all come from different backgrounds. Some of them are very active in the political arena. There are Religious Fanatics, Marxists, Maoists, and an array of other factions. Reza's wealth does not help him here either. In 1979, the Iranian Revolution happens. The hard liners take over the country. Reza's Dad, dies in the course of the Revolution. This affects Reza in a big way. It drives him to drugs and alcohol. Reza has nowhere to go. The plans of going back to Iran after graduation have taken a detour for the worse for both of them. Throughout a series of events, the lives of Reza and Kamran take strange twists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017436</url></doc>
