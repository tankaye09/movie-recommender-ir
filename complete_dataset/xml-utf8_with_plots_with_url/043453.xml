<plot>Sidheshwari is the wife of an advocate in Calcutta and lives in a joint family along with her three children; her husband's lazy and wastrel cousin, Chander; his wife, Sheila, and their two children. Sheila runs the financial affairs of this household without any question and keeps on urging her husband to find some work, after he squanders several thousand Rupees in one failed business after another. Things change dramatically when Advocate Harish moves in along with his wife, Naintara and son, Atul. As a result, Sheila, Chander and her children are abused and must leave to move into their house in a village. Shortly after they re-locate, word gets to Harish that Chander has not given up his ways, is squandering money, and even refuses to send any money derived from their farmland. As a result, Harish moves the courts to evict Chander, and also accuse him and Sheila of stealing money and jewelry. Watch what impact this has on the already-strained relations, and the impact this has on their respective children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043453</url></doc>
