Vijay has been literally born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and indulges in life's temptations and weaknesses to the extreme. Vishwanath would like his son to get married and be responsible. Vijay agrees to get married on condition that his future bride sign an agreement that the marriage is on a trial basis for one year, and thereafter is Vijay does not fall in love with her, the marriage gets annulled. Vishwanath asks his personal assistant, Megha, to quit her job and marry Vijay, but Megha refuses. Megha comes from a poor family, consisting of her mom, two other sisters, and one brother. Megha reconsiders this offer, and asks for financial support for her mom and siblings, to which Vishwanath agrees to, and as a result Vijay and Megha are married. After the marriage, Vijay and Megha do become friends, and Megha goes out of her way to look after Vijay when he meets with an accident. At the end of the year, however, Vijay decides to annul the marriage, as had been agreed upon. Megha leaves Vijay and returns home.
