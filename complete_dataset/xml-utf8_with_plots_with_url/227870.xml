<plot>"Halloween Ghost Story" is a short film about a group of four friends, Adam, Jamie, Cathryn and Dylan aged between seventeen and nineteen. They are walking home on a dark lonely road on Halloween night after they have been drinking in a graveyard and telling ghost stories. As they walk home, Jamie starts to tell the story about the guy who was killed on the road over ten years ago when he lost control of his motorbike and crashed into a tree and lost his head. When his friends start to laugh, he tells them it's no joke and that they say the ghost of the guy walks then road looking for his head. Not believing him, his friends continue to slag him and joke about the ghost and the lost head. These jokes are turned to fear when the ghost of the guy appears and gives then a good fright.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227870</url></doc>
