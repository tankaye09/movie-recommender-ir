<plot>When Lonnie lashes out at his wife Jennifer (the household breadwinner) one too many times, he is forced out onto the streets of New Jersey. Stripped of all cash and credit cards, he embarks on a journey that takes him from upscale suburban New Jersey to its dark underbelly and finally its pristine forests. With Lonnie beaten down and truly sorry, Jennifer finally allows him to return home -- but only after spending the night in the woods.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119744</url></doc>
