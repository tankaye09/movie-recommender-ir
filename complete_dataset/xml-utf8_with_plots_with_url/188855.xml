<plot>In 1968 Gordon Parks wrote an article for Life magazine on race and poverty in the United States. For his story, Parks photographed the Fontenelle family, a disenfranchised African American family of twelve living in extreme poverty in a small Harlem apartment. The American public's response to the Life photo essay was so great that Parks worked with the magazine to purchase the family a home on Long Island. In Patricia Riggen's moving and insightful documentary, Richard and Diana;the only surviving members of the family;render their own family portrait as they recount the challenges the family faced. Through interviews with Richard Fontenelle, Diana Nash and Gordon Parks, we meet two survivors in a family that has struggled confronting the social obstacles of racism, poverty, addiction, and AIDS, problems that have ravaged Black communities nation-wide.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188855</url></doc>
