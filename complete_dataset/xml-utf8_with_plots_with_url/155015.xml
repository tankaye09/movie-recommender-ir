<plot>Ginger starts this complex web of romantic blunders as she misinterprets Evan's well-intentioned call to be a blow-off of their relationship. She, in turn, moves on to Lance and makes him fall for her, only to pull back and leave him on his own. The domino-effect continues as each character stumbles into another, all struggling to overcome their own fears and insecurity in order to make a true connection with someone else.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?155015</url></doc>
