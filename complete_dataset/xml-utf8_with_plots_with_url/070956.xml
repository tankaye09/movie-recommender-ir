<plot>Archie has made a discovery that will change the world forever. A toy radio. Archie's brother Billy, is deaf. So, Archie duct tapes the radio to his head, to help him explore a world full of sound. Sophie is Archie's girlfriend. Archie thinks he is in love with Sophie, but Sophie is not sure they know what love is. They spend their time waxing each other's noses, deciding if getting slapped is worse than getting spit on, and arguing about anything that's not worth arguing about. Then one day, Archie decides to steal Billy fare and square from their repressive sister. Sophie decides to go along for the ride. The adventure that follows will force them to seriously consider: Do relationships rely on riding couches through automatic car washes? Is a toy radio really the cure to deafness? Is it legal to throw dead animals in dumpsters? Finding the answers to these important questions makes Archie, Sophie and Billy examine their relationships in ways they never thought possible.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070956</url></doc>
