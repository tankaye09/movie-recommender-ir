<plot>'Forgiven' is about a man named James who has an encounter with Jesus Christ during His walk with the cross to the crucifixion site. It turns out that James is the one who nails Jesus to the cross and as he does so, he starts to remember the bad things in his life which are affecting it and the people around him. He begins to realize that his sins are what nailed Jesus to the cross. This encounter gives James forgiveness, hope, and a second chance to live a better life then the one he was living previously.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200772</url></doc>
