<plot>As Pandit Shyam Sunder prayed in Bhagwan Shivji's temple on the occasion of Janamashtami, his wife gives birth to a daughter, Rupa, and passes away, leaving her child to bear the brunt of being an ill-omen. Years later, Rupa burns her face from a frying pot, thus disfiguring the right side of her face completely, so much so that when she matures, the scar being so hideous, that no one in the village nor surrounding area wants to marry her. Then an Engineer named Rajeev arrives from Bombay, he approaches Shyam Sunder to seek his permission and blessings, so that he can marry Rupa. Protesting strongly, Rupa is asked to marry Rajeev and re-locate to his house. When Rajeev finds out that his wife is disfigured, he refuses to have to do anything with her. Then one day when he returns from a trip out of town, he is told that Rupa is expecting his child. Watch what impact this has on Rajiv and what he does to expose Rupa in the community.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?478710</url></doc>
