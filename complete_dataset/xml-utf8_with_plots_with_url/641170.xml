<plot>Jack Williams is an undercover cop who's having a really bad year. His wife has left him and she's taking his kid way, a new drug called "Rapture" has taken over the streets and he's been sent undercover to one of the sleaziest night clubs in town to infiltrate the violent new breed. The Breed are a new race created by vicious demons. They rule the streets like an underground army, and they are taking over. But that's not the worst part... the Anti-Christ has been born in the Breed headquarters under New York City. Jack's daughter, Amy has run away from home and been kidnapped by members of the Breed and taken to their barbaric torture dungeons and Jack's ex-wife, Lillian is enslaved by the lead demon Asmodeus for a midnight plaything! Jack and his partner, Steve must travel through the very gates of hell to rescue Amy, her friend Tamara, and to destroy the young Anti-Christ child before it's too late. They must take the unholy offspring to the last church remaining in New York, where Pastor Williams must perform a baptism ritual before the demons catch them. The problem is that the church is two hours away from the underground headquarters and it's already beginning to get dark!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641170</url></doc>
