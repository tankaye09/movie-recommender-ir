<plot>Set in and around Manhattan, a young alcoholic named Garland Peak wanders around the city followed by the demons that have been haunting him in the form of his 12-year old self and the ghost of his dead mother. Struggling with the emotional turmoil brought on by the suicide of his alcoholic mother and the loss of all he once thought encompassed love, Garland must look back at his life and decide whether or not to allow himself to fall off the edge of reason and follow the same destructive path of his mother or find ultimate redemption. Based on the writer's own true life experiences, Approaching Heaven is a story of overcoming the fears which can haunt even the most fearless of men and women and finding strength in life. It is a story of struggle against all odds that touches upon not only the tragic moments that occur in our lives, but also the humor and hope that can be found if we learn to live one day at a time and stand up to those moments in life that can make even the strongest of men crumble. It is a story of hope and perserverance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043867</url></doc>
