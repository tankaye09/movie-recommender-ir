<plot>After the events of the first game the victorious Ikari Warriors are returning home when they are warped through space and time to help save the indeterminate planet from 'Zang Zip the War Dog'. When we last saw Paul and Vince (Ralf Jones and Clark Steel), they had saved the Colonel and were about to head for home in a special plane given to them by the General. But then, while in flight over the ocean, the sky suddenly blackened, the ocean began to churn and the plane goes spinning! A booming voice fills the cockpit: 'Hear me, Warriors! Zang Zip, the War Dog, has enslaved the people of Earth. Only you can save us from his grip of evil!' Caught in a time warp, hurled thousands of years into the future, Paul and Vince know they have no choice but to meet this impossible challenge head-on. After all, they are professionals, they are the Ikari Warriors!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?257101</url></doc>
