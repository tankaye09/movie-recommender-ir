<plot>A most amusing film is this. A number of darkies are seen on all fours in a cage and they snarl and bite at each other like wild animals. The lion tamer cautiously enters and appears to have considerable trouble in subduing them. He pricks them with a pointed instrument and is assisted in this by two men on the outside who have similar weapons. The (lions) darkies are finally subdued.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087080</url></doc>
