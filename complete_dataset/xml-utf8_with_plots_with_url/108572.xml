<plot>Satyapti lives a middle-classed lifestyle in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi, along with his wife, Kaushalya, three sons: Ram, Bharat, Balram, and a daughter, Tulsi. He used to be a soldier in Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's Azad Hind Fauj, and after India attained independence served in the army, and is now retired, receiving a meager pension. His son, Ram, also served in the army, got wounded, lost his leg, and disfigured the right side of his face, got discharged from the army, and suspects his wife, Rukmani, of prostitution. Bharat, honest to a fault, works as a Clerk with the Ministry of Defence, while Balram and Tulsi are collegians and their father arranges to pay for their education after mortgaging his farmland. Bharat used to love Sneh, but she married wealthy Vijay Kapoor, leaving him embittered. Then things change for the better when Bharat wins a 10 Lakh Rupee lottery. They pay off their mortgage, move into a bigger house, Ram gets plastic surgery and an artificial leg, while Bharat gets ready to get engaged to Pooja, his co-worker. Their idealist world is shattered when Satyapati finds out that Bharat has obtained 10 Lakh Rupees by accepting a bribe to steal a file from Rahim U. Khan; Balram and his girlfriend rob the Express Bank; Ram finds out how Rukmani is earning money;Tulsi gets raped by Dalbeer; while Pooja gets sexually molested by General Jindal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108572</url></doc>
