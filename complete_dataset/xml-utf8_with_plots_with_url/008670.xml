<plot>A prim customer wearing flowing whiskers comes into a barber shop. Two small boys divert the barber's attention, and proceed to give the prim gentleman a novel shaving. They tie him to the chair, cover his face with suds from a whitewash brush and trim his whiskers down to the skin. The barber rushes in only to receive the contents of the pail of suds intended for the mischievous boys.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008670</url></doc>
