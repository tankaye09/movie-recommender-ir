<plot>This Vitaphone featurette features an orchestra comprised of over 100 youngsters from the L.A. area. The orchestra is directed by Peter Meremblum, while eight-year-old Jack Horner---no, he isn't Little Jack Horner---is the featured soloist on Clementi's "Sonatina." The orchestra also plays excerts from Tschaikowsky's "Fifth Symphony" and Wagner's "Die Meistersinger." The finale is "Pop Goes the Weasel", which probably should have been the first number in order to keep the audience from heading for the consession booth. The short was reissued on May 29, 1954.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090863</url></doc>
