<plot>A successful chef lives his life as he runs his kitchen, but his familiar regime of order and control is put to the test when unexpectedly he falls in love with one of his staff. Today he decides to make his feelings known, and so he writes.

As reality and plan diverge, the chef begins to lose his grip.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548283</url></doc>
