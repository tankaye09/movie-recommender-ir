<plot>Marianna, a wealthy and immoral girl, is involved with Marios, who is the leader of a gang of burglars which has robbed a jewelry store in Athens. The robbery was staged at midday by Alekos, his girlfriend, Souzy and Sotos. Mairi, who is a maid in Marianna's house, is also a member of the gang, which is now planning a more ambitious score, since they know the particular weakness that Marianna's father has for Kaiti, Marianna's quiet and modest sister, who wants to become a painter. She is drugged and photographed naked in the arms of Alekos. Later, they demand a large sum of money, otherwise they will send the pictures to her father, who has a heart condition. The money is given to them, and Marios tries to grab both money and jewels. Mairi catches him in the act, however, and kills him, while the others try to escape abroad. Meanwhile, Mairi, confused, parks in a no-parking zone, and, consequently, the traffic police tow the car away - containing all the stolen goods.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049990</url></doc>
