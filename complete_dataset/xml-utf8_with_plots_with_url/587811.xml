<plot>The Rose Marine Theater in Texas has recently been recognized by the US government as a national historical landmark. It failed at showing American films in the 1920's and began presenting Spanish language films to the North Side's growing Hispanic population and embraced a culture that was in the middle many famous acts such as Pedro Infante, Dolores Del Rio and many other acts preformed or presented Films to the community that was neither considered Mexican or American. The film explains the hardships of living as a minority and finding a place that could be called their own. In this slow conversion to Americanism the new generation still uses the theater to express a sense of place in the community and in this country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?587811</url></doc>
