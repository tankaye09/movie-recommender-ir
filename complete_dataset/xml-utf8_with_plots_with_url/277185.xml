<plot>The newest generation in a long line of virile construction workers, Jimmy's career has been planned since he can remember. Moreover, his father has suppressed his insatiable appetite for creativity - or more specifically his dream to become a world-class balloon entertainer. Strolling through his daily morning tasks, a lethargic Jimmy arrives late to a work, only to be publicly humiliated by his vertically challenged and shortly tempered boss. As Jimmy suffers through this tantrum, he is reminiscent of his childhood and similar speeches delivered by his father. Nevertheless, it's this interaction that leads to an opportunity for Jimmy to showcase his ballooning talents to a young entitled girl...it's the first in a series of trials and tribulations where Jimmy must choose to live life like his father wanted or branch out and let his imagination run wild.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277185</url></doc>
