<plot>Yiorgos is a serial rapist. His mother thinks that he is gay and tried to force him to get married. It all started from his childhood, when she caught him masturbating while reading a porn magazine and beat him up! He can only have sex when it is combined with violence! Otherwise he cannot have an erection! So he goes out at nights and rapes girls at a nearby park. In the meanwhile he meets a young girl and falls in love with her. He confesses his problem to her and she helps him to be "cured". Soon he leaves her pregnant and they are planning their marriage. During their trip to Thesaloniki, Yiorgos is busted when one of his female victims recognizes him!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269479</url></doc>
