<plot>Casey and her college friends get together to finish some homework when she spots her desired male neighbor and COED classmate. The subject suddenly switches to what she would do with him if they were ever to fall in love. They daydream different versions for most of the day only to realize that it has gotten late and there won't be enough time to study. While Casey's friends try to figure ways to make the best of the day, her dream-boy neighbor takes matters into his own hands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095857</url></doc>
