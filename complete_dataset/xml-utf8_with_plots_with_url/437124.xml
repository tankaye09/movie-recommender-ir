<plot>Point Last Seen is a suspense drama inspired by actual events, in which Rachel Harrison, (played by Linda Hamilton) the head of a search-and-rescue team, works desperately to save the life of a lost child. At the same time she is struggling with the absence of her own children who have been kidnapped by her ex-husband. The only information Rachel has about the lost 9-year-old girl, is that she is wearing a size 3-1/2 tennis shoe with straight lines on the soles and a wad of gum stuck to the bottom. She tracks the girl's footprints through the hot desert sun, and becomes exhausted and dehydrated but keeps searching, determined to find the child before it is too late. Well into the search, Rachel learns that her ex-husband has been found, but her kids are not with him. She continues to look for Mandy while worrying whether or not her own children are alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?437124</url></doc>
