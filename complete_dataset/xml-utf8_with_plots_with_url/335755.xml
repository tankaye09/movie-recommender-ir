<plot>Oliver a young man who is self centered, can't seem to hold on to a girl. He's cheap, chauvinistic, prejudice and closed off to new ideas but he wants love just like everybody else. We watch him as he fails because of the way he thinks and behaves. He finally meets his other half who is just as clueless but unlike Oliver, is open and positive to the world around her. They are both idiots but different kinds of idiots. His outrageous beliefs haunt him in the end and he tries to make sense of it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335755</url></doc>
