<plot>Korea is being polluted by careless companies and by-standers and ends up giving birth to three mutant bird-reptilian like monsters that are out for revenge for their lair being polluted and desolated, so they take it out on humanity. Hippies then gather on Cheju Island to have a party and to enjoy nature while they can, but the monsters try to eventually ruin their fun. Then, a scientist, his daughter, and a maid who practices witchcraft decide to come up with a solution. They make a Jet-Jaguar like robot to fight and tame the monsters, so they won't terrorize humanity anymore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239993</url></doc>
