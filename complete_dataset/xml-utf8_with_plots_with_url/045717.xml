<plot>At the Armour &amp; Co. Chicago yard. Two railroad tracks dominate the center and right half of the frame as we look down about 40 meters where an overpass crosses. Along the left beside the tracks is a nondescript industrial building. Men are standing between the building and the tracks as an engine slowly approaches the foreground. A man crosses just in front of it. It moves slowly past, the engine pulling 15 or 20 small cars. The first set of cars behind the small engine are flatcars, loaded with goods, three workmen riding with them. The back set are small boxcars, each riding on one set of wheels. The trolley passes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045717</url></doc>
