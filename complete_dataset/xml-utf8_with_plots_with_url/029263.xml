<plot>Haley recounts the transformation of a college drop-out into one of America's most powerful nonfiction writers. One of the few in-depth conversations with Haley before his death in 1992, this tape is a moving testament to a man who, like "Roots" itself, became a symbol of African Americans' determination to endure and excel.
