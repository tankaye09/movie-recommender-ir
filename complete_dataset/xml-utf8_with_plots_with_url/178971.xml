<plot>Ennis William Cosby was dyslexic. As a boy, he struggled to learn in school. And he didn't know why. Eventually, Ennis came to understand that he simply learned differently and that he could succeed in school. In this film you'll meet actors, scientists, business leaders, a polar explorer, and dozens of others, both children and adults, who have one thing in common: they all have learning differences. These individuals refused to be limited by their difficulties or defined by the labels that were assigned to them. They, like Ennis William Cosby, found their gifts in their differences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178971</url></doc>
