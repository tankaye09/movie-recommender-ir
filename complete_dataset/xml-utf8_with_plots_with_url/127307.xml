<plot>Sarah Miller is the only survivor in a car accident that wipes out her whole family. Her only way of coping with the tragic loss is to resort to illusion: pills, alcohol, family videos and complete isolation from the outside world. But some things just won't be forgotten, and the fragile dream world she has created crumbles when her husband and son start communicating with her through the videos, and the house which she thought of as her sanctuary becomes a menacing entity. Faced with few options and even fewer choices, Sarah has to decide whether she's going to keep running away from the past or confront it. With her sanity hanging by a thread and the threats against her becoming more and more real, Sarah's quest for the truth will take her to the deepest and most dangerous place of all: her memories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127307</url></doc>
