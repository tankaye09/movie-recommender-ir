<plot>Your friends talk about it, your parents think you are too young for it, and you feel like you are more likely to have a stroke before it happens to you. Sex education teaches the road map of female anatomy, but not the vegetation. A first-time sexual encounter is burdened with anxious pressures of expectation and the unknown. She: slightly more experienced. The sweat building on his palms are the least of his worries. Young and alone, they are in her back shed. For Thomas, this moment is like a band-aid that won't hurt as much if pulled off quickly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655752</url></doc>
