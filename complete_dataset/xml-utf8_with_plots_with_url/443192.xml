<plot>Joel and Paul convince Lisa and Anna to embark on a spontaneous journey to enjoy the weekend and get away from daily life. They're plans are temporarily shattered as their car breaks down, but little do they know that their night is about to get a lot worse. They decide to make the best of their situation by resting out the night at a nearby Motel. Halfway through the night the guys are shaken out of their deep sleep by a rumbling noise in the courtyard. A shocking discovery follows- the girls are gone and the hotel manager is dead. Knowing that their survival chance is very slim they decide to go and look for the girls and thereby unwillingly fall prey to the killers sadistic intent of utter destruction. As the night wears on, Joel and Paul must do anything they can to find the girls and last until daylight. Will they succeed or will they not emerge from the long and unforgiving night?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?443192</url></doc>
