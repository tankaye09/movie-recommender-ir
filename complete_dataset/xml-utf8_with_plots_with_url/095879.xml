<plot>Marko and Atanas are two friends whose lives would be sweet as strudel but for an annoying little problem with their papers. They need a European passport and they are prepared to do almost anything to get one, including buying a wife. With nothing but their brass necks and 7,000 euros, they set out to find the woman of their dreams - one who will walk them down aisle and then hang around long enough for the divorce. An odyssey through Vienna's immigrant netherworld, this real-life Green Card is an hilarious and touching insight into what it takes to jump the barriers of Fortress Europe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095879</url></doc>
