<plot>The Toughest Girl in the World is a coming of age drama set in a small seaside town. Carol and Jess hang out together. Jess is easily led by Carol but both girls relish bullying Rat and his mates at the local Arcade or on the beach front. Their friendship is brought into question when Elodie a beautiful French exchange student arrives to stay with Jess and Carol takes an immediate dislike to her. As Carol starts to feel excluded from the new friendship a tension develops between her and Jess. This heightens when Carol discovers from Elodie that Jess has not told her about a beach party. Carol goes to the party and ignoring Jess starts to warm to Elodie. The French girl notices Carol has her eyes on a sexy lad, so she convinces Carol to play a game with her. Intrigued by the strange suggestion Carol goes along with Elodie. The next day Carol realizes everyone knows what happened at the party. Humiliated she confronts Elodie to discover that her best friend Jess has let her down. With her vulnerability exposed she is forced to look at the situation. Finding an inner strength, she does something completely out of character, shocking her friends and proving to herself that she is capable of being entirely her own person.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596445</url></doc>
