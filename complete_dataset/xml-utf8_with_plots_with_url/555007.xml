<plot>An admiring, uncritical biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, released three years after her death. The film focuses solely on her, beginning with her unhappy childhood after both her parents had died by the time she was 10. In 1905, she married her fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was elected President in 1932. She always was concerned for the oppressed, and was a great supporter of civil rights, even if it was unfashionable. As First Lady, she traveled ceaselessly visiting the troops in the Second World War. After the war she became a US representative to the United Nations, and chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights, where she was a key contributor to the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555007</url></doc>
