<plot>In a candlelit room at 1:30 a.m., a dominatrix finishes with a client and relaxes with her wig, gloves, collar, and chains off. A knock at the door surprises her, and in comes an old client (and maybe ex-boyfriend) who urgently tells her she must leave. She follows him down the fire escape to her car, and he has her drive him to a warehouse. He confesses it's a game and no one is following him, but he'll pay her $10,000 to tie him up and beat him. Will she get ideas of her own, once he's securely fastened? If it's a confidence game, which one has the most confidence?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113887</url></doc>
