<plot>Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent by the federal government on abstinence-from-sex-until-marriage education across America. This compelling documentary is a case study of abstinence education coming into one public school system in Albuquerque, N.M. and the firestorm of controversy that ensued. The debate is typical of what is happening in other communities around the country. This documentary gives voice to a diverse spectrum of people; teens, parents, public health officials, and educators, right up the line to state officials and national advocates on both sides of this important issue. Abstinence Comes to Albuquerque objectively examines the landscape of a debate that is emblematic of a divided America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021794</url></doc>
