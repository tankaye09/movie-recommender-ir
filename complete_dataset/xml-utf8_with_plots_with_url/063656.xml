<plot>An insightful documentary about Thai cinema, which features a colourful and long running film history, yet struggles as the industry attempts to move forward. This film examines the past and focuses on the Thai New Wave since 1997 by combining film clips, and interviews from Thai directors and others artists, like Asian hip-hop sensation Thaitanium, who are trying to create a more personal style of art. It is a portrait of the industry that includes illuminating conversations with internationally acclaimed filmmakers such as Pen-ek Ratanaruang, Wisit Sasanatieng, and Apichatpong Weerasethakul. The film blends thoughtful interviews of other artists and players in the Thai film industry with clips of great films like Country Hotel, Last Life in the Universe, Tropical Malady, and Tears of the Black Tiger. Both the country and the film industry have their hands tied with a myriad of issues and this film investigates these problems and then looks forward to the future through the eyes of some of the most important players in the Thai cinema.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063656</url></doc>
