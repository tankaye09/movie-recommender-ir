<plot>Examines the deterioration of a lifelong friendship between two drifting twenty-somethings. The friends reunite months later to go on a chest-pounding masculinity retreat that teaches men to get in touch with their primal instincts, and how to hunt. Unfortunately, the guys never find their group in the woods, and when hunting season begins it appears that Babe and Hank have become the targets. Playing out back and forth in time between the dissolution of their friendship in the city, and their adventure in the woods, the events of the past and present dovetail, leading to one horrible but inevitable conclusion as two boys struggle to understand what it means to be a man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355630</url></doc>
