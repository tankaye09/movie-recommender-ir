<plot>When a young husband goes off to a college reunion party, his wife leaves one of her gloves in his coat pocket to remind him to come home early. When he finally does return home--late, as always--he pulls out the glove in front of his wife and, not knowing that it was hers to begin with, starts making up a story about how it got there.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?593592</url></doc>
