<plot>On June 27, 1978, a 44-car freight train struck and killed two Crow Indian brothers near the quaint town of Little Falls, NY. The day before, Bobby, 13, and Tyler, 11, had disappeared. They had run away from the white, Baptist family that seven years earlier had adopted them out of a troubled home on the Crow reservation in Montana. Their new home, a vast 19th century Victorian castle, seemed idyllic. But the boys had discovered a dark secret. They were killed as they tried to return to the reservation to get help. In the documentary LOST SPARROW, filmmaker Chris Billing has embarked on a quest to find out what happened to his adoptive brothers, and to confront a painful family history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343662</url></doc>
