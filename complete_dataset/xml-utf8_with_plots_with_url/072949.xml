<plot>Jack and Beatrice Willard have plans to go to the theater, but when Jack's law partner gets tickets to a prize fight, Jack lies to his wife and cancels the theater trip. Beatrice then decides to play bridge with some friends, and when they both come home very late, they have a bitter argument. The next morning, they make up, and swear never again to sneak out on each other. But then, on their wedding anniversary, a similar situation arises, and this time both of them will find it much harder to explain themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072949</url></doc>
