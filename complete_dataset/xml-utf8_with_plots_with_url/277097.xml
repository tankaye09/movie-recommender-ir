<plot>In the dead of the night, a young woman's dead body is recovered by the police. All leads point to Jimmy. A mechanical engineer by day and a dancing sensation by night, Jimmy works as a DJ in the local discotheque to pay off the debts left behind by his late father. While everybody is shocked, Jimmy owns up to the murder and is sentenced to death. Why would a young man on the threshold of life commit such a heinous crime? Only Jimmy knows the truth. In a sudden twist of fate, Jimmy realizes in jail that he has been drawn in to a vicious conspiracy. But it is too late... or is it? What follows is a spine-chilling suspense drama that unfolds in this fast-paced saga of crime, deceit and murder.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277097</url></doc>
