<plot>The year 1945 sees the world at war and commuter Robert Davis is entrenched in his own battles at home. Stilted by the endless berating from a curmudgeon boss and slighted by his uncharitable wife, Robert's life is ruled by the whimsy of others. His daily commute home remains uneventful until his train is delayed and his briefcase, full of important documents concerning the merger of his contracting firm, comes up missing. On a desperate search against an encroaching deadline, Robert scours the railroad station for the briefcase, only to encounter a devastation that could have been caused by the newly developed atom bomb. Is this just end of the line for Robert or the end of the world?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581533</url></doc>
