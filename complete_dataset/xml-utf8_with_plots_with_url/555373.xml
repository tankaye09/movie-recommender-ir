<plot>In an otherwise deserted meadow, a man has set up a table with two chairs, glasses and a bottle of wine. A woman arrives on a bicycle. They sit across from each other, he pours the wine, and she breaks off their affair. After several minutes of exchanging every clich√© in the book, they agree to have one last drink and play the game one more time. Who they are and the game they play is slowly revealed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555373</url></doc>
