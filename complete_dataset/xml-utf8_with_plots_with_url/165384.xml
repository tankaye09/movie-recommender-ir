<plot>Eddie Izzard, the transvestite king of comedy, comes roaring back with all of his wry wit and absurd observations in one of his biggest shows ever. Performed in front of a sell-out crowd of over 44,000 over 4 nights at Wembley Stadium in London, Eddie never lets up the funny as he deals with the important issues ranging from Medusa's hair care, fighting sharks, dentistry, and the universal hatred of houseflies. Eddie's unique delivery keeps the audience in stitches even during his pauses, demonstrating again why he is one of the top comedians in the world. EDDIE IZZARD: LIVE FROM WEMBLEY features the master of comedy at the top of his game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165384</url></doc>
