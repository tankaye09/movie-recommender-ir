<plot>A most novel picture is this. One wonders how it was taken, as the machines are so rapid that before one could take a snapshot they are gone. One after the other they speed past like the wind, and it is safe to predict that were anything to break the occupants would be dashed to pieces before the machine could be brought to a halt. Lots of action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541277</url></doc>
