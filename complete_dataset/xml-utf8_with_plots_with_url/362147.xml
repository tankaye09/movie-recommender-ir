<plot>A Middle-Eastern woman, named Maya, is kept locked in her room by her brother at all hours of the day. One day, an American soldier sneaks into her room after surviving a helicopter crash from a bomb attack below. He request's Maya not to give him away and promises he will leave at night. Frightened, Maya obeys. Once the soldier engages Maya in conversation, he gets to know her, and discovers that she is living a life of abuse under her brother, Ali. The soldier tries his best to convince Maya to escape with him that very night. Maya thinks about it, and hesitantly agrees to run away with him after gaining his trust and feeling an attraction to him. At Maya's attempt at escape, Ali stops her. Maya's reality slowly begins to unravel when she starts questioning her actions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362147</url></doc>
