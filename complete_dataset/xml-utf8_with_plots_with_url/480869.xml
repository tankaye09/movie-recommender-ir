<plot>Something's happening deep in the heartland of America. Some folks are calling Fairfield, Iowa - the "Midwestern Stepford." And the County Commissioners say, "We really don't know what's going on here!" But a legendary Hollywood director and the local school he's teamed up with know exactly what's up in Fairfield. School of Thought is a mysterious and amazing adventure into the Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment with Academy Award-nominee, David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and The Elephant Man). David brings along a few friends to Fairfield, including Beatles collaborator, Donovan (Mellow Yellow, Hurdy Gurdy Man and Sunshine Superman) and the world-renowned quantum physicist, John Hagelin (What The Bleep Do We Know!?)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?480869</url></doc>
