<plot>Neil Fontaine, an insomniac Marine, is discharged from service and returns home to his home in small-town Iowa. An only child, Neil is surprised by how much his younger cousins have grown in his absence. As Neil's insomnia persists, the already-strained relationship between his father Grant and his aunt Regina becomes even more sour. As Neil tries to adjust to being back home, he starts to become privy to the source of the bad blood between Grant and Regina: the suicide of their brother over thirty years prior. Confronting his father for being lost in the past, Neil realizes that he must contend with his own trauma, and at least attempt to move on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320930</url></doc>
