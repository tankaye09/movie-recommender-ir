<plot>Chip Douglas is a washed-out alcoholic car salesman at a used car lot. With the endless availability of information over the Internet, customers can now get any information about any car they want. They can find out if it's ever been in a wreck, theft recovery or water damage by means of "CARFAX." In addition, they can also find out a vehicle's true value by factory invoice or "KELLY BLUE BOOK," making it almost impossible to make any profit. Now, those still in the business are either trying to come up with scams to make money at it, or get out of it entirely. While Chip is at an off-track racing bar, he happens across a drink called a Molotov Cocktail. That's when he gets the great idea of burning a bunch of cars forcing people to replace them. Chip then solicits his co-worker buddy John Harris to carry out his desperate plan. Everything works out great, or so they believe. Since all the cars that were destroyed were from their previous customers, they obviously become the prime suspects for the crime. During this time, the other salespeople are coming up with their own ways to get out of the business. Ramone Cordova is a Mexican immigrant that moved to this country so doctors could do studies on his right-hand index finger. For some unknown reason this finger continued to grow after he was fully developed and, by this point, the digit grown to nine inches long. Since he wasn't making much of a living at selling cars, he decided to keep selling them until he could become a porno star. Ramone writes his own porno screenplay (a Sci-Fi pun) that only he could star in, contributing slapstick elements to the story. The "in-your-face" humor is brought by the antagonist, Justin Rhoads, who is a chemically-imbalanced schizophrenic and delusional. Throughout the film, he daydreams about killing his customers and co-workers. He, in a hilarious way, will offend just about every type of person he encounters, delighting the audience when he is framed for arson and insurance fraud.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186371</url></doc>
