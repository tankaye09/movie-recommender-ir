<plot>A TV remake of Elaine Sterne Carrington's radio serial When A Girl Marries, Follow Your Heart was the story of wealthy Julie Fielding who went against her mother and fell in love with Harry Davis, a man from lower means working for her father. Despite the long separation from her own husband, Mrs. Fielding lived a charade of contentment and expected Julie to do so with the appropriately wealthy fianc√© she chose for her daughter. The plot went askew when the action veered from Julie's love affair with Harry Davis to his ambivalence with nefarious gangster Nicki Destini, out to sabotage Harry's work with Julie's father Sam. Julie and Harry were scheduled to wed after a twenty-six week cycle but NBC canceled on the twenty-fifth, cheating viewers of the lovers reunion. TV Guide published a letter of protest from a disheartened viewer to no avail on NBC.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198977</url></doc>
