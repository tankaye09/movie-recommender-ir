<plot>In the first chapter, a spaceship from the planet Tacatón arrives to a small Spanish town. There, it breaks, leaving its occupants, Yupi and Astrako, stuck in the Earth. They contact the people in the town and become their friends. Following the system that "Barrio Sesamo" had, each episode is mixed with puppets sketches that were basically educational. In the second season, another spaceship arrives to the town, and Yupi, Astrako and some of their friends enter in it. The spaceship, managed by a robot, takes off and they get away from the Earth. It eventually goes broken and they land on another planet, where they live many adventures. In 1991, Yupi was the host of a program of short chapter were he told us fairy tales. Since then, he's never come back to TV although this character was very popular in Spain at that time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?342802</url></doc>
