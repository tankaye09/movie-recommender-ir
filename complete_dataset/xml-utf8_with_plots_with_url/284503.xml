<plot>Probably one of the finest pictures yet secured of Kaiser Wilhelm. It was taken during the ceremonies of the launching of a German battleship. Kaiser Wilhelm with a large number of notables is seen walking up the wharf, accompanied by Admiral Von Tripets, Prince Henry, of Prussia, and others. The Kaiser shows up to good advantage, the picture being life size and very prominent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284503</url></doc>
