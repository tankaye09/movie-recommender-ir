<plot>T.K. Kenny and Mickey Gubiacci are a highway patrolman and a trucker respectively. Now the two of them don't get along and have nothing in common except for the fact that they are both married to the daughters of Winston Goodhue, and that they don't like him. When Kenny divorces his wife, Goodhue makes it difficult for him to see his son, Win, and would like to keep him away from Win. Goodhue eventually gets Kenny thrown out of the department. Mickey, who has been hauling some illegal loads for Goodhue is arrested and Goodhue convinces his daughter to dump him. And Goodhue takes away his truck. Eventually, Kenny and Mickey get together and decide to get back at Goodhue. And the best way they decide to do that is to throw a monkey wrench into his new development project.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084500</url></doc>
