<plot>This is a story of Maria, a young Filipino woman who is ashamed of her family and her culture and has estranged herself from them in an effort to be normal. After being told that a nose job would give her a better chance at a modeling career, Maria is forced to move back home with her family in order to save money for the procedure. Back at home, Maria avoids any activity that would result in reconnecting with her family and her culture; however she eventually develops relationships with her nieces who, unlike Maria, have embraced their Filipino culture. It is through the eyes of these youngsters that she is able to gain the strength to see the beauty in her unique upbringing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243817</url></doc>
