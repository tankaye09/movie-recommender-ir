<plot>Headspace is a film about personal freedom and liberation. Throughout it's surreal and dreaming scenery it tries to portray the resistance of the individual against all those factors that are trying to eliminate his freedom and free will. A film full with symbols, such as the metronomes, which represent the fast speeds of the modern society, akin to the it's mechanical sounds, it tries to sync you in its rhythm and speed. The whole piece is represented as a 'Visual Choreography'. It has been constructed around the principles of dance and precisely ballet. Here ballet is not just a form of dance, it's the two contradictory sides of ones soul and mind. The driving force that keeps the film alive, is laying into the concept of the 'Art of Vision: An Art of the Eye'. There is no reality and there is no fantasy, all that it is, is all you can see. What we call reality is not more than just a junction of subjective perception and restrained thoughts. Headspace is just... A STATE OF MIND.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233011</url></doc>
