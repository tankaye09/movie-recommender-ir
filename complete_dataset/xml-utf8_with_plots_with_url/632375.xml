<plot>The true story of Italian auto-racing legend Tazio Nuvolari as he struggles and triumphs during the 1930s golden age of car racing. As Enzo Ferrari's driver, Nuvolari sets out and wins one of the most spectacular competitions in racing history but along the way must contend with fierce driver rivalry, competing car makers, family conflicts, and the agenda of Germany and Italy's fascist regimes to use racers as propaganda to promote their political aims. Nuvolari's victory at the 1935 German Grand Prix still stands as the greatest victory of Man over Machine that the world has ever witnessed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632375</url></doc>
