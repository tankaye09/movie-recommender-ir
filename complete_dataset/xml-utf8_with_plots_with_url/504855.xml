<plot>SOLACE: Wisdom of the Dying grew from Camille's intimate experiences with people facing the end of their lives. As a hospice nurse, she has worked closely with patients, families, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and many health care professionals to address the needs of dying people as well as the needs of the health care community in being able to integrate the end of ones life as a natural and sacred human process rather than as a medical failure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?504855</url></doc>
