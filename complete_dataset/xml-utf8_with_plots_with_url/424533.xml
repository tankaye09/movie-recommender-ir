<plot>Middle-aged Bill Thompson returns to his ranch with his much younger bride, Janice, and her supposed brother Lon. When Thompson's son Dan disapproves of the surprise re-marriage of his father, the latter orders him off the ranch, without his promised horses, despite the pleas of ranch foreman Jimmy Wakely and cowhand "Cannonball". Janice and Lon, in reality sweethearts, plot to gain Thompson's rich holdings. In town, outlaws Kirk and Hashknife try to persuade the intoxicated Dan to let them steal the horses. Thompson breaks with his son again when he sees him drinking. Jimmy and "Cannonball" thwart the horse rustlers and Janice swears secrecy when the trusting-Jimmy tells her that Dan led the horse thieves, but she has Lon inform her husband. Thompson hits Dan, tells him to leave and sends for his attorney to draw up the papers to disinherit his son. Lon kills Thompson, and Dan is jailed on circumstantial evidence. Jimmy and "Cannonball" help him escape jail, but he is wounded and brought to the ranch to have Janice dress his wound. The trusting-Jimmy departs, while Lon awaits in the next room to get rid of the last obstacle in his and Janice's scheme.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424533</url></doc>
