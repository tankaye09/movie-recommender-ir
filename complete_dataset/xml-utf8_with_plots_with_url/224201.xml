<plot>In the cut and thrust world of filmmaking there are few names that stand out quite so far and so proud as Shirley Major and John Spate. This pair of London based filmmakers have been working together for the better part of a decade to produce some of the world's finest unseen classics. The world they move in is one of shadows and intrigue where violence and the even present danger of being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time hang over head. This is not the usual setting for a film auteur to make his name but for Shirley and John it has become the routine, the only way in which they can manage to produce works which have gone on to inspire some of the most successful filmmakers of our current generation. This documentary seeks to understand why the larger world has been ignoring Shirley and John for so long. In order to do this we followed them as they sought to bring about a new revolution in the way that the film industry works, using every resources they have they plan to introduce Guerrilla Distribution to the world. At the same time it will try to uncover the truth behind the rumour that one man in New Zealand has dedicated his life to ensuring that these two filmmakers will never amount to anything, whilst simultaneously using their ideas and work to make himself one of the most powerful and feared figures within the entertainment industry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224201</url></doc>
