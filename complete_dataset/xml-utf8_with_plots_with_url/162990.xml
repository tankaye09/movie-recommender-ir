<plot>Dynamite Headdy is a character who's main attack comes from his disembodied head. Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds - for example heads that could heal you or heads that would stick into walls. You had to use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you could grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages it was used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gained a propeller, jet or bird head. Just a traditional platformer with a twist.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162990</url></doc>
