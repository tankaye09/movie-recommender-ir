<plot>Mustafa is a successful business man living a seemingly great life with his family when an accident takes it all away from him and leaves him with many questions and a cab driver, Fikret, who can answer it all. Mustafa is due to get a lot more than what he bargained for, however, as his interrogations take him to long-forgotten childhood memories and force him to see his formerly perfect life from a very different perspective. Why does it feel like everybody is lying to him? Mustafa will soon find out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382687</url></doc>
