<plot>'Yellow Face' is one Chinese Actress' journey to discover what it means to be 'Asian' in America. The filmmaker is the first Chinese National to be accepted into the Juilliard School's Drama Division. Since her graduation in 2008 she has followed the protest against 'Yellow Face' in Hollywood. 'Avatar: The Last Airbender,' a children's show on Nickelodeon featured Asian and Inuit characters in a fantasy setting. The creators of the show were inspired and informed by Asian and Inuit culture. The upcoming live action feature 'The Last Airbender' produced by Paramount cast all three leads white, and filled background roles and non-speaking extras with Asian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern nationalities. Although the 'Yellow Face' casting outraged many fans, others remain at peace with it. The filmmaker raises these questions: Is Whitewashing Racist? Why does 'Yellow Face' still exist in 2009? And this idea of what's 'Asian' in America today, is it racist? And what is the societal impact on future generations?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664688</url></doc>
