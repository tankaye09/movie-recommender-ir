<plot>President Bush's call for an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enshrine a heterosexual definition of marriage ignited a wave of civil disobedience same-sex marriages across the USA. "One Summer in New Paltz" focuses on the small village of New Paltz, NY, where the mayor, Jason West, began performing same-sex marriages on the steps of village hall and 1000s of couples flooded the village seeking to be married. The film goes on to document civil disobedience same-sex marriages and demonstrations across New York State, the Nyack Ten legal suit against New York state and the first day of legal same-sex marriages in Boston Massachusetts in May 2004. "One Summer in New Paltz", probes into the debate on same-sex marriage examining the intersection of same-sex marriage, war, the Constitution, race and the family. A strong work about grass roots organizing, straight/gay alliances and confrontation with state repression.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412674</url></doc>
