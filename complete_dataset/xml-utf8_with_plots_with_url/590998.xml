<plot>Bart Simpson has been sent to his room and it's up to you to help him escape and collect the items he'll need to rescue his hero Krusty the Clown. Along with the standard side scroller jump/duck, Bart is armed with a variety of weapons such as a slingshot, spray paint, and water balloons which he can use to dispatch the space mutants, basement ghosts, and other uncool things getting in his way. There are six levels for exploration including a spider infested attic, the Springfield Mall, and a twisted Itchy &amp; Scratchy dream world. Ultimately, when Bart manages to complete all the levels, he is taken to Krustyland for a final showdown with his nemesis Sideshow Bob.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?590998</url></doc>
