<plot>Chuck is a killer who picks up innocent hitchhikers and murders them, leaving their bodies on the side of the highway like road kill. Rayne is a hitchhiking serial killer, who slaughters those that pick her up. When these two meet up, sparks fly, worlds collide...people die. Their initial encounter leaves Chuck with a serious limp and Rayne nearly unconscious. She is almost run over by Rebecca, a young girl on a cross-country trek to get back home. Believing Rayne to have been in an accident, Rebecca offers to help. Rayne accepts the ride, but refuses the help before passing out in Rebecca's car. Meanwhile, infuriated that she's stealing his thunder, Chuck begins pursuing Rayne, unaware that Rebecca has taken her in. At first too weak to act out her homicidal tendencies, Rayne becomes Rebecca's fellow traveler, and learns the reasons for her journey. Rayne finds herself torn between wanting to add Rebecca to her death list and becoming her mentor. Hot on her trail, Chuck unleashes a path of destruction, killing anyone who gets in his way and one ill-fated victim who had the unfortunate luck of resembling Rayne. Frustrated by her feelings for Rebecca, Rayne takes it out on a few hapless victims of her own, all the while keeping her true nature a secret from her road partner. When Rebecca offers to take Rayne home and begin a new life together, Rayne finds herself tempted. They say dead men tell no tales, but unfortunately one of Rayne's victims does. A news report about a recent murder shows a picture of the deceased, and Rebecca recognizes the man as someone who had antagonized them earlier. Faced with the truth and unable to handle it, Rebecca leaves but is kidnapped by Chuck, who has finally caught up to them. Chuck calls Rayne and using Rebecca as bait, challenges her to a showdown to determine just whom the road belongs to. The battle that ensues is one for the ages, a blood fest that will leave all three of them changed forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?464914</url></doc>
