<plot>This is a splendid film showing the complete demolition of a giant chimney, the foundation of which had been removed and substituted by beams. These beams were covered with inflammable material and the whole saturated with paraffin. The pile is then lighted and the beams burn away. When they have been sufficiently weakened by the fire the immense chimney totters and then falls with a crash. The chimney is first shown at close view and then as it is about to fall, at a greater distance, showing the full size of the chimney in the field of the camera. A great crowd of people watch the operations with interest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037557</url></doc>
