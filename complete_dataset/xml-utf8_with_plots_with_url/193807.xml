<plot>The Russians and Japanese, while scouting, meet on a bridge in the shade of a beautiful grove. The bridge spans a small body of water, at the end of which is seen a dwelling, where lives a peasant and his family. The combatants engage in a fierce fight for the right of way, and in plain view, some are seen to be raised bodily and thrown into the water, while others, who have been shot and killed, are pushed off by the soldiers of the Czar with their bayonets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193807</url></doc>
