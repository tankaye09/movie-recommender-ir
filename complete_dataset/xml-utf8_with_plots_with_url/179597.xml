<plot>Lino, a reporter, interviews Arlindo, who is a gay and deaf man. In the interview, he tells (always using the sign language) about the community of gay deaf people living in São Paulo, and recounts some stories about himself and his friends with the same problem: Diego, who ends up mixing himself up with drugs, as a result of the social rejection he experiences; Thales, a lonely man who only came out of the closet after meeting some other deaf gay friends; Marcello, who hates condoms and thinks he's immune to Aids and VD; and Erick, with serious relationship problems with his family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?179597</url></doc>
