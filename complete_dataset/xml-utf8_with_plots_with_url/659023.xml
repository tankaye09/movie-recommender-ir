<plot>Mark Bingham was a protective son, loyal friend, successful businessman, championship rugby player, and the life of the party wherever he went. On United Flight 93, Mark helped lead a revolt of the brave passengers against armed hijackers, preventing the plane from reaching its target and saving countless lives. Made by an Emmy Award-winning production team, "With You: The Mark Bingham Story" integrates interviews with Mark's friends, family, journalists, and national leaders with news footage and never-before-seen home movies of his childhood and adulthood. "With You: The Mark Bingham Story" relates the life of an ordinary person who played an extraordinary role on 9/11 and explores themes of individual responsibility, stereotypes, and the true nature of heroism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659023</url></doc>
