<plot>After less than a year of dating, Ben finally gets the courage to tell Samantha he loves her. The sudden announcement comes due to the fact that Samantha is soon to leave for a 2 week modeling gig in LA and Ben is worried she may never return; leaving him stranded and abandoned for the Hollywood lifestyle, much like his old girlfriend Elizabeth did to him years ago. After confining Samantha to a chair, an argument between her and Ben ensues and their true feelings come out concerning their relationship. After it is evident that no matter what, Samantha plans to take her LA trip, Ben takes drastic measures to ensure that she does not leave.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475179</url></doc>
