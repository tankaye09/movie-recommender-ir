<plot>In Per Kirkeby's set with a blue backdrop beside a woodland lake Lene Adler Petersen pronounces Ophelia's madness monologue from Hamlet, but she is constantly interrupted by the sound of two wooden blocks and has to start again: "There's rosemary, that's for remembrance ..." The words thereby rapidly lose their meaning and our interest turns to the specific sounds emerging from Adler Petersen's lips and the choreographed ways she touches her face. The film starts and ends classically with a zoom in from an establishing shot and a zoom out onto a concluding tableau in which Ophelia throws herself into the lake, but in between the film is experimental, with two cameras on tracks abiding by a carefully conceived but highly impenetrable system. The frame thus changes apparently according to signals from Leth, and occasionally the camera seems to track right off the set into the sylvan wilderness. At its premiere at the Carlton it was shown before Roman Polanski's Dance of the vampires.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407586</url></doc>
