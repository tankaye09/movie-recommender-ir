<plot>Samson was a young boy who rode a motorscooter with his dog Goliath. Whenever trouble surfaced, Samson would slam his magic bracelets together above his shoulders to explosively transform into a more biblical and mightier version of himself. For added help, Samson would slam his bracelets again toward Goliath transforming the pooch into a massive lion. In lion form Goliath could fire laser beams from his eyes and leap incredible distances in a single bound.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475755</url></doc>
