<plot>Rohan Arya lives a wealthy lifestyle in Mumbai and is a professional singer with Showbiz, which is managed by Inder Raj Bahl, while Rohan's personal Manager is Shikha Verma. Rohan and Shikha are attracted to each other, and after Journalist Sharad Rajpoot publishes their photographs, both publicly announce their forthcoming engagement. Then chaos enters their lives when Rohan's car is involved in an accident while he is in the company of a prostitute named Tara. Shikha refuses to have to do anything with him, while a frenzied media focuses in on Rohan's personal life - especially after word gets out that he may have known Tara before he met Shikha.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494778</url></doc>
