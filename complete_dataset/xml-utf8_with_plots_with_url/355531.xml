<plot>Phillip Bennett and Louise Hammond, engaged to be married, are returning from her home after the engagement party, and Phillip is apparently killed in an automobile accident. Dr. Clarke is called and asked to bring Phillip back to life as he has been able to do so on animals. Panino, a vicious criminal, is to be electrocuted that same night at midnight. Dr. Clarke performs his operation a few minutes before this, and as Panino dies his soul enters Phillip's body, and he lives. Phillip is brought home but seems to have amnesia, as he does not recognize any one. He goes instinctively for Panino's haunts, and gradually assumes leadership of the gang and its business. Hobart Bennet, Phillip's father, becomes worried because of his newly-developed attitude and continued absence from home. A crime wave and gang-war breaks out in the city, with many killings. Mr. Bennett and Dr. Clarke go to the gang's hideout, and both are recognized by other gangsters. They question the men regarding Phillip's connection with the gangsters, and tell them that Phillip is Bennett's son. Phillip/Panino learns of this and murders the members of the gang who have found out his identity, but doesn't know that a brother of one of the slain men also knows the secret. The brother tips the police about a robbery Phillip has planned but he escapes the trap and returns home. He kills a detective that has followed him, but is in turn killed by Dr. Clarke.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355531</url></doc>
