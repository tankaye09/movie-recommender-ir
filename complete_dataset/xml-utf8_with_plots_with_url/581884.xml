<plot>In the near future, the writer Leonard Mead is a man broken by the death of his wife. He walks every night to visit with her at her graveside. However, the society in which he lives is controlled, fearful and television-obsessed. Walking after dark is strictly prohibited. On this night, Mead is forced to face the consequence of his 'crime' as the authorities chase him to an exciting climax.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581884</url></doc>
