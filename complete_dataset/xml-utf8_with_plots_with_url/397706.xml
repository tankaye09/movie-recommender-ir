<plot>Footage from a 1984 performance at the Church Street Station Theatre in Orlando features The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band with special guests Stella Parton and Gus Harding. On both the rock and pop as well as the country charts, The Nitty Gritty Dirt band has had hit records in five different decades.. Younger contemporaries of the Byrds, they played a role in the transformation from folk-rock into country-rock, and were an influence on such bands as the Eagles and Alabama. The band have since performed and recorded with any number of country/bluegrass crossover artists, including John Hiatt, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Rosanne Cash.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?397706</url></doc>
