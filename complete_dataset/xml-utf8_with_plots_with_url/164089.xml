<plot>Damon is a down-on-his-luck commercial photographer scratching for every mundane, boring job he can get just to survive. To underscore his plight we see him shooting publicity photos of a business woman with dental braces as we are introduced to him at the story's beginning. To make matters worse his live-in girlfriend announces that she is moving back in with her parents. He hooks up with an art gallery owner who fulfills both his sexual and professional needs, at least temporarily. Then comes his epiphany: he realizes that when he looks through the lens of his camera, he sees not only the sexy model who is there, but also her ultimate goals and aspirations that she doesn't know, herself. Will his newfound "extra sexual perception" play into a plan to get his old live-in lover back, or will he be happy in the gallery owner's bed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164089</url></doc>
