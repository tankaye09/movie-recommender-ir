<plot>In Don't Trip ... He Ain't Through with Me Yet, Harvey continues to relate his unique views on church, children, African-American culture and families. The faith-based community has enjoyed Harvey's spin on "church life" since he began participating in MegaFest over three years ago. Harvey retains his "keep it real" attitude while delivering hysterical insights on everyday situations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?155791</url></doc>
