<plot>'When Life Gives You Lemons' - a state of mind and business motto for Timothy Adoleman, President &amp; CEO of Lemon Corp. This mockumentary follows a day in the life of an entrepreneur on the cusp of success as he hires a film crew to produce a promotional video for potential investors who may want franchise rights in the quick service beverage industry. Things don't quite go as planned and by the end of the day we find that this dreamer has his hands full. Between neighborhood kids, his well meaning mother and his delusions of grandeur he'll be lucky to survive the day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652978</url></doc>
