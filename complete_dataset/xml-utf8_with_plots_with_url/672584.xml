<plot>After Bapujirao Nagvekar betrays widower Vishnu Chavan, and takes over his land. Vishnu swears to avenge this, relocates to the city along with his son, Shyam, and after working for years as a laborer, passes away - but not before asking Shyam to avenge this humiliation. Shyam is unemployed, but after rescuing Reshma, DSP Thorat, hires him as a Sub-Inspector, and assigns him to Daryapur. This is where Shyam will meet with Reshma again, both will fall in love with each other, with blessings from her father, Siddharth Anant Phadke, a known political opponent of MLA Bapujirao. Shyam decides to fulfill his father's dying wish and arrests some of Nagvekar's goon. It is then Shyam will find himself alienated from his very own peers, be instructed to release Nagvekar's goon, and must also deal with the sudden disappearance of Reshma and her dad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?672584</url></doc>
