<plot>Pran Nath lives a poor life-style with his wife and young son, Sanju. On 12Dec, Sanju's birthday, the police raid his house, find stolen jewelery that belongs to his employer, he is arrested, tried in court, found guilty, and sentenced to 3 years in prison. On the way to the prison, there is an accident and all travelers are killed. His wife and Sanju re-locate, but Sanju is abducted by Chinaramu, &amp; trained to be a criminal at a young age. Years later, Sanju has grown up, is now known as Shankar, has no knowledge of his parents' whereabouts, and is a career criminal. He comes to the rescue of a village belle named Champa and both fall in love. They find out that Champa's brother, Birju, is in jail, arrested for murder. Both know that Birju is not guilty, and swear to find out who the killer is. Before they could anything, Shankar himself is arrested and held in a cell - and the charge is cold-blooded murder of a pregnant woman named Seema. Watch what happens when Champa finds out that Shankar may have been two-timing her, leaving the onus on her alone to get evidence to free Birju.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104541</url></doc>
