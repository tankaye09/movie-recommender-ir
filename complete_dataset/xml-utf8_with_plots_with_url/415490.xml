<plot>ORGIES AND THE MEANING OF LIFE is an eccentric and exciting film illuminating the inner and outer life of Baxter Goode, a man trying to find an ending to his book (about a sex obsessed stick figure searching for a portal to the three dimensional world) even as his father, a best selling Christian author, tries to stop him. His life is further complicated by his search for the 'one', a woman he is sure will liberate him from his long addiction to orgy fantasies. Both of these pursuits are somehow connected to God, who may or may not be a stick figure, and Baxter's lesbian roommate, who may or may not be imaginary. Employing live action, animation, and experimental story techniques to explore existential, professional, and sexual crisis, ORGIES AND THE MEANING OF LIFE promises to be one of the more unique movie going experiences you will ever have.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415490</url></doc>
