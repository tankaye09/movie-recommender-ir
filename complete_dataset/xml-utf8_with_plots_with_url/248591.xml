<plot>John, a flaky but basically decent young man, hits his head during an earthquake and wakes up convinced he's the new John the Baptist. Elizabeth, a beautiful young nurse who lives in his apartment building in Venice Beach helps him find the true meaning in this bizarre message. They convince themselves they're supposed to save the world in 24 hours - or at least most of the Westside. Zack, John's skeptical roommate and rival for Elizabeth's attentions, thinks that either John is nuts or he's just using his supposed "Prophet Power" as a line to meet women. A whacked out chase ensues as each member of this hapless love triangle examines their hearts: Do they really believe what they're pretending or do they just want to get, er, lucky at the end of the world?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248591</url></doc>
