<plot>Chapter one closed with the family bonds of affection seemingly shattered beyond repair. Brother against Sister, Father against Son. Chapter Two opens with a message of hope and reconciliation provided by a mysterious and beautiful messenger. A message given to a father, who quite frankly, has been MIA. A father who's past actions and omissions have laid the foundation for the present chaotic situation. There is also the brother who has never fully matured and is prone to childish rantings and sibling rivalry. Then there is the daughter who is slowly losing grip of reality. She is struggling with internal issues real or imagined? Her sanity is at risk.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220099</url></doc>
