<plot>The panther, desperate for a place to sleep, lies down on a sofa in a hotel lobby, but the hotel detective orders him to leave. When the panther notices a convention is about to take place in the hotel, he disguises himself as one of the convention members and manages to sneak into an upper floor. The detective, who has noticed his disguise, chases the panther, who sneaks into the room of an obese man. The man's snoring keeps the panther awake, so he hides in the man's trousers and leaves the room. He mistakenly awakens the sleeping detective, but avoids being captured, and so he leaves the hotel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201176</url></doc>
