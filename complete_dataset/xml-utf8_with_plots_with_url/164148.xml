<plot>After the collapse of the universal government (Colonial Council) and the hypergate system of space travel, new governments arose across outer space. Having survived a devastating rebel war, some people bound together to form the Federation of United Planets. After several hundred years, the intent of rogues within the Federation became clear, and Commander Krane, head of the Bureau of Internal Investigation (the corrupt, controlling agency of the Federation), began her quest to slaughter anyone that does not obey the Federation, including native alien races. Universal war is raged between the native races, the Federation, space pirates, and Federation rebels that wish to topple the Bureau of Internal Investigation and restore democracy to the people. The player takes on the role of an inexperienced pilot in this universe that has been devastated by war. The decisions that the player makes will lead him or her on a massive role-playing quest that ultimately reaches one of six endings. Whether the Bureau of Internal Investigation collapses or triumphs depends on the decisions of the lone pilot that the player assumes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164148</url></doc>
