<plot>The documentary is a road-boat movie in 6 typical cities of Zhejiang Province in South Eastern China. The journey starts from Hangzhou, a modern city and ends in Xitang, an ancient water town in a hide and seek game between the camera and Chin-Chin, a little girl who prefers to take a walk to the old town rather than going to school. The camera becomes the spectator's eye aiming to hypnotize in such a way that you don't really know if people are traveling in the picture or the picture is moving in their heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159587</url></doc>
