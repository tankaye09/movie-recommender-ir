<plot>Did you ever imagine how ludicrous you would look with your mouth stretched from ear to ear and your sides shaking with laughter watching some funny comedian like Johnny Ray or Fred Stone doing stunts. Well we have a picture here that is the most laughable hit ever photographed. During an open air matinee at a summer park a Polyscope operator placed his camera back on the stage. A small aperture was made for the lens of the taking camera and the "gallery gods" were totally oblivious of the fact that they were being photographed. An uproarously amusing knockabout act was in progress on the stage at the time and the expression on the faces of the "under roofers" is a study as deep as the Darwinian theory. In fact some of the spectators look like apes, and their grimaces and gestures make you laugh until your sides ache. It is funnier than any act on the stage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208987</url></doc>
