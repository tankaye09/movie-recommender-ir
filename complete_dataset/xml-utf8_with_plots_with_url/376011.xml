<plot>Mumbai, India -- Present Day. The sweltering dead heat of the Indian summer. The only hope for relief are the elusive monsoon rains, already 3 weeks delayed. Into this sweaty inferno comes Govinda, a hotshot Californian Cardiologist and atheist who has journeyed back to his native country to treat his father's ailing health. Govinda despises India almost as much as he does his father who embraces it. It is dirty, disorganized, superstitious and the place where his beloved wife was killed in a tragic accident. Much to his frustration, his father, a devout Hindu Brahmin and the hard headed patriarch of the family, refuses medical treatment claiming that only God can heal him. As the tension between father and son grows, Govinda gets drawn back into the mystery surrounding his wife's death stirring up old skeletons that threaten to split the family apart forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376011</url></doc>
