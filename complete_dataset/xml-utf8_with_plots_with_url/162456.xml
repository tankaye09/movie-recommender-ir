<plot>A moody atmospheric documentary, which uses the annual Cork Jazz Festival as a backdrop, to allow a diverse range of musicians participating at the event to both talk about and demonstrate, through individual performances, their appreciation for this musical genre. Each year at the Guinness Cork Jazz Festival, hundreds of musicians from around the world are attracted to Ireland's Second City to perform their own distinctive brand of Jazz. The camera follows a number of prominent musicians around Cork as they talk about and play jazz at the various festival venues. Highlights include New York's Peter Bernstein Quartet playing Yesterdays and Russia's Valery Pomonovov performing Cole Porters' Love for Sale , amongst others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162456</url></doc>
