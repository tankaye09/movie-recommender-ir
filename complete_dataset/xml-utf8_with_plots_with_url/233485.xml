<plot>Ashton Jones is a singer/songwriter from New Mexico, who has been kicked out of his house by his wife and forced to go back and live at his father's house, until he can figure out how he can support his family. Told through the voice of Ashton's daughter Sage, the film follows their struggles of live, loss, identity and ultimately, being forced to saying goodbye. Ashton's expression is best communicated through his songs, which anger his conservative father, who supports the war in Iraq, but it is when he loses that voice, that his daughter takes things into her own hands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233485</url></doc>
