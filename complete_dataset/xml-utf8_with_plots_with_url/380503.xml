<plot>The true story of Maura O'Halloran, who at the age of 24 left her waitress job in Boston to go to Japan. She was ordained as a Zen monk and took on the extremely intense Zen practice of the Japanese male temple. Her ordination name was Soshin (Pure Heart, Enlightened Mind.) After three-years of rigorous training, O'Halloran received Dharma transmission. Officially a Zen Master/Roshi, she decided she would teach in her homeland of Ireland. But first she would take a trip. Just months later, in Thailand, she was killed in a road accident on a bus. She was 27.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380503</url></doc>
