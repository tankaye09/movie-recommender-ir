<plot>High school student Joe Daily finds himself in the border between reality and Star Wars, where he is on an Earthlike moon around the Yavin-like gas giant planet, instead of on Earth. But, he is jolted back to reality by his school teacher, Ms. Herzbaucher, to prove the Pythagorean theorem. He did with the little help of the prettiest girl in school, Sarah Parker, but, as one of his school bullies, Jimmy Denton, who is known to be Darth Maul, goes to the boys' restroom. Joe follows him, but eventually injures Maul, only to be caught by Darth Vader, who, in reality, is Mr. Anderson. Joe and Jimmy are taken into the office, where Joe meets Sarah's mother. He is then taken to the principal's office, where is tormented by Force Lightning fired by Emperor Palpatine, in reality, he gets beaten on his back by principal Mr. Korowski. On his way back to class, he gets scolded by Sarah's mother. As soon as the classmates have left the class, Joe effortlessly clears all "I love Sarah Jessica Mary Louise Parker" papers in the corridor, only to end up in the teachers' lounge and the library. Sarah is there, reading. He tells her he loves her, but he is actually looking from the bookshelves. Joe goes out, only to have the "I love Sarah Jessica Mary Louise Parker" speaking until Sarah tells Joe that he must not "be afraid". He takes out his plaster on his forehead, and returns to the library, where he joins Sarah to eat ice cream on their way back from school.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411639</url></doc>
