<plot>When devoted mother and journalist, Maggie, falls upon a story that will outrage religious leaders and spark a political outcry, it is a story she cannot ignore. Yet all she can think about is the consequences that lay ahead if she publishes the story. With the paper's editor against her and strongly voicing his opinion, she does what she feels is right. Maggie hears the argument over and over again in her head, her editor voicing his beliefs against the story, but Maggie only hears the facts of the story and believes that she is in the right and the public deserve the right to know what is taking place in the UK. As a mother and journalist, Maggie searches for the truth, only taking her further into unknown religious beliefs, to the back street surgeries and closer to the truth. Take Notice looks at a subject many people are naive to and asks the question. Does female circumcision really take place here on our doorstep?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529248</url></doc>
