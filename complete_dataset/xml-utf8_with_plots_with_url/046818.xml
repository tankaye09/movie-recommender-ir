<plot>When two children are touring an art gallery with the aide of a handheld speaker guide, the guide comes to life and takes them to another world called Artscape to teach them about the basics of art in more detail. Soon, the kids and the guide are separated and the kids must explore their world and people in it to find their way home, and along the way, they learn more about the visual arts than they ever dreamed possible.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046818</url></doc>
