<plot>In "Franken Pooh", Piglet is trying to tell a not-so-scary story, but Tigger makes it scary. Dr. Von Piglet creates the Monster Franken Pooh, who rampages, looking for honey! In "Things That Go Piglet In The Night", Eeyore is trying to learn how to swing at night time, because he doesn't get a chance during the day. But Piglet thinks he's a monster when he hears him yowling and covers himself with a pillowcase to hide, but everyone else thinks he's a ghost and they go on a wild 'ghost' chase, trying to capture the 'ghost'. In "Pooh Moon", the gang go on a camping trip, and when Piglet and Pooh decide to guard the corn, they fall asleep and the fire pops the corn and they believe they have gotten popped to the moon. But Tigger, Rabbit and Gopher believe they've been grabbed by the Grab Me Gotcha.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658218</url></doc>
