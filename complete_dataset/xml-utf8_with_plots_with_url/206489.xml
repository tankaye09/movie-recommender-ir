<plot>Alvaro Penja Rochas was active in the Chilean rock music scene of the 1960s, made a career in the advertising business and finally stranded in London in the early 1970s. He founded the band "The 101ers" together with Joe Strummer, with whom he lived in a squat. Before the 101ers went on recording, Alvaro left the band, forming his own "Alvaro Trio" and performing his so-called "Transitional Music". Alvaro's first LP "Drinking My Own Sperm" was widely acknowledged as a piece of fine and outstanding music, but financial success never stayed with Alvaro. In the early 1980s he moved to the town of Konstanz in Germany, where he's still living today. He is a poor man in his early 60s, living on state welfare, but he refuses to be anything else but a professional musician. The movie "Full Dedication ALVARO" focuses on the artists life in Konstanz and introduces the people who are with Alvaro since a long time, as is his ex-wife Hilde, his fellow band member Jens-Peter or musical wizard Frieder Butzmann, who analyzes Alvaro's famous song "Why Wasn't I Made Out Of Wood".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206489</url></doc>
