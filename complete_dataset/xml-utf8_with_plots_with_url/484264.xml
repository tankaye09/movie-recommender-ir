<plot>Set in the North Lake Tahoe area of Northern California, our protagonist (Kevin) wakes up to find himself in bed with a dead woman (Jessie). He convinces his best friend (Ben) to help him find out the truth surrounding her death, but before they find out anything, a blackmail artist (Sean) contacts them with intricate details about the murder. Sean threatens to leak the information to the police unless he's paid to keep his mouth shut. Kevin faces a choice: pay money to clear himself of a murder that he may not have committed...or face his own shadowy past and finally tell the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484264</url></doc>
