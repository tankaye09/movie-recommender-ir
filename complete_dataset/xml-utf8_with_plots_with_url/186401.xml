<plot>Life After Porn is a documentary that focuses on what happens to both male and female "porn stars" after they have left the adult entertainment business. Through the interviewing process, we will examine their roots, how they got started, why they left, and how their lives have turned out. Briefly, their past lives will be touched upon as to ascertain how they ended up doing porn, as will their porn careers subsequent to their departure from the "business." Ultimately, however, we want to focus upon exactly where they are in their lives outside of the xxx business. Intertwined with this, there will be interviews with various "experts," in the field of pornography, pop culture, and mainstream entertainment, as well as psychologists, authors, and sociologists. Life After Porn, isn't a "where are they now" piece. People that work as porn stars often drop the career (or the career drops them) so abruptly, that it's tantamount to going into the witness protection program. Several well known and not so well known performers will be interviewed. They were Ivy Leaguers, soldiers, prodigies, and stock brokers. Some are dead; some are family men/women. Many struggle with the decision to go back, others never gave it a second thought. Ultimately, the question is asked; "Now that you've started your life anew, how did you do it? And how or what, is your life after porn?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186401</url></doc>
