<plot>A sturdy man with a dark expression follows a delicate beauty, clad in innocent white clothes, through the streets of Manila. In his attempt to keep her away from the trash and vice of the metropolis, he becomes a murderer. Sometimes he simply stands around with his arms folded, observing people in the streets and unleashing tirades of hatred in the form of an inner monologue. Yet at the same time, he repeatedly proceeds to horrible crimes, which he considers himself chosen to commit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362276</url></doc>
