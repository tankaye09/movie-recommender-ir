<plot>This program aims to take a group of 15 dysfunctional men and turn their lives around through the medium of football. The men all face one or more present day life issues, including too much drinking, too much smoking, poor diet, anger management, depression, confidence and gambling. Ex-premiership footballer and self-confessed ex-alcoholic, Neil Ruddock takes the manager position, along with Justin Edinburgh at his side as coach. Using a team of experts including Dr. Adam Carey from Celebrity Fit Club fame (Nutrition and Diet), Angie Dowds from TV's The Biggest Loser(Personal Training) and Keith Power (Sport psychology and mental health), the team plans to get this group of everyday guys fit, healthy, happier and on the road to a better future. Celebrity football stars are introduced to give the "team" tips and tricks to help them on the road to their full 90minute match against ex-pros.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199439</url></doc>
