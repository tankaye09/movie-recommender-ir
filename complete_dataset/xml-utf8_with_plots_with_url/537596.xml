<plot>Featuring members of the 1931 National Champion football team from the University of Southern California Trojans, with team members Russell Saunders and Oscar "Dutch" Hendrian also cast in roles other than just team members. Former USC football player John Wayne (not on the 1931 team) and Olympic swimmer Buster Crabbe also in cast as football players: Thomas Jefferson "Snakehips" Scott (Richard Cromwell, definitely cast against type)is the sensation of the Freshman football squad at Bedford University. After a sensational Sophomore season, varsity coach "Daisy" Adams (Douglass Dunbrille) gets him a summer "job" in the Maine woods as a bond salesman. The coach sends him there for conditioning purposes only, but Tommy is pleased with the $6,000 he gets for selling bonds he never even sees. Nice work if you can get it and, seventy years later, college football players (usually from Texas and California, playing for colleges from some other states that can't "grow their own")still manage to find similar positions. Tommy, figuring that there is more where this came from, tells a graduate manager he will quit the team unless they pay him $50,000. The manager arranges with a broker to start an investment fund named after Thomas Jefferson Smith, the receipts from which will net Tommy his demanded amount. Thousands of shares are sold, for unclear reasons since the buyers had no reason to expect a return, but, hey, the plot must move along. The broker gambles away the funds. The broker kills himself. The district attorney questions Tommy. The father of Tommy's college squueze offers Tommy $50,000 if he will break his engagement to the girl. Tommy holds out for $100,000. Tommy is booed off the field after the first half of "the BIG GAME." Tommy has sent the $100,000 to the district attorney to pay off the investors. The D.A. tells the newspapers. The newspapers print special editions that are delivered to the stadium at half-time. Tommy receives a standing ovation from the crowd. Tommy scores the winning touchdown. Mom Scott (Mae Marsh)is proud of Tommy, for reasons hard to discern.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?537596</url></doc>
