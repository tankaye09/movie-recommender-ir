<plot>Grandpa is absorbed in a daily paper, near an open window. A spoony bicycle couple dismount down the lane to re-arrange a portion of the lady's toilet and attract the old gentleman's attention. His somewhat impaired eyesight causes him to resort to his trusty field glass in order to better watch the operation. A very apparent improvement in the view affects the old gentleman to such a degree that it is not approved of by his elderly spouse, who appears on the scene at the time and proceeds to demolish the field glass, thus putting an abrupt end to the old gentleman's investigations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391265</url></doc>
