<plot>This provocative film studies the evolution of Egyptian society from the early 20th century to today, focusing on the status of women as experienced by several generations within the same family. The women discuss the intergenerational changes that have affected fashion, politics and courtship as well as society's role for women in general. The achievements made by past leaders of the Egyptian women's rights movement are also highlighted here: In the early 1900s, Nabaweya Moussa pushed for equality in the field of education. Mounira Sabet, a lawyer in the mixed courts, fought for equal rights for women in the workplace. By using old home movies, photographs and the verbal experiences of women young and old, WOMEN'S CHITCHAT provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of Egyptian women over the past one hundred years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660238</url></doc>
