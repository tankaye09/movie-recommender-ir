<plot>In 1942, my grandmother was forced to leave her Russian village, which had been burnt down by the German army. She was twenty-five years old at the time, and died thirty-six years later, here in France. I was ten years old then. I knew little about her. 65 years later I went to Russia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?326133</url></doc>
