<plot>Arjun Singh comes from a very poor family. He lives in a small and shabby tenement with his mom and sister. Despite of his circumstance, he is honest and helpful. This puts him into conflict with Bhai, a notorious gangster. In order to teach Arjun a lesson, Bhai orders people in this community to stop interacting with Arjun and his family, and as a result the three are alienated. His sister is raped, and his mother passes away. Then Bhai has Arjun captured and chained.
