<plot>Advocate Anand Saxena lives in a small apartment with his wife, Kavita, who came from a wealthy family, and their young son. They live in a crime-prone area as Anand cannot afford to live in a better locality, due to his honesty and integrity. Almost daily they are mocked at, made fun of, and even have their motor-cycle burned at the hands of the goonda elements, led by Captain Dada, who owes allegiance to criminal don, Uncle Kalra. Then Captain Dada meets and falls in love with Anshu Mehra, and introduces himself as Vijay. He changes his character to impress Anshu, and even befriends Kavita. He takes Anshu to meet Kavita, and that's when Anand rips off the mask of respectability from Captain's face, with Anshu having her heart broken, and refusing to have anything to do with him again. He manages to convince Anshu that he is a changed person and she gets him to promise to give up all criminal activity, which he does. Uncle Kalra, however, does not see it his way, and asks his men to kill him at any cost, additionally he wants his son, Raj, to marry Anshu. Now Captain is on the run from Kalra's men, and also from the police as he finds out that Anshu is the niece of Police Commissioner Mehra, who will not leave any stone unturned to capture and kill Captain at any cost - and write off his death as a "Police Encounter".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317292</url></doc>
