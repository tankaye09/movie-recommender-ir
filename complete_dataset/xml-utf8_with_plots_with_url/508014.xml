<plot>Join Deepak Chopra, M.D. in an exploration of scientific medicine and the healing wisdom traditions of the world. Bringing to life the underlying promise that healing, wholeness and that which is holy are differentiated expressions of a single underlying reality, Dr. Chopra offers insights and practical demonstrations to help you take control of your health and healing needs. Hosted at the prestigious Beth Isreal Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, and The Chopra Center in Carlsbad, California, Dr. Chopra offers a framework for the healing process, as well as instructions on meditation, stress relief, and how to invoke your inner pharmacy using sight, sound, smell, taste and touch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?508014</url></doc>
