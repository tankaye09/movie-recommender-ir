<plot>Five years after legendary climber Alex Lowe was swept away by an avalanche, Lowe's friends and family honor his memory by returning to the Himalayas to establish the Khumbu Climbing School. Designed to give back to the Sherpa climbers on whom nearly all Himalayan expeditions depend, the school teaches critical mountaineering techniques and skills essential for staying alive in one of the world's most formidable working environments. As the instructors and Sherpas work together to bring the school to life, it becomes apparent that mountains aren't the only bond they share.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573403</url></doc>
