<plot>A fairly dark room. small and discreet. Four players, a dealer, poker table, cards, and chips. Everybody continues to study each other's expression looking for the slightest sign they could find, placing their bets. Tension was felt between two players in the room. History lies between them both. Ben and Jack. Jack, being the most 'powerful' one, has his lady, Mia beside him, watching him play. Ben, by himself like the rest of the players, he's the most relaxed one in the table. Ben keeps winning. On the last hand, Jack, having double pairs, goes all-in to take Ben off but Ben called the raise as he has the straight with him. The money was all he has too, he was confident of the cards in his hands. So again, Ben wins over Jack, it was a big sum of money. Jack got furious, handed over a gun to his lady. She stood up and walks towards Jack and points the gun on his head. He slowly stood up and whispers to Mia, kisses her while looking over to Jack with all the satisfaction that he has. As she lowers her hand, Ben reaches it to grab the gun. This time, it was Ben, pointing the gun at her head.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200149</url></doc>
