<plot>Hank meets Henry on the prison basketball court. It's Hank's first day in, Henry's last. Henry challenges Hank to a game of H-E-N-R-Y, a version of the playground basketball game H-O-R-S-E. The wager is for Hank's basketball, the only possession he's got. With each shot comes a new reality. Hank and Henry discover that despite the difference in their circumstance, they are more similar than first perceived. When the game concludes the two are connected in a profound and surprising way. Shot on location inside and outside of the historic Stillwater prison, H-E-N-R-Y provides a unique perspective on confinement, using a lyrical, atmospheric tone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226212</url></doc>
