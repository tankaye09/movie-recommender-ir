<plot>A couple wake up one morning, John and Nikki. It's Nikki's birthday and all she wishes for is one simple request. "You never make me breakfast in bed," she cries. Her boyfriend looks over to her, fixes her hair, and assures her in a most cunning manner, "Okay, but on one condition..." John takes Nikki into the kitchen and proceeds to disrobe her, piece by erotic piece. He picks her up and places her on top of their kitchen counter. You know the old saying "be careful what you wish for?" Well, Nikki learns that lesson the hard way as John begins the task of making Nikki the breakfast she asked for, in a most creative, sadistic/masochistic vein. In this sick fantasy world, Nikki will literally become one of John's many cooking utensils.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082190</url></doc>
