<plot>A vagabond runs into a girl on her way to work. Her beauty captures his heart. He follows into her work place in hopes of winning her love. To avoid security he hides in an office where he is mistaken as an executive. He takes a meeting with another large company and signs a deal. With Security in hot pursuit, the Vagabond attempts to get out to the building, but as he does he find her. She accepts his offer for lunch and they leave together. This fun style film is done in honor of Charlie Chaplin and Robert Downey, Jr who portray Chaplin. It starts off in the black and whit flicker of old film footage and dissolves into modern day color.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?533131</url></doc>
