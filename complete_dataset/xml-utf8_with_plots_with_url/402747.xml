<plot>This is the story of Benjamin and the one evening that will change his life once and for all. Benjamin's life is a dichotomy of order and chaos, Benjamin does his duty for his boss and endures an unconventional relationship with the alluring Alice. On the outside everything looks transparent, but in reality Benjamin is a ticking time bomb. Everything in Benjamin's life has been stolen by Adam and now he has been reduced to almost the level of a dog by the crime boss. But this is the evening everything changes; Benjamin's numbness is fading and his fury has taken over. Nothing can stop Benjamin from settling the score that has been boiling inside him for five years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402747</url></doc>
