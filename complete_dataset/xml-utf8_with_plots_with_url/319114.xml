<plot>The inspiration of this project comes from the ancient paper lanterns, which I see as a miracle as it carries fire within paper. With the burning energy inside its fragile shell, a lantern illuminates itself and its surroundings, until it dies out. This process resembles a life journey where one's inner ego is the ultimate energy source. In Lantern, a cube with a small enclosed sphere is used to symbolize a life unit. The minimalist touch in the style is adopted in an effort to direct the audiences' attention to the inner struggle within each unit, as well as the relation between different elements. The Chinese ink paintings, seals and calligraphy are digitally recreated to produce the serene appearance of the piece, suggesting a sense of harmony and balance of life as seen in traditional oriental culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319114</url></doc>
