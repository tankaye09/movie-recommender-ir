<plot>A lover and his sweetheart are seated in the park billing and cooing, and, as usual, they are oblivious to everything by which they are surrounded. The lover leaves his girl for a moment and a tramp who has been watching them takes his place. He imitates the lover until the girl discovers that he is not the "real thing," when she cries for help. The lover returns, while the girl flees, and the tramp is dumped into the stream close by. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596760</url></doc>
