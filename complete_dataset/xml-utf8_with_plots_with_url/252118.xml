<plot>Jane, an awkward young woman, buys a second hand car. Over the coming days, one by one she discovers items left in the car. There seems to be a theme developing in her discoveries: a Swedish landscapes book, then a Swedish language speaking CD and all in her new Saab. For introverted Jane, these seemingly coincidental discoveries provide an opportunity to create a fantasy world less hostile to the one she lives in. As her confidence and Swedish vocabulary grow, she starts to gain confidence she never had before. Finally she decides to step out of the sheltered life she has been confined to and venture into a new and brighter world. Armed with an appreciation of Swedish design, a slim grasp of basic conversational Swedish and a belief that this was meant to be, she begins to break out of her shell engage with people and the world in a way she has avoided her whole life, but not everything turns out the way she planned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252118</url></doc>
