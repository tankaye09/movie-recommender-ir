<plot>A story of one afternoon. The two main characters are Isu, living with his grandmother, and his friend Zoli. They are in their early twenties and make their living by petty crime. The film shows their picking to and passing on of a bigger batch of drugs, but the focus is not on the actual deal since the characters are seen in the dead time that passes between the phases of the transaction. Isu's past, his relationship with his father and his moving away from home, is also portrayed. This film is not about drugs but is rather a portrait in the style of small- scale realism depicting two Budapest little Valentinos of the 21st century.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629889</url></doc>
