<plot>When Marv is told he has recovered fully from lung cancer he refuses to believe it, convincing himself he died. His patient but neurotic wife Tracey has to bring him home and somehow get the message through to him that he is actually alive. Marv refuses to listen and seems to delight in " being a ghost" He runs around the Sydney opera house in his pajamas, oblivious to all the stares he receives from the public. He is actually delighting in his new found position of no responsibilities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214339</url></doc>
