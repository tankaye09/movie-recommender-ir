<plot>Return is the story of Danny, a little kid who goes to the shopping mall with his big sister. While she is hanging out with her friends, she loses sight of Danny. He wanders off, and the viewers are now free to see the world through a child's eyes. After crossing the freeway and L.A. River, Danny wanders into an old mausoleum, where a dark stranger stands over a grave, watching him suspiciously. The stranger, JOHN DOE engages the child in an existential conversation which leads the two disenfranchised figures to find a common bond, before John help Damny find his way back to his family at the shopping mall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461541</url></doc>
