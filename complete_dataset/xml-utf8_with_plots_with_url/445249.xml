<plot>"It's like Hands on a Hardbody meets Trekkies!" See what happens when Austin DJ &amp; first time filmmaker Jenn Garrison turns the camera onto the world of radio to learn more about the industry's unique groupies. PrizeWhores is a documentary about a group of people who have formed their own 'community' based upon their extreme hobby of attending radio-station remotes, movie premiers and rock concerts. They coordinate their lives based upon these events. They are actually called 'prizewhores' by the staff of the radio stations, music venues and movie houses they frequent. As you will learn, winning is fun. But, it aint the only thing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445249</url></doc>
