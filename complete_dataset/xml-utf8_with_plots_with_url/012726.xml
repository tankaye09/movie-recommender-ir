<plot>Each year thousands of people from all around the world arrive in Los Angeles driven by dreams of fame and fortune. One such man was aspiring comic, Gaylord Dingler. Gaylord arrived in 1977, standing shoulder to shoulder with David Letterman, Jay Leno and Andrew Dice Clay on the bottom rung of Hollywood's Comedy Store 'Open Mic' scene. 27 years later Gaylord was still there, performing the same 3 minute act. But Gaylord's legend had grown in its own peculiar way, and when Pauly Shore shocked everyone by putting Dingler on stage in the Main Room at the Comedy Store on New Years Eve, it looked like Gaylord would have his shot at fame, his 15 minutes were surely just around the corner but then, just weeks after his Main Room triumph, Gaylord vanished! Gaylord had rarely missed an 'Open Mic' in 27 years - the rumor mill buzzed and the accusations flew. Had aliens finally got him? Had Governor Schwarzenegger really taken out a contract on his life? Or had his best friend murdered him in a fight over a burger? Digging deeper into the surreal legend of Gaylord Dingler, we find he was both an inspiration and a nightmare for many of Hollywood's up and coming comedians and as the jokes and stories flow, our journey takes one last twist - we receive a late night call and we finally discover the fate of Gaylord Dingler! Investigating the legend of Gaylord Dingler taught us a lot of things; but most importantly we learned that 'if you never give up on your dreams, then success is just a state of mind'</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012726</url></doc>
