<plot>This scene is laid on the dock of a summer cottage on the Fulton Chain in the Adirondacks. Two young ladies have already embarked in an Adirondack canoe; but the fleshy young man, who is to take them out rowing, makes a misstep, overturning the canoe and throwing the ladies into the water, from which they are rescued with considerable difficulty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165006</url></doc>
