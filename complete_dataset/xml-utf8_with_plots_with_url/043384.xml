<plot>A cab driver gets up early one morning and starts writing a letter while getting ready for another day at work. Once his car starts rolling, the many thoughts inside his head go from one place to another, just like the passengers that come and go from his taxi. Thoughts of everything in general and life in particular. Shouldn't we spend more time appreciating today and less time worrying about tomorrow? Wouldn't it be wiser to believe in chocolate than God? We are taken on a trip inside the swiftly spinning head of the cab driver. But while following his inner journey, we are also on our way to a place much farther away, for to whom will the letter really be sent?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043384</url></doc>
