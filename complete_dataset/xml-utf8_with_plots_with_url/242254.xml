<plot>"Hurrah for Hobson and his brave crew! This hero is worthy of all the homage that has been paid to him, and more. There is only one Hobson. His successful and hazardous undertaking has endeared him to both young and old. On his appearance in the Jubilee parade the multitudes vied with each other to get near him, and many were moved to tears of joy on beholding a man, young as he is, who took his life in his hands for the welfare of his country. All hail to Hobson and his crew! This film is clear and brilliant. The faces are distinct and you cannot fail to recognize and indelibly stamp upon your mind the handsome features of our hero of the navy."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?242254</url></doc>
