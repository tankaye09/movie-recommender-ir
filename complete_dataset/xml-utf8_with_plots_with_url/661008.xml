<plot>Worldsong is a lyrical exploration of the universality of human life. From birth through death and starting the cycle again, Worldsong takes us through the common experiences of humans all around the world, using Jim Lang's beautiful score to carry us along the poignant emotional adventure. Designed to play for audiences of all ages from all cultures, it was the main attraction at the USA Pavilion at Expo 92 in Seville, Spain. It has won many awards including: Grand Prize for Best Short Film of 1992, at the Houston International Film Festival, Gold Hugo Award, Chicago International Film Festival, Golden Apple Award, and The Chris Award, at the Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661008</url></doc>
