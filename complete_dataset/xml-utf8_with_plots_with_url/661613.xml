<plot>A mini-documentary on the process and emotional significance of engraving headstones. Inspired by the poetic documentaries of the 1920s and Errol Morris' reflexive documentary style today, the director's goal was to create something distinctly cinematic as opposed to journalistic. This film was co-produced and graciously supported by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), CBC and the Independent Filmmakers Co-operative of Ottawa (IFCO).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661613</url></doc>
