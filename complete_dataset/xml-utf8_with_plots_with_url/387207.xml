<plot>The holiday in the East: the wife carries out precision work in white overcoat operating a machine at work, the deaf husband pushes a sack barrow. But at the datcha he is the one in command. The datcha is held together by more or less firmly fixed cardboard and tin pieces, only prevented from collapsing due to persistent efforts and sacrifices made by father and son. The car needs to be moved too - a task that requires the cumulated knowledge of the DIY man. Concentrated work, only to be topped by the professional repairing works of an undefined device, that later turns out to be a vacuum cleaner. Later follow eaves, television, radio, fridge, smoke - furnace and the car- over and over again the car. A holiday at the datcha is the last big challenge for our civilization.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?387207</url></doc>
