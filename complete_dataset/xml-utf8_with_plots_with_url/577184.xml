<plot>Don't believe the hype! The 2008 Presidential Race did not just occur on television, in debates and sound bytes. It occurred in households across America. This film is a gripping emotional portrayal of friends deliberating the presidential candidacy and learning that personalities and politics will clash and communication is the hardest thing of all. This film captures the sentiments and tensions of American voters with all the realism and none of the bias of media commentary. As the characters discuss their views, those in the audience will find themselves drawn into a compelling conversation. Here is a fresh look at how 2008 was the year the American people woke up and finally talked to each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577184</url></doc>
