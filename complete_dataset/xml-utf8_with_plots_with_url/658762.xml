<plot>"WishKid" was a Saturday morning animated series created to play off the success of pre-teen movie star Macaulay Culkin (of Home Alone). Nick McClary owned a magic baseball glove which, if punched three times, granted his every wish. Stories--which were introduced in live action by Culkin--revolved around Nick's wishes and the trouble that usually followed. Nick's best friend was Darryl, the only one in on the glove's secrets and usually became involved in the adventures. Nick was frequently harassed by Frankie Dutweiler, the neighborhood bully; other characters included neighbor Mrs. Opal, Nick's mom and dad and his baby sister, Katie (voiced by Macaulay's kid sister, Quinn. The show ran one year on NBC, with new episodes airing on the Family Channel in 1996 (along with the original 13 NBC episodes).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658762</url></doc>
