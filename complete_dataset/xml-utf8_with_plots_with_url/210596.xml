<plot>While Gaston LeCrayon is setting up his painting area on the sidewalk, a limousine zooms by and splashes mud all over the canvas. The wealthy woman, who was a passenger in that limousine, mistakes the mud-splashed canvas for "art" and invites Gaston to her mansion, wanting him to create a masterpiece with her expensive art supplies. Her husband, however, has different ideas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210596</url></doc>
