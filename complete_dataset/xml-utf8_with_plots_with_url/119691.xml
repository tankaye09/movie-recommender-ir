<plot>What happens to ordinary people after the war is over and the news cameras and aid workers have left? This is what Leon Gerskovic was determined to find out when he returned to his homeland -- what was once Yugoslavia. As he watched the news of Kosovo from the safety of his American living room, Gerskovic knew that he needed to go back to see how victims of earlier Balkan wars were coping. At the time, he had little idea of how much his own history would come back to haunt him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119691</url></doc>
