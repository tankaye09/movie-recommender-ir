<plot>The story centers on a Serbian man (NIKOLA) whose family was killed during the political uprising in Srebrenica in the 1990s. One day as he works alone in his tiny workshop, he discovers one of his puppets has fallen over a picture of his deceased son (PAVLE). Nikola believes that the puppet is his son returned from the dead. We watch as Nikola re-connects with his lost son and, in the process, his own humanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426758</url></doc>
