<plot>More than likely there will be differing memories about why two people got divorce depending on whether you speak with the couple who got divorced, their children, or extended family members. The recounting of the thoughts, feelings and memories connected to the divorced parents' relationship will always carry the attempt at making sense of what was going on then from the vantage point of the present. As Lorrie Moore says, 'The story of the trip will always be different than the trip.' In 'Family Matter,' the three filmmakers probe their own and their family's memories of certain moments that are either directly or potentially indirectly connected to their parents' divorce in hopes of uncovering a collective family memory surrounding the divorce. They are also interested in examining whether or not this collective memory is capable of being objective, or whether like the individual memories that are recounted, the collective will remain a collection of subjective points of view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188829</url></doc>
