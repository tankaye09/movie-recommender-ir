<plot>John Outis doesn't have a past. But his life history is being restored in the present and it's dramatically altering the lives of his friends, his wife, and his lover. As he begins to remember more, his past threatens to end his future until he receives the aid and guidance of Tina Plantes, a brilliant and unconventional physics professor. As she's drawn deeper into the bizarre events of John's life, she discovers a disturbing and far-reaching truth: time is not linear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?631512</url></doc>
