<plot>"Sbirri", Italian slang for the police, is the story of a well-known TV journalist who after the death of his son through ecstasy, decides to follow the drug squad in their fight against drug trafficking in Milan. The film takes us on his "real" journey in the world of drugs and his desperate search to find a valid reason, someone to blame for his son's pointless death and at the same time, for his sense of inadequacy as a parent. It's a journey in this incredible underworld where people from all social classes and thousands of young people are being constantly entrapped and where unknown heroes every day put their lives at risk in their battle against crime. All that is shown in the film is true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479562</url></doc>
