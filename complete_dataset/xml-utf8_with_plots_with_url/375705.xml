<plot>Shawna mops pizza-puke and runs kiddy rides for minimum wage at Monkey Junction-an experience that was bad enough before she figured out she's pregnant. Now she's supposed to get some freak out of the plastic tubes before the day's birthday parties begin. Ern's little daughter is dead and it's pretty much his fault. He can't face himself, his wife, or any of the rest of the world right now. That big tube playground at the amusement park seemed like the perfect plastic womb when he crawled inside; but now there's this snotty teenager yelling at him to get out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375705</url></doc>
