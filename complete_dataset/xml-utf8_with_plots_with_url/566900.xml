<plot>The Irish Rovers were formed, first as a duo, by George Millar &amp; his friend Jim Ferguson in Toronto in 1963. Both boys haled from Ireland. In 1994, George's cousin, Joe Millar emigrated to Canada &amp; was immediately seized for the group. They were joined by George's brother, Will Millar later that year in Calgary &amp; the group was on its way. After working successfully in California, where they intr√¥duced the song 'the Unicorn', the team returned, eventually to Canada where they began a variety show of Irish folk songs. Will Millar left the group in 1995 &amp; Jim Ferguson died in 1997. The Rovers now consist of six members including the original founder &amp; his cousin.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566900</url></doc>
