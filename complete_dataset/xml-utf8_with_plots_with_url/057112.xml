<plot>Where does one find the meaning of life? Perhaps it lies in the kitchen of sculptor Helene Simon, where she shows us how to make her world famous Baklava. Through a generous helping of her wisdom and insight about the process of creation, in both food and sculpture, we learn that true joy in life unfolds when we allow ourselves to do what we love. Helene Simon was born in Baghdad, Iraq, and educated at Bedford College in London. After studying Islamic art in Egypt, she came to the United States and continued her art education in New York City, where she still resides today. Approaching her fifties, she discovered sculpture, and for 30 years she created beautiful works in stone that are held in museums and private collections around the world. Along the way, she also made some wonderful Baklava. Now, you can too. Also directed by Jamil Simon: Nana: Un Portrait.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057112</url></doc>
