<plot>Janey Cooper was a small town girl who worshiped James Dean. Eddie Heller was a mysterious stranger with a dangerous obsession. Haunted by the legacy of James Dean, he emerged from the shadows to steal her away. Set against the backdrop of torrid teenage passion and screeching hot rods, "Riding with James Dean" is a provocative film that captures the spirit of teenage rebellion in the fifties. "We set out to do a film that was a more accurate depiction of the fifties without the nostalgic cliches, " says Director Tim Powell. "Our concept was to do a character-driven drama as if it had actually been made in 1956 with its deliberate pace, sweeping vistas and orchestrated music score."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?463340</url></doc>
