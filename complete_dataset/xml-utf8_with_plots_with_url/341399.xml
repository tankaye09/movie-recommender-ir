<plot>On assignment for public access TV, a documentary crew has one day to locate the elusive Dubinsky, a legend of New York's Lower East Side. Acting on a tip from a deranged homeless man, the crew runs into Dubinsky's mailman, Dubinsky's auto mechanic, Dubinsky's tailor - even Dubinsky's main squeeze - but no Dubinsky. How could one slow-moving geriatric manage to evade a squad of fleet-footed filmmakers? Is it a cover up? Is there really a Dubinsky after all?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341399</url></doc>
