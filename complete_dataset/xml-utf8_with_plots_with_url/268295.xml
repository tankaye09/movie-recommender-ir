<plot>Born to East Indian parents, Rashmi Mehra lives a wealthy and care-free life in England, often overspends money, leading her dad to question her closely. On one such occasion, she manages to convince him that she can earn as much as 5000 pounds in one month. He accepts her challenge and she sets out to find work. She soon finds out that it is not easy to get any job, especially without using her dad's name &amp; any job skills. She does manage to convince Radiowala of 'Suno' FM Radio to let her con a young man in falling in love with her, while she ditches him on a reality show. The young man, she has in mind is Raj, who also uses the alias of CBI Officer R.B. Mathur, who has come all the way from India to nab a gang of drug-dealers. She will soon find out that Raj, too, has an agenda in falling for her, as he wants to convince his to-be father-in-law, Talwar, that he is married, and Rashmi is his fresh-from-India bride. Things get comically complicated when the underworld get word of R.B. Mathur and abduct Rashmi.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268295</url></doc>
