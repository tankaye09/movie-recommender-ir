<plot>Ethics and integrity are at the forefront of Jim's gubernatorial campaign as he seeks to "make the people #1" in California 's historic recall race. With a shameless, passionate quest for office, Jim takes us on a whirlwind tour of the Golden State with buttons, bumper stickers and T-shirts to spare. His Oklahoma roots and no-nonsense attitude make this a fascinating journey to watch and the intimacy of the footage (shot by sister filmmaking team Lori and Kathleen Carr) is something rarely seen in politics, documentaries or life itself. Keeping in mind that the historic recall race will be history by the time this film is viewed, we have chosen to make a film about a man's passionate journey to become the change he wants to see in the world...not the California Recall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604718</url></doc>
