<plot>Soldiers march a condemned man through a rural area to a bridge high above a stream. While a boy plays a drum, one soldier puts a noose around the prisoner's neck and stand him on the bridge's parapet. He thinks of his wife and children, then falls. The rope breaks from his weight, and he stays under water until he's beneath some reeds on the surface. The soldiers fire at him and pursue, but he's able to leave the stream and run for his life. The sunshine, being alive, and thoughts of his wife and children propel him forward. Will he make it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546031</url></doc>
