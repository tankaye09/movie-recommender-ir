<plot>Programmer Alex regrets breaking up with dancer Sasha. He's invited her to an art show with every intention of winning her back. Showing up for their 'just friends' date 15 minutes early, Alex is determined to debug the situation and figure out what he has to say to undo their breakup. What he's not prepared for is dealing with the issues underneath his actions. Can he admit his true faults, deal with his issues and figure out that conversation to 'unbreak up' all in 15 minutes, or will he have to abort his plan?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?628814</url></doc>
