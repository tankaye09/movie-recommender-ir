<plot>Kenny Bee plays a free lance photographer. Although he is a nice guy, his lack of ability to assert himself decisively causes him to drift from one woman to another. He meets three women of first is a concubine of a millionaire. He circulates around the wealthy set in Hong Kong by accompanying her. He wants to go steady with her, but she has other ideas. He then meets a club hostess. She's serious about him but he's not. Then he meets a daughter of a millionaire who calls all her boyfriends "Simon", so he's introduced to everyone as "Simon". This relationship doesn't last long either. In the end he's the one who is alone by himself due to his indecisive behavior. The subplot of the movie is the way people take advantage of each other, and how Kenny's character gets caught in their play.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662609</url></doc>
