<plot>In the rolling hills of Southeast Ohio exists a movement of small-scale farmers who produce food without chemicals or significant mechanical input. For these visionary men and women of the earth, pesticides are an unnecessary hazard, while one's own sweat and toil proves more efficient than fossil-fueled machines. FARMING FOR THE FUTURE enters the fields to uncover the motivations of these forward-thinking yeomen, illuminating the subtler and oft-forgotten aspects of the vital commodity called food. Tromp through the fields of Athens County with this outspoken group of conscientious cultivators to witness sustainable alternatives to conventional methods, and find out what farmers really think about the state of food production in the United States today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?189993</url></doc>
