<plot>Vijay is a simple-minded widower who lives in a small rural town in India with his unmarried sister, Radha; his son; and his widowed mom. Radha is soon to be married to Sub-Inspector Raj. One day Vijay witnesses a killing of a young child by notorious bandit Bhagad Singh, and chides him. As a result, Bhagad and his gang severely beat him up, and only spare his life after Vijay's mom begs them to forgive him. But Lala Dayaluram hires Bhagad to ensure that Vijay and his family leave the town, and when they refuse Vijay is abducted, severely beaten and left for dead. An escaped convict and killer named Karan, who happens to be Vijay's exact look-alike, sees the unconscious Vijay, and decides to assume his identity, stabs him, and throws him to his death from atop a cliff. Karan then goes to live with his family. The motive for Karan to live here is merely to hide under Vijay's name until the police give up their manhunt for him. No one really notices the change in Vijay. Karan starts to frequent the nearby brothel run by Kammobai, and soon realizes that he can make a lot of money by selling young women to her. His first target that he intends to lure to Kammobai is none other than Radha, Vijay's sister. This is just one of the destructive methods he intends to employ in his new identity and there is no one who can dare to suspect nor stop him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287101</url></doc>
