<plot>A bank robber escapes across the Danish border and hides in a remote house at the west coast of Jutland (Denmark). But soon he gets an unpleasant visit by an obtrusive neighbor who wants far more than just satisfying his curiousity. Who is this man? Is he a cop trying to win the bank robbers trust? Is he just another bad guy trying to help an unexperienced bandit? It seems that the stranger from next door is actually enjoying to keep our antagonist confused.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417643</url></doc>
