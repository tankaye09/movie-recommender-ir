<plot>A TV crew is sent to the desert North of Chile, on assignment to cover an old train which was supposed to have been dismantled decades before. When the young journalist and his cameraman discover that the train is still running, a voyage begins whose destiny promises to remain unknown. The days pass while Daniel and Victor scout and film images without knowing the true meaning of their mission, rolling deeper and deeper into the desolate Atacama desert - the driest on the planet. In the end, this world of strange and solitary characters threatens to absorb the lives of the travelers, for whom the voyage becomes an adventure without return and in which from the beginning, fantasy has overtaken reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174183</url></doc>
