<plot>Raja (Mahesh Babu) is a small-time outlaw, whose daring antics land him the accidental job of designated bodyguard to Bhuvana (Lisa Ray). Bhuvana is being chased by an gang led by Shaka (Rahul Dey), who are after a map leading to a hidden diamond mine. Nicely shot, otherwise standard action fare - and interesting experience for anyone who's never heard that India once had a wild wild west. More likely though that fans of Bipasha Basu and Lisa Ray will be thrilled at this film, where they more than fulfill their roles as showpieces.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529606</url></doc>
