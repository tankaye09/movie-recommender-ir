They run a terrorist organization, inflicting casualties amongst troops and civilians alike in their cause. Their only major obstacle is D.I.G. of Police, Ajay Thakur, who has been responsible for apprehending and killing several of Habibullah's men. Ajay has a journalist sister, Pooja, who befriends a young man named Rohit, and both fall in love with each other. Quite unknown to Pooja, Rohit has links to Habibullah's gang and has instructions to abduct her at any cost, which he does. Now Habibullah has his heavily armed men, along with the hostages, barricade themselves in a Mosque, and it is here that the fate of many hostages, terrorists, Indian police personnel and troops will be decided.
