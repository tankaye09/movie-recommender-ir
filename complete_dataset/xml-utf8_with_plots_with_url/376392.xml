<plot>First comes the Chief's sleigh with old-fashioned side runners, containing the Chief and his driver. Next comes a chemical engine mounted on a stout double runner sled, which is followed closely by hose carriage apparatus mounted also on double runner sleds. Next comes a water tower mounted on a set of double runners and drawn by four beautiful horses. This is followed very closely by an engine drawn by a four-horse string team. This is followed by another engine on double runners, drawn by a four-horse tandem team. A second hose carriage and a Protective Insurance outfit brings up the rear. The breath leaves the horses' nostrils in great white puffs as they gallop through the snow-covered streets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376392</url></doc>
