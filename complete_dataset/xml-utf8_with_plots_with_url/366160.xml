<plot>Priya R. Singh lives in a palatial house with her businessman dad, Raghunath, and housewife mom, Savitri. She attends college, meets with fellow collegian, Vijay Verma, and after a few clashes, both fall madly in love with each other. When Raghunath finds out, he is enraged, as he would like Priya to marry Vikram Singh, the U.S. settled son of his friend, Ajit Singh, all the more when Vijay lives in a hostel room and has no family roots. Priya refuses to obey her father's wishes, elopes with Vijay, and with the help of College Principal Sinha, both decide to get married in a simple temple ceremony. The wedding is interrupted by Raghunath who alleges that Priya is not yet 18, is still a minor under his care. As a result, this marriage is canceled, and Priya is taken home. Priya knows that she will complete 18 years of age in 15 days, what she does not know is that her dad plans to take her to the U.S. and forcibly get her married to Vikram, and there is no power on earth that will dare to stop him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366160</url></doc>
