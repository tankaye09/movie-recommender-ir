<plot>Blessing House is a story of renewal. A childless, elderly couple must move from their beloved house. It is a charming old house whose creaks and ticks the old couple enjoys as if it were a living being. The infirmities of age and disease have made the house a danger to the wife. In order to protect her, they have sold their house. The wife fears that her husband is in denial of this great loss. She draws him out by placing a beloved vase into a yard sale, a cheap vase that he won for her at a carnival years ago, and that is ripe with meaning. In a final confrontation, she admits that she cannot bear to leave the house and prefers to commit suicide. The husband lets slip the beloved vase and it bursts on the ground at their feet. They dance slowly over the broken glass in a loving embrace prepared to face the future together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074550</url></doc>
