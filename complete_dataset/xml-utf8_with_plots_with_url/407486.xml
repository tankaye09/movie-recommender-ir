<plot>David Binford is reluctant to accept a calling in the new Home Teaching program, and rationalizes that he can turn it down since it was extended by his Elder's Quorum president instead of his bishop. His reluctance stems from the challenge of visiting a family with an inactive father, John Lannon, and children that emulate him. David's wife, Mary, and the bishop convince him to reconsider, and when he and his companion Marty arrive at the Lannon home, John hides his beer just in time. David and Marty discover the family's interests, and even John takes to considering them as friends. The youngest son, Jocko, is passionate about history, and he ceases to be a terror in Mary's Primary class after David convinces him that The Bible is great history. When Jocko is badly injured in a sledding accident, John calls David to have him administer to him in the hospital saying that he must rely on David's faith as an active church member. Later, John emotionally tells David that he wishes to become like him (an active Mormon father), and then David calls hearing John speak his heart the most rewarding experience of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407486</url></doc>
