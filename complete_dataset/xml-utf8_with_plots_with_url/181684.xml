<plot>My first documentary film studies the teenage world through the eyes of four teenagers and, at the same time, it maintains an open dialog with teachers, parents, friends and experts. The film was made in 2004 in two Spanish high schools of two quite different regions of the country. We interviewed in depth more than 40 students and finally we selected 4 of them based on their diversity, characters, ideas, academic level and social origin. Ioseba, Leire, Pura and Yolanda are the main characters of the film. At the same time in the film there are several people that will help the public to understand the teenage universe. Questions analyzed by these people include the influence of TV on teenagers, the sources of their motivation, the limitations of the Spanish educational system, the need for a betterment of the curriculum, among others. Throughout the film, a key concept implicitly arises. Teenagers, as human beings, have a superior nature that must receive attention.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?181684</url></doc>
