<plot>Raju and Mahalaxmi meet at a marriage ceremony and both are attracted to each other. They soon fall deeply in love with each other, and decide to inform their respective parents of their plan to get married. Raju's family welcomes Mahalaxmi, and approve of her. Just shortly after their approval, Mahalaxmi's parents interrupt the proceedings and forcibly take Mahalaxmi with them, to get married to someone. The reason for this hatred is that Raju's and Mahalaxmi's respective parents hate each other, and no amount of mediation, or even the suggestion of such, will ever mend fences, leaving Mahalaxmi and Raju to an unknown fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?397348</url></doc>
