<plot>Scene II of the Buster Brown Series. Shows a millinery store in the shopping district, and Mrs. Brown with a lady friend, admiring the hats displayed in the window. Buster and Tige are standing in the foreground. A howling swell, leading a small dog bedecked with ribbons, recognizes Mrs. Brown and stops to chat. Buster becomes impatient, tugs at his mamma's dress, and endeavors to hurry her; but the dude waves him aside. Buster gets angry at this and retaliates by setting Tige on the dude's dog. Tige secures a good hold on the dog's neck and hauls it all over the street. During the battle the dude makes frantic efforts to rescue his dog by kicking Tige. Mrs. Brown comes to the rescue by beating the dude over his head with her umbrella and knocking his hat off. Tige sees the hat, releases his hold, and the two dogs tear the hat into ribbons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087681</url></doc>
