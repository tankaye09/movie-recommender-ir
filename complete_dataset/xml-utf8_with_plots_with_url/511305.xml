<plot>This "Pete Smith Speciality" is one of a series of the type he did several times testing the audience on their knowledge of sports by asking several questions. The questions, with answers supplied, would be shown again. Often with Smith in a I-can't-believe-you-didn't know-that tone. The M-G-M production number on this one is S-754, with the "S' standing for Smith, as it does in the next Smith release,"Gettin' Glamour" carrying S-755 as the number.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511305</url></doc>
