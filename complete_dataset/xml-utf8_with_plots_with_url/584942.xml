<plot>Filmmaker, James Rosenberg, has finally had it. After months of lies and deceit from 'Film Land Entertainment' about his latest script; he decides to take matters into his own hands and take a stand for his career. The motley crew he encounters; Katya, a middle aged cleaning lady; Bill, a stoner bike messenger; Dan, a two-faced Producer; Pam, an over-caffeinated VP and Wendy, a receptionist with secret acting talent; both help and hinder his strategies towards getting his film made. The result is gunshot wounds, fireworks and a little romance. Lisa Milinazzo's, "The Query", presents a classic underdog tale with heart, humor and love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584942</url></doc>
