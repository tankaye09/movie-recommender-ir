<plot>Shows the rear entrance of a prosperous looking hotel in the background. An offensive looking ash barrel obstructs the sidewalk and a Dutch cook is seated in the window smoking his pipe. A happy looking Irish policeman appears upon the scene, and remonstrates with the cook for leaving the barrel upon the sidewalk. The cook only laughs at him. The policeman removes the barrel and goes on patroling his beat. The cook goes out, places the barrel on the sidewalk again, and a ferocious looking bulldog under it. The cop returns, grabs the barrel and in a fit of anger throws it over an adjacent stone wall, when he is immediately tackled by the bulldog, who simply wrecks his brand new uniform.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248379</url></doc>
