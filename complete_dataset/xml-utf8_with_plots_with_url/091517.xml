<plot>Taken recently showing the Forepaugh-Sells Circus parade and animals in the tents. Another pretty and interesting picture is this in which the "Ships of the Desert" are seen eating. Camels are pretty because of their ugliness, and attract as much attention as do other animals, not alone because they act differently, but for the reason that they are beasts of burden and bring home to us the stories we have read of the Desert.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091517</url></doc>
