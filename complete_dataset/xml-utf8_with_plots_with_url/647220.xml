<plot>In the summer of 2008, director Sean Fine, executive producer Susan MacLaury, and the original "War Dance" film crew traveled back to Uganda for the first time since "War Dance" was filmed. Finally, the people of Uganda, were able to watch "War Dance," the film dedicated to sharing their story with the world. Approximately 7-10 thousand of people came to see the film in the Patongo camp making a lasting impression on the entire crew as well as Rose, Nancy, and Dominic. Rose, Nancy, and Dominic have blossomed into strong and determined young adults who have become leaders in their community. They are admired for their strength and courage, and their hope shines brighter than ever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647220</url></doc>
