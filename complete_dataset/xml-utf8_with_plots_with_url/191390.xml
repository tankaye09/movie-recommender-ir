<plot>Al Wright has a Los Angeles nightmare commute on his way to work, culminating in a near head-on collision with a car entering an off-ramp. When Al discovers he has been assigned to an ad campaign for the driving school that nearly killed him, he takes a moralistic stand against excepting the ad campaign and is promptly fired. Driven by a combination of outrage and alcohol, Al starts his own counter-culture driving school with his good buddy Demo Dan, which quickly gets out of control and becomes the target of a corrupt insurance commissioner who will stop at nothing to destroy them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191390</url></doc>
