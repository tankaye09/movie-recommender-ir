<plot>When a band survives for 15 years, the odds they've overcome are amazing. If the music they create is never embraced by mainstream audiences, the odds are stacked against them even higher; yet Sick of it All have managed to maintain a loyal following around the world, appealing to new generations of fans every year. 'The Story So Far' documents Sick of it All's career from their meager beginnings to the unexpected success that has allowed them a globe-trotting career in music. Through personal insight and octane performances, the members and those closest to them describe their transformation from adolescent malcontents to the flag-bearers of an entire genre.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496008</url></doc>
