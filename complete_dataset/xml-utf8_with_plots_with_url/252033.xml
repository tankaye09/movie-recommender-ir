<plot>This is the untold story of the Lemko people of the Carpathian Mountains. Detailing the history of one of Europe's most unique cultures, the film first asks the question, "What is a Lemko?". From here, the film takes us through the harrowing journey of the oppression and persecutions the people went through during the first half of the 20th century. The story of Tollerhoff, which saw the Lemkos put into concentration camps by the Austrian government during World War I is told by historian Paul Best. The covered up and shameful attempted genocide of the Lemkos (Action Vistula) by the Stalinist Polish government after World War II is recounted by the survivors of the event itself. Finally, the film focuses on the modern Lemkos, and the reawakening the people have experienced in the second half of the 20th century. The film takes its title from a direct quote by Andy Warhol, when asked where he was from. His reply: "I am from nowhere." Warhol himself was the son of Lemko immigrants.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252033</url></doc>
