<plot>An exciting foot race, between seven naked young bucks of the Navajo tribe. These men are trained runners and are able to exhibit the most wonderful powers of endurance. With nothing but their breech-clouts to impede their movements, they cover the ground at a most surprising rate of speed. The race is across a desert plain, studded with sage-brush.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391441</url></doc>
