<plot>A very competitive new breed of undercover detectives that handle what they call justice in a unethical way. It's all tied to a "Game of Chess". Every move is calculated with precision one mistake can cost your life. Unfortunately for the criminals they are unaware of their involvement in this demented game. Of course the detectives cover up their tracks making sure not to get caught and keep a little extra for themselves. The chess game is located at "the usual spot" a local pub near the precinct where majority law enforcements hang out. This is a riveting, on the edge, dark film that shows the difference between "the good side" and "the bad side" of the law all by one twisted game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209213</url></doc>
