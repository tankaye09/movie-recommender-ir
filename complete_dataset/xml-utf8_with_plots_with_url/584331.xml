<plot>A grand and superb series of pictures of the greatest artistic value, which has been arranged with the utmost reverence for accuracy. The costumes, scenes and details of this film are as near perfect as is possible to obtain from the story of the bible. Starting with the division of the father's wealth amongst the sons the scene is quickly followed by one which shows one of the sons spending his money in riotous living. The next scene shows the son pushing and struggling with the swine for a portion of the husks which has been thrown to them. Then the prodigal's return home, his meeting of his mother and father, the forgiveness which is followed by the gorgeous banquet and the feast of the fatted calf. This film is highly commended for Sunday school lectures church meetings and similar purposes. Calculated to impress and gratify everyone; while from the admirable taste and tact with which the subject has been treated it cannot possibly cause offense. This film is the fines!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584331</url></doc>
