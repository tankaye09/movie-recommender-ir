<plot>You are moving along platforms avoiding Grid Bugs, Tanks, and Recognizers. You must collect floating bits at each level of the screen. After you collect all the floating bits, the I/O beam in the center glows and you can enter it to move on to the next screen. On the third level;, there is a Solar Sailer that you can ride to get over enemies. You can go down at any time but to move up, you must cross the I/O beam to activate the elevators. Once you have used the elevators to move up a level, you must go through the I/O beam again to re-activate the elevators again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024298</url></doc>
