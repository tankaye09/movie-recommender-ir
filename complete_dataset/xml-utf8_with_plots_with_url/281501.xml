<plot>United States, 1964. Bobbie Dean is a boyish girl who has an extraordinary talent for basketball. Because she's a girl, Bobbie is limited in her playing. She can only compete in girl's basketball, that has restricted rules and is hardly taken serious by anyone. When Bobbie is helping her father making a delivery, some boys are playing ball. They assume she is a boy and when they see her play they want her on their college team. But when Bobbie's secret eventually gets out, there are people who are willing to use any means necessary to ensure she never touches a ball in man's basketball again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281501</url></doc>
