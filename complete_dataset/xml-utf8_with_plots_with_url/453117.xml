<plot>Seven year old Rachel wakes up one morning and finds an ad for the new 'Sassy Holly' doll. Rachel checks her piggy bank, but she is one dollar short of the price for the doll. Determined to get this doll, Rachel goes to extreme limits by stealing money from her mother's purse. Unfortunately for Rachel, no matter how much money she steals, she never has quite enough. In the midst of trying to gather up enough money for this doll an old man arrives at Rachel's door collecting money for her friend's family whose house burned down. Rachel realizes that her friend's family needs the money more than she does, and she decides to give the money she's been saving to the Old Man. Rachel returns the stolen money to her mom's purse, and through this generous act of giving Rachel receives her true fortune.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453117</url></doc>
