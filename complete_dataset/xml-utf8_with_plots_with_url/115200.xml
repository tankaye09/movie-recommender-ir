<plot>Cooper is a 21 year old college student who still lives at home with his parents. He is stuck in a day job he can't stand and in a life he can't figure out. One weekend night, while his folks are out of town, Max, Cooper's best friend, rudely interrupts his night sleep by inviting himself over after a recent college party bust on campus. While hesitant at first, Coop's college mood quickly changes after finding out that Max has invited Kate and Liz, Coop's dream girl, over as well. A night that began uneventful soon turns out to be a night that will never be forgotten.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115200</url></doc>
