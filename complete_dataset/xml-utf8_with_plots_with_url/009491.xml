<plot>Join Jason Hervey of "The Wonder Years" and Officer Pete Salzberg for a day of fun, excitement, and learning. Together, parents and kids will learn about helmet safety, gun safety, and how to use the police emergency number 911. Through the effective use of re-enactments, everyone will learn about "Stranger Danger" and the "Buddy System." Plus you'll get to meet all of the Walpole cops for kids including Officer Richie on motorcycle, Trooper Bennett of the Massachusettes State Police in the helicopter, and special Officer Harco; he's a K-9 who sniffs out the bad guys. See up close all of the equipment police officers use while on duty and check this out, you'll get to go airborne for a spectacular ride in a police helicopter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009491</url></doc>
