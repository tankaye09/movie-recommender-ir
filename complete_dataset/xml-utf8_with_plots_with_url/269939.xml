<plot>The village Squire with designs on a village maiden has her suitor falsely imprisoned. " Charles Reade who wrote this book in 1856 so exposed the prevailing conditions in English prisons that he is generally credited with being responsible for the present reforms. Queen Victoria after reading this work, demanded to know if such brutalities were being performed in her name and ordered an investigation which brought about the universally high standard prevailing today."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269939</url></doc>
