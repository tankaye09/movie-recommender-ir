<plot>The scene is laid in a hotel corridor. The doors are leading into two adjoining rooms. The bellboy ushers a travelling man into one of the rooms. The travelling man comes out and returns promptly, but this time he goes into the wrong room. He enters by mistake a room which is occupied by an old maid, and she indignantly drives him out and beats him over the head with her umbrella. Just as the commercial traveller comes headlong out of the room, he bumps into a couple that are walking along the hall and a lively mix-up ensues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602598</url></doc>
