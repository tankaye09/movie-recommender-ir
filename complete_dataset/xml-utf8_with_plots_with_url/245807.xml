<plot>"HORROR TALK" (1989) was the very first documentary/talk-show to tackle the subject of Ed Wood and his awful 1950's horror movies. Producer/host Jay Jennings and co-host David Del Valle welcome their special guest Paul Marco aka "Kelton The Cop", as he discusses his film career, as well as, his friendship with Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi. Marco also supplied rare film clips, which up until that time, were not widely seen by the general public.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245807</url></doc>
