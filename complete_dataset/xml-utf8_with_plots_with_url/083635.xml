<plot>Jack's father is sending Jack away to keep him from the gambling, booze, girls and late nights. He has Ossie go as Jack's companion, not knowing that Ossie does the same things as Jack. They decide to go to California and the trip is long as Jack stops for every girl he sees. In a restaurant in the southwest, they meet Poncho. It seems that every time Ossie sees Pancho, he does something that almost gets him into a fight. When they get to Pasadena, the boys meet Connie and Penny and Aunt Polly. After a few days, Jack proposes and Connie accepts. However, that is that day that Mabel, Jacks jilted fianc√©e from New York, shows up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083635</url></doc>
