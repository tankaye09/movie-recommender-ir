<plot>John Cedar's wife loves him and his brother has always had his best interest at heart. But when an incident at work causes John to snap, he can't trust anyone or anything, even himself. Imagine struggling with reality alone. Now, imagine finding out your wife is having an affair with your brother. Is it real? Can you tell the difference? John Cedar morphs brutality and mental instability while struggling for his own life. After killing himself and his own son, he takes his rage out on his wife and brother. Or so he thinks... All he can do is follow his own bloody corpse forcing him to face a sadistic reality. Through instinct he resorts to his professional detective skills to try and sort out what is happening. Without succinct chronology Ruined opens doors that don't exist, or do they?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470203</url></doc>
