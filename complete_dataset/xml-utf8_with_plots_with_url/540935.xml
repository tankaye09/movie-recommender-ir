<plot>They think fast. They respond even faster. Their energy and inspiration come from the charge of the audience and the thrill of performing live and unrehearsed. The Art of the Moment is a documentary film about three professional New York improvisers. John, the comedian, Enos, the pianist and Linda, the dancer are skilled artists who exhibit an uncanny talent for creating on the fly. They pursue the perfect moment...on stage and in life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540935</url></doc>
