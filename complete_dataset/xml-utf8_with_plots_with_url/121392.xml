<plot>Cumberland Island has been a haven for pirates, prisoners and Presidents. It was home to Nathaniel Greene and the wealthy Carneigie family. It has endured raging storms, developers, and a Kennedy wedding. Today it is home to wild horses, armadillos, loggerhead turtles and a few hardy individuals. Go back in time and experience the rich history of this unique and wild place -- from the island's beginnings to its establishment as a National Seashore. The film features rare, never-before-seen family home movies and photographs. It also includes footage shot over a four-year period that shows Cumberland in its wild and untamed splendor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121392</url></doc>
