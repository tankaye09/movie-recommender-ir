<plot>A despondent man (Mike Russo), about to commit suicide at a train station, is confronted by an attractive young woman. She consoles the man, telling him about the beauty of nature, love and life. He decides to go on living. As he is about to leave, he notices a despondent girl wobbling like a drunk on the stairs. When he goes to her aid, he is shocked to find it's the same woman who talked him away from the notion of suicide. However, she has no idea what he's talking about and has never seen him before. He consoles her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046143</url></doc>
