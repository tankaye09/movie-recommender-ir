<plot>Tai and Choi are both fans of the internet, but they use it for different purposes. Tai uses it to chase women, while Choi uses it as to escape from reality, isolating himself from all those around him. While Tai is chasing after several girls, he meets Siu Yu. At the same time, Choi meets a girl named "Lightning Dancing Queen". As Choi's virtual world becomes more passionate, self-confident, and humorous, his life in the real world becomes more and more remote.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144183</url></doc>
