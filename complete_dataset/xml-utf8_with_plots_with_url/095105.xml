<plot>The year is 1940. Hitler has invaded Poland causing both France and Great Britain to declare war on Germany. Fearing an imminent attack by the German Luftwaffe, Londoners are told to start the evacuation of children to safer areas outside the city. Many are sent to rural provinces, but a few are sent by ship to Canada and America... As the German Luftwaffe drop bombs over the city of London, Caroline Price struggles to accept her new home in America and her new family, the Johnsons. Caroline patiently waits for a letter from her Mother, informing her that she may return to London, but as the days go by and as the war abroad rages on without any sign from her parents, she begins to fear the worst. "Caroline Crossing" is an intimate portrayal of a young girl, torn from the only home she ever knew, who must find a way to survive against the backdrop of a world at war.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095105</url></doc>
