<plot>Izzard sets out to discover just how English the English are. Even though the last successful military take-over was 1066 he looks at the waves of immigration and influences that have made England a melting pot. He reminds everyone that the Royal Family have only been "Windsor" since 1917 when they adopted the new name. Bad enough to be fighting your cousin the Kaiser, but to be fighting the place that gave you your name (Saxe-Coburg-Gotha) was absolutely intolerable old chap!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375597</url></doc>
