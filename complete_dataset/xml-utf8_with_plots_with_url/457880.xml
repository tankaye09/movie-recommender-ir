<plot>As part of last year's Temps d'Images festival we produced a 'bildtheatre' performance titled RECYCLEd, experimenting with the relationship between theatre and film, playing around with the analogies of recycling, in this case meant any cyclically repeated notion. The dramaturgy of the production was provided by a theme according to which our far-fetched ideas were replaced and thus became open to further use, i.e. a symbiosis formed between them when they were recycled. These fictional etudes were short 'sensations' based on dialogues, represented by strange characters, in some shifted space and time and in surreal settings, teeming with visual allegories and codes."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457880</url></doc>
