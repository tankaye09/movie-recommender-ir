<plot>In which a man is seen trying to get a good night's rest, but is annoyed by insects, some of which are seen trying to crawl up the wall. He rises and each one he hits with his boot explodes, fire and smoke issuing therefrom. An excellent subject, funny in the extreme.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012519</url></doc>
