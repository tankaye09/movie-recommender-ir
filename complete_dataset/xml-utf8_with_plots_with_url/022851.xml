<plot>In 4-minutes, 30 -seconds, we get a colorful glimpse at a cute organ-player who won't take no for an answer. She's living in the moment, and she's going to play her Farfisa, no matter what. Nothing is going to stop her, not an empty house, or a technicality. She's home, she's got a Vespa, and she's an Action Woman. With music by 60's bands, ? &amp; The Mysterians and The Fox, this film is about starting over, personal freedom, and proof that you are what you do.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022851</url></doc>
