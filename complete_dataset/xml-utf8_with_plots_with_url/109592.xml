<plot>This is an astonishing picture of a sport which is almost wholly unknown in America. At the foot of a precipitous slide in the Alps has been built a curved bank of ice something after the fashion of the incline of a small bicycle track. The sleds go down the slide at high speed and as they strike the curve go around the edge frequently upsetting and hurling the rider into the air. The second part of the picture shows a still more dangerous feat of coasting on sleds to an overhang from which the sleds fly into space and land more often than not on top of the coaster than under him. A thrilling scene of fine photographic value.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109592</url></doc>
