<plot>Lucy has problems. The love of her life is marrying her best friend and the bridesmaid's dress she's supposed to wear is two sizes too small. When the bus she's on breaks down in the middle of nowhere, her fellow passengers - a retired B-movie actress turned Las Vegas magician, and an ex-march of dimes posterchild - conspire to teach her about beauty, love, and when to take your clothes off and tango in the rain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465133</url></doc>
