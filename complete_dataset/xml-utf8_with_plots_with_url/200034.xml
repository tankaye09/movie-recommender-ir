<plot>A short drama about the game of pool and how it brings a father and son together, where they both learn to play for the love of the game and not the money. The main characters in the film are the father and son. In the beginning of the story they seem to be very distant and there is a sense of loss in their relationship. After arguments and frustration with raising a son into manhood, it took the father to realize what this game of pool meant to both of them. He realizes what his son really misses, him being around and the moments they shared on the pool table. In the climax the father finds his son hustling on the pool tables and he helps his son win his money back. After the father wins a lot of money, he gives it back to the looser, to prove to his son with his actions that pool playing is not about money and if you love playing it should be for the passion you have for the game. The love for the game of pool is what was missing in their relationship, where pool was a bond they shared as father and son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200034</url></doc>
