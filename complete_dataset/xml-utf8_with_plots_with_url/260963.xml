<plot>Three "Imps", Erk, Netl &amp; Vex, circle the earth in their makeshift asteroid charged with the exclusive (and thankless) duty of granting wishes to those who make them. Mired by their dead-end existence, they perpetually yearn for a promotion from their employer, the ultra-suave Bigguy N. DeSkye, CEO of The Universe Inc. When DeSkye announces an opening available in Man in the Moon Productions,(contingent upon the success of their next job) mayhem seems to rain down around the IMPs as they attempt a bungle-free mission delivering precipitation to a dust-bowl farmer and his henpecking wife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260963</url></doc>
