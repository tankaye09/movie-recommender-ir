<plot>The Fantasai Comet passes the night sky once every six years, and with it, local legend says, certain mythological beasts stir from their hiding. Sure enough, misfortune strikes the small town of Prospect, Oregon when a local stargazing adventurer mysteriously disappears while backpacking in the wilderness on a quest to see the comet. Joseph, his only son, is suddenly left without a family or a clue to the fate of his father. Six years later, following the return of the mystifying comet, Jo finds himself once again in the midst of tragedy. A series of violent attacks and mysterious markings leaves little doubt that the mythological beast is back, forcing Jo to relive the grief of his past. Though he tries to warn the community, his words fall on deaf ears. Jo has no choice but to take matters into his own hands, not only to save the people of Prospect, but also gain closure to the mystery surrounding his father's disappearance. Armed with little more than his obsessive drive for answers, Jo journeys deep into the world of the unknown. Constantly battling his darkest fears and most heartfelt questions of faith, Jo comes closer than ever to his father and the horrifying truth...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?489754</url></doc>
