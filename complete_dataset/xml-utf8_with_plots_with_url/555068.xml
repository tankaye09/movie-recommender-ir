<plot>Based on a true story. Hollywood's top gun limo driver Vincent Viassio fantasizes of being an Indy 500 race car driver as he vicariously roars along the streets of Los Angeles. All the while Vincent is being hunted down by two repo men trying to take back his beloved high powered Audi W12, his only solace in the midst is an imaginary love affair he has with a waitress Kasie Monroe. Upon the news of his mother's death Vincent is hurled into an onslaught of hallucinations &amp; perilous situations. Vincent is drawn in deeper to examine his past when he meets up with parapeligic client Bradley Goldman for a two day road trip to Las Vegas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555068</url></doc>
