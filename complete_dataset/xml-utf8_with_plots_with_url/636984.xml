<plot>While hiding from their vengeful cousins, the Kauravas, the Pandava brothers, Yudhister, Arjun, Bhim, Nakul, and Sahdev enter a forest, and this is where Bhim slays a demon. In order to make amends to the demon's mother, he agrees to marry her daughter, Hidamba, and they subsequently return home. Hidamba gets pregnant and gives birth to a baby boy who she names Ghatotkach, who grows up to be a mighty illusionist, who can fly, became a giant at will, and shape-shift. One day Ghatotkach gets into a confrontation, albeit unknowingly, with Abhimanyu, the son of Arjun, who is on his way to abduct Surekha, the daughter of Balram, who is being married against her will to Lakshman, the semi-senile son of Duryodhan, and ends up killing him. When he finds out that Abhimanyu is his cousin, he brings him back to life with Amrit (Holy Nectar), and decides to join him in his quest. The duo do get away with irritating the Kauravas almost resulting in a battle between the Yadavs and them, but Bhagwan Shri Kishan decides to intervene and placates both parties. The question does remain with Kishanji himself getting involved will the duo succeed in abducting Surekha?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?636984</url></doc>
