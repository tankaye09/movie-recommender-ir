<plot>Gail, a university student, arrives at the fish archives of the museum of natural history; she has bones from a dig on Catalina, and her assignment is to determine which fish the prehistoric islanders ate. She's all business, dressed in black; the two scientists at the archive joke around, make references to "Office Space," and try to get her to lighten up. No dice. She matches all but one set of bones, and finally needs their help. The three go on a hunt through the museum's many shelves of samples. Will they sort it out, and will she have any fun?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196233</url></doc>
