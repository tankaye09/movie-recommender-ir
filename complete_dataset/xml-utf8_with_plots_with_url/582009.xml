<plot>When Shintech, the U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese corporate giant, announced plans to build a $700 million polyvinyl chloride plant in Convent, Louisiana, the citizens organized and said "no". People from different backgrounds and ethnicities joined together in the common fight to stop what was becoming a state-wide pattern of environmental racism. This film chronicles their struggle and victory which forced Shintech to build the plant in another community in the state.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582009</url></doc>
