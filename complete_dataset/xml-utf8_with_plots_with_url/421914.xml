<plot>After the train arrives the Circus employees prepare to unload the animals. This picture shows them in the act of unloading their horses, and affords the onlooker a better view of the famous trick horses than they would get were they to attend the Circus performance. Large planks are thrown up to the door of the car, and the animals are led down and out until they disappear from view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421914</url></doc>
