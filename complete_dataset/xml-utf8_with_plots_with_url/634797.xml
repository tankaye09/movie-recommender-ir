<plot>Shiva and Deva (Ajith) are twins who are heirs to a massive industrial empire. Deva the older, more responsible brother, is a brilliant industrialist, but also deaf mute. Shiva woos Priya (Simran) by inventing a tragic love story. She falls for him, they get married. Priya, coincidentally, was also the girl Deva was interested in, but never got around to expressing his liking to. The new bride finds an inconvenient tension once she moves in with the two brothers. The title reflects the tale from the Ramayana epic, in which Vaali, the elder twin of Sugreeva, fell in love with his younger brother's wife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?634797</url></doc>
