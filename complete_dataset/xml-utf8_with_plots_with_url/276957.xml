<plot>This video features highlights of some of the matches from the Third Annual Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup tag team tournament. The tournament took place from April 22-April 23, 1988. Most of the matches of this large tournament are left out, and a lot of the matches are edited pretty short to fit on a two hour tape. Teams included on the tape are The Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal), The Midnight Express (Eaton and Lane), The Four Horsemen (Anderson and Blanchard), The Fantastics (Rogers and Fulton), Lex Luger and Sting, The Jive Tones (Whatley and Conway), Ivan Koloff and Dick Murdoch, Larry Zbyszko and Al Perez, The Varsity Club (Rotunda and Steiner), The Powers of Pain (Warlord and Barbarian), Jimmy Valiant and Mighty Wilbur, The Sheepherders (Miller and Williams), Kendall Windham and The Italian Stallion, and Ron Simmons and Steve Williams. I won't tell the matches as that will give away the winners (since this was a single elimination tournament). Other matches on the card are NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair vs Nikita Koloff, The Midnight Rider (Dusty Rhodes) vs J.J. Dillon in a bloody Texas Bullrope Match, and Jimmy Garvin vs Kevin Sullivan in a Prince of Darkness Death Match (both wrestlers had hoods over their heads and couldn't see). Finally, the tape goes back to January 24, 1988 for the finals of the Third Annual Bunkhouse Stampede. Battle royales had been held at several house shows in the weeks leading up to this event, and the winners of each battle royale entered this battle royale final, held inside a steel cage. The match is joined in progress on the tape, so I don't know if some wrestlers had already been eliminated. The wrestlers on the tape are Arn Anderson, Road Warrior Animal, The Barbarian, Tully Blanchard, Ivan Koloff, Lex Luger, The Warlord, and the winner of the first two Bunkhouse Stampedes, Dusty Rhodes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276957</url></doc>
