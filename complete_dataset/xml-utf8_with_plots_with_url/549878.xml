<plot>_Confession, The (1990)_ (qv) survives in _Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992)_ (qv) in its original camera negative. It remained unfinished due to the death of 'Sergei Parajanov' (qv). _Confession, The (1990)_ (qv) was his favorite screenplay, which was written in the 1960s and was his film-memory of the childhood, student years, marriage, imprisonment and more as the fantasist Parajanov perceived it. Parajanov gifted the screenplay to 'Mikhail Vartanov' (qv), made a drawing on the cover and wrote: "The Confession will only be made by a director born in 1924 in Tiflis, Georgia." He predicted that he would not finish it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549878</url></doc>
