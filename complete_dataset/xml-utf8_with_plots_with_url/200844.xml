<plot>This documentary weaves images of hope with the desperate reality of serving a life sentence in prison. Shot entirely at Western Wayne Correctional facility (the former DeHoCo, Detroit House of Corrections in Plymouth, MI) and three years in the making, Forgotten Voices chronicles the struggle of three prisoners and the impact of art in their rehabilitation. Featuring the ArtsGrowth prison outreach program, this film captures the raw intensity of individuals dealing with their violent pasts through creative writing and painting. In true cinema verite" style with no narrator, prisoners and correctional staff speak candidly and openly about the merits of arts education in state prisons, and the need for alternative programs, as both the cost and number of prisoners escalate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200844</url></doc>
