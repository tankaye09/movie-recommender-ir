<plot>Taken on the Southern Pacific R. R., just outside of Beaumont, Texas. The picture begins when the train is at a distance of over a mile. Fine smoke effects are introduced as the train thunders down the track. The train comes straight at the audience, and it seems as if it would run right into the front row of seats, until it strikes a curve, changes it direction, and passes on at a high rate of speed, giving a side view of the engine and cars. A very fine picture of the finest train between Chicago and California.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394246</url></doc>
