<plot>Two children place a pan of flour on a shelf in the kitchen, with the intention of having it fall on the policeman when he calls to visit the cook. The cook, however, discovers the string and cuts it. Her friend the cop calls as usual. The call is interrupted by the arrival of the Captain, who is on a tour of inspection. The cook hides the policeman in the closet and arranges the string so that the Captain will get the flour as he enters. The Captain comes in and gets the contents of the flour pan, as was intended. While he is blinded by the flour that falls over him, the policeman escapes undiscovered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017485</url></doc>
