<plot>Evil rules the night. It spreads its black hand across the land. No one is safe from its wrath and sooner or later it will devour everyone. One man has made it his purpose to journey into the heart of hell and face the devil himself to take back what is rightfully his. This is the story of Jonathan Harker. This Orlando based team have challenged themselves to create a silent film in HARKER, a puppet short. They have gone to great lengths to re-create the true feeling of a silent movie. Puppets are created with an exceptional visual style, much like the German Expressionists films The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230547</url></doc>
