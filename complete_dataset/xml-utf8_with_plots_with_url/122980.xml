<plot>BBC correspondent 'Charles Wheeler (II)' (qv), himself a veteran of the D-Day landings, visits the area and talks to other people involved in D-Day. Particularly to Maj 'John Howard (XXXIII)' (qv) and others of the Ox &amp; Bucks Light Infantry who landed by glider and took the Pegasus Bridge near Caen. Also to Lt Col 'T.B.H. Otway' (qv) and members of 9th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, who parachuted in and disabled the Merville Battery which overlooked the invasion beaches. Wheeler also meets some of the Germans who tried to defend the region and to French and British civilians caught up in the action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?122980</url></doc>
