<plot>Indie producer Julia Stemock took her professional frustrations and disappointments and made lemonade, in the form of a newly released DVD/CDROM package entitled "The Basics of Filmmaking." The project is the fruit of an innovative 8-hour, 3-table gabfest between more than 36 industry professionals that was organized and staged by Stemock with the idea of passing along the kind of practical, real-world information that could save other aspiring filmmakers from costly mistakes, errors in judgment, or the fallout from ego-blindness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542156</url></doc>
