<plot>Taken on the Mt. Tamalpais R. R., known to every tourist throughout the entire world. The scenery which is encountered on this road, which takes the tourist from San Francisco to the top of Mt. Tamalpais, some 5,000 feet above the sea level, is most enchanting. The background is a panoramic view of the hills and valleys as the train ascends the mountain and winds around the curves. In portions of the film one seems to be running along at a very high rate of speed on the edge of the huge cliff, and the valley can be seen thousands of feet below. This makes the picture most thrilling as one experiences the sensation of momentarily expecting to be hurled into space. In other portions of the film, one gets a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate in the distance. The picture itself is composed of perfect photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422027</url></doc>
