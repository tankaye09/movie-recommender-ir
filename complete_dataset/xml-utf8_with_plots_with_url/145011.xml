<plot>Young Dick can't help kissing any maiden he meets. Some like this attention, others do not. He follows a particularly attractive girl (when seen from the back), but when she turns for his kiss, she proves repulsive. Eventually the girls' boyfriends tire of Dick, and chase him into the village pond: he can't escape, is caught, and tarred and feathered for his pains.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?145011</url></doc>
