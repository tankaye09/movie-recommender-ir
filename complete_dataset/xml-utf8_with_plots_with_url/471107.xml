<plot>Russ' Story - One Man, One Journey, Many Colours is a profound documentary that proposes that the energy and life of a person continues to live in the actions, memories and experiences of the community. From the unique viewpoint of Zoe Itzstein-Davey (Russ' daughter), the documentary explores the many gifts and physical horror of Cancer as experienced by Russ, his family, community and friends. Communicating the importance of the balance of the spiritual and the conventional, strength and vulnerability, fear and acceptance of the journey and interwoven with current day interviews, the experiences of Russ and his family, friends and community, reveal a potent, real life story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471107</url></doc>
