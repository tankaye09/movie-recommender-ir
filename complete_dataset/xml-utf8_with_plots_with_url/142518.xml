<plot>In the Andromeda galaxy, Treytos Prime has stood for centuries as the galaxy's most powerful world. Queen Adelea has ruled for the 10 years since her husband passed under mysterious circumstances. In that time she has transformed Treytos from an imperialist conqueror to a cooperative neighbor. A growing resentment for her rule has developed in the military led by General Quin. The future greatness of Treytos depends upon her two young daughters Adriana and Claudia. The Queen's oldest advisor is the mysterious old Witch. She shows Adelea a vision of her death at the hands of someone close to her, but it is not clear who that person is. The Queen must discover who is at the center of the plot to end her reign before it is too late.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?142518</url></doc>
