<plot>Jason wakes up in a bare room; the atmosphere is unreal. He's frightened, disorientated, he doesn't know who he is or where he is. He remembers nothing of his past. Morgana appears before him, an ethereal figure half way between a sorceress and a witch. She offers to help him. Morgana is blind but she proves she is endowed with a perception that goes beyond normal senses. She leads him through a series of emotional experiences that will drag him towards a terrible choice that he will not be able to make. Is this reality or imagination? Morgana's revelation arrives like a terrible sentence: the mind is man's greatest freedom but at the same time it is a prison from which he will never be able to flee. The senses of guilt quickly become unbearable and Jason will prove unable to accept them completely. This will lead him to the final choice that will leave Morgana speechless.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?367768</url></doc>
