<plot>What does it take to become a woman, to be a woman, to stay a woman? Difficult questions - not only women do know that. But help is at hand: Divas of the silver screen show us the way. Icons of the movies speak out on longings and fear, love and hate, and the search for female identity. They let us participate in their passion, their happiness and their tears, and their assertiveness. A movie without men? Almost without men. CELLULOIDIVA is the female pendant of A MAN'S GOT TO DO WHAT A MAN'S GOT TO DO</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097949</url></doc>
