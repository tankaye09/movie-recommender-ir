<plot>There are some movies that are so bad they're good. And there are some movies that are so bad- that they're just bad! Really bad! And there are people out there who love these horribly bad films, like us! Welcome to The Fifty Worst Films Of All Time. From armless kung-fu fighters, ear-eating midgets, and crawling hands to just about everything Ed Wood did. This is the finest collection of bad films ever compiled. The budgets are cheap, the acting is terrible, and the plots are nowhere to be seen. It's The Fifty Worst Films Of All Time!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?538491</url></doc>
