<plot>Ranjit is the right-hand man of a gangster named "Uncle". He has been working for him since he was a runaway child, and excels in all of kinds of criminal activities, currently managing a night-club called "Playboy". He meets with beautiful Anju and both fall in love with each other. Then he finds out that Anju is not who she claims to be but someone hired by Pratap to be close to him, entrap him, and get him killed. But that does not happen, Ranjit survives, rescued by Anju, and he helps her free her brother, Rakesh, from Pratap's clutches. Then some priceless jewelery is placed on display, and a number of gangsters decide to try and steal them, knowing fully well that there is a 24 hour police guard, as well as an alarm system. It is after this robbery that the past will be re-visited and it is then a number of people, on whom Ranjit has depended upon, will come to know of his real background, including the murder he committed before he started his career as a criminal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340003</url></doc>
