<plot>In the Year 2045, some of us will still be alive. Lamont A. Maxwell, an old Conservative Politician will make an extraordinary journey through the Alpha and the Omega of his life. From his legislation, he will change America's mind regarding reparations, but his youngest son, Jonathan, has another idea. In The Closet examines the life of a boy who grew up in the struggle of racism and hatred and the affects it had on him. In 1988, a young Lamont Maxwell watched three men and the local sheriff kill his parents. His innocence slowly becomes corrupted with sin and resentment as he becomes an adult. His struggles with his corruption become unbearable when he is called to be pastor of his church. Stuck in sin, Lamont leaves his wife, Florence, and two boys to pursue his political career and a romantic relationship with his office assistant. If elected Lt. Governor his life will change dramatically. His decision to turn his back on God and divorce his faithful wife leads to Florence's destruction. His two sons, Jonathan and Luke emerge from this twisted life corrupted with evil to govern the Black Foundation. The Black Foundation is a movement in the United States, which suggests that the Government apologize to slave descendants for their hardships, and bestow on them reparations, whether it be in the form of money, land, or other goods. In the year 2045, the Black Foundation is a new movement to secure reparations for African Americans. They demand a clear apology for the slavery from the former slave-trading countries and the United States of America. By any means necessary.. "..Or Holy Hell will break loose.." It isn't late before Luke, the oldest son, discovers the power and guidance of Christ and not only tries to save himself but his brother and father as well. We all know Christ will prevail, but will it be too late for the Maxwell Family??</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262889</url></doc>
