<plot>What does it take to truly appreciate your life? A Santa Barbara therapist brings together eight patients to collaborate with local professional artists in creating works of art that illuminate their cancer experiences. In the process, everyone involved learns unexpected lessons about living life to the fullest. The Aphrodite Project follows eight cancer patients/survivors as they are paired with professional artists to collaboratively create works of art and/or music that express their experiences with cancer. The film begins with the very first meeting of the participants to plan the project, and follows them through to a gallery opening of completed works. Through the experiences and art of the participants, the film captures the theme of living life to its fullest, and filling every day with joy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540507</url></doc>
