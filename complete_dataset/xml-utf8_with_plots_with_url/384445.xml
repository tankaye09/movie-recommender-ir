<plot>My Mini is a personal account of how and why the filmmaker decided to rebuild an old 1966 Morris Mini which was a total basket case. It documents the highs and lows of three years hard work and tells the story of what went into the project and how it ended up being more than just a car to him. The film was made as part of 'Straight 8', on one roll of Super 8 film, therefore all the editing was done in camera and the soundtrack and voiceover married up from memory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384445</url></doc>
