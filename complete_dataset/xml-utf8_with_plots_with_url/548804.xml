<plot>A profile of and salute to the cinematographer: his many responsibilities on the set, his background and apprenticeship, his tools, and his artistry. The cinematographer is responsible for how things in a movie will look: make up and costumes are done to anticipate his work. We look at his tools: cameras, lenses and filters, equipment for tracking shots, and lights. He's responsible for 1001 elements, a team of artisans, and, most important, how light will enhance a film's mood and characterizations. The short closes with a look at difficult shots: underwater, from the air, in storms, and from scaffolding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548804</url></doc>
