<plot>A man returns to a remote northern island of his childhood intent on committing suicide, but instead becomes involved in a paranormal murder. Gordon Heath (a 31 year old man) rides his motorcycle recklessly north on highway 69 to the Pointe au Baril Marina in Northern Georgian Bay. He is met by Okemos, a Native who takes him by boat to the Ojibway Club, located on a remote island thirty minutes from mainland. It's October and the club is closed, but Gordon has managed to rent a cabin next to the hotel. Besides Okemos, who is the property manager, the area is completely deserted until next season. Gordon's wife and daughter have just been killed, and unable to deal with the grief, he is determined to commit suicide at the place of his fondest childhood memories. But things don't go quite according to plan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356468</url></doc>
