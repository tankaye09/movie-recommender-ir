<plot>An honest clerk gets into business with a smuggler and commits an embezzlement to pay for his daughter's (Madunnella) wedding. The smuggler has, however, set his eyes on the girl and blackmails her father about the embezzled money. Madunnella succeeds in getting her father's money back even although she has to withstand a sexual assault. Furious with rage the clerk kills the smuggler and is sent to jail. He will be out, however, in time for his daughter wedding with her legitimate boy-friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351421</url></doc>
