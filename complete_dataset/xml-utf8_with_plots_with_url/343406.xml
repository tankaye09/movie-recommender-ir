But on the inside Clay has yet to accomplish what means the most to him, his father's dream of opening his own jazz club, Whispers; a dream never fulfilled and Clay takes full responsibility for this. But now that his father has passed away, leaving him a large inheritance, nothing is going to stand between him and his chance to redeem himself. When his wife Josalyn shows concern with how the money is spent Clay is left feeling alone in his endeavor, save his childhood friend and business partner Kirk Washington. But when a mutual friend introduces him to Realtor Priscilla Amour he finds they have much in common and her passion for his passion ignites a fire that Clay thinks he can control. But his attempt to get as close to the fire as he can without being burned fails when he learns things are not always the way they appear. With a suspenseful twist, Clay finds himself caught up in murder and deceit as the primary suspect in a homicide and now faces losing not only his father's dream once again but his own as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343406</url></doc>
