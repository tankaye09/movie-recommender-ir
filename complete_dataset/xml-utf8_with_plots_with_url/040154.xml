<plot>Released only a short time after the Titanic went down, this was cutting-edge drama for its day. The flick itself was a screen adaptation of a play George Marlow himself had produced in Australia the previous year. Bearing remarkable similarities to the plot of The Silence of Dean Maitland, it played-up two social aspects for which Marlow was long associated - sex and scandal! Murder, adultery, theft, surprise confessions and alcoholism all played a significant part here in the tale of a woman from most definitely the wrong part of town, who seduces an innocent young clergyman. You just didn't DO those things in 1912! Well to cut a long story short, Miss Guilford does JUST that and spends the rest of the film rueing her actions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040154</url></doc>
