<plot>When Sarah's dog disappears into the forest, she becomes completely lost trying to find him. After spending the night in the wilderness, Sarah runs into Peter, a survivalist type dressed in full combat gear, who promises to lead her out of the woods. But can she trust him? And where is he really taking her? When she begins to question his sanity, she decides to take her chances on her own, only to run into another pair, who on the surface appear to be escaped prisoners on the run. Convinced that Peter is tracking her, she turns to them for help. But do they really know the way out? As they try to keep one step ahead of Peter, it becomes clear that there is someone else in the woods, someone who is watching them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?601068</url></doc>
