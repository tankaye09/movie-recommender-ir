<plot>This film is about seduction, bad decisions and a world where things are out of place. What can a young man learn in a place where he does not belong; to which he was lured by others or by his false dreams. Can one keep one's inner harmony in a foreign place, where one cannot live according to one's own standards? Four youths are the protagonists of this film. One couple feels at home in this world; they look nice, want to get rich, drive an expensive car and wear expensive clothes. The other girl wears clumsy shoes, daydreams constantly, and dates a klutzy security guard with torn underwear. Such characters cross our path every day, but we pass them unaware. We know they are born losers. But now they are the protagonists and we have to pay attention to them. A modern tale, emotional and ironic, today in Budapest in the year 2000.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252683</url></doc>
