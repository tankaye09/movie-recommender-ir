<plot>The story is about a girl who is naive and happy. The girl suddenly gets an illness, and needs to get rid of it at all costs, since she cannot live with the disability. She also thinks about suicide. In order to rid herself of her disease, she decides to take matters into her own hands since she doesn't fear death anymore. After extensive research into the subject, she attempts to electrify a specific point in her brain in order to erase the part of the brain that gives the wrong signals to her body, causing her illness in the first place. When she does this she loses different abilities of expression, mental and physical, revealed by changes in her behaviour. Although she succeeds in erasing the part of the brain which causes the illness, it is a miracle in the eyes of her doctors. Though with it, she erases her personality friends and memories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193270</url></doc>
