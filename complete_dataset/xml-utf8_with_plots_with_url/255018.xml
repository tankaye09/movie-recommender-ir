<plot>"I'm A Ballerina Now" was created to inspire and help children realize their dreams of becoming a dancer. It is a complete ballet class for young beginners. Lyrics are sung to beautiful music which aid the child in remembering the dance exercises and performing them correctly. The young dancer's dream is visualized during each exercise when a real ballerina appears and performs the same steps which the child is working on. This program is also an excellent guide for a dance school for their children. It shows the types of exercises that should be a part of every ballet class.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255018</url></doc>
