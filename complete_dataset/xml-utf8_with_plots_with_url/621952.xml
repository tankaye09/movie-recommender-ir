<plot>Each time a neighborhood shop closes its doors for good, something vital is lost forever. Twilight Becomes Night examines the pivotal role of neighborhood stores in our individual lives, our communities, and in our society as a whole. Using the streets and shops of New York City as a backdrop, the film moves beyond nostalgic regret to reveal a high-stakes transformation and its potential to affect us all. Twilight Becomes Night is an intimate and emotional portrait of the struggle of small businesses today. It also explores the issues that are threatening neighborhood stores - the large chains, high rents, and public policy, among others. And yet, in the end, it reminds us of the power of individual commitment and community activism in preserving local business.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621952</url></doc>
