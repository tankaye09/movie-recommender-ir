<plot>There are few stories better known or more beloved that the American Origin story. Indeed, any schoolchild can recite at least a few lines from the Declaration of Independence, or tell you about Paul Revere's infamous Midnight Ride. Except none of it is true... Centuries of campfire stories have spun America's history into a fanciful tale filled with myths and half truths. MK12's History of America is here to set the record straight. Set against the warm sin of Las Vegas and the cold vacuum of space, this is the true story behind the story -- one which chronicles the epic struggle between the Astronauts and the cowboys as they fight for life, liberty and justice for all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564542</url></doc>
