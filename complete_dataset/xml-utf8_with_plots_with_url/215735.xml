<plot>Kyoko is a photographer struggling to find a balance between commerce and art. In her hunt for a model, she meets Miho, a young woman who's never confronted the father that left her when she was a child. In their short time together as photographer and subject, they form a strong bond, learning just as much about themselves as they do about each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215735</url></doc>
