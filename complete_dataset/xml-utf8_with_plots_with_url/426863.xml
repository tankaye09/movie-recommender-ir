<plot>Gangaprasad Trivedi would like his son, Kiran Kumar, to get married and settle down. He even goes to the extent of selecting a bride, Sheela Chaturvedi, for him. He asks Kiran to go and see the bride to-be, as well as meet his future-inlaws. Kiran is reluctant to do so, as he has fallen in love with Jyoti, but is unable to muster any courage to propose to her, as he is terrified of her dad. So Kiran sends Mahesh in his place, and this results in hilarious chaos, that change everyone's lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426863</url></doc>
