<plot>This is fastpaced drama about sexual harassment in the workplace from a child's perspective. The "Beautiful Dreamer Salon" is owned by Eva, a single parent who manages to juggle her clients, her employees, and her daughter, all in a day's work. Her multicultural clientele interact in hilarious sequences with the equally diverse hairdressers. The film allows a deeper look at sexual harassment on the job and other issues that lie just below the surface of everyday life in the workplace</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429447</url></doc>
