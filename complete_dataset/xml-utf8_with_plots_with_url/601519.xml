<plot>Giles Bateson is expelled from college for misconduct. His angry father, the Earl, sends him a message: "Never let me see you again until you have earned a half crown and proven yourself worthy of confidence." Giles meets Sally, the parson's daughter, who believes Giles to be the gardener. On a walk, they meet some gypsies, who show Sally a "magical ring." Giles buys it for her, and Sally comes to believe in its power when her wishes -- such as for a new dress and shoes to wear to the Earl's party for the villagers -- come true, although actually Giles is responsible. At the party, Sally accidentally discovers the note from the Earl and realizes who Giles really is. She determines to reconcile father and son, and begins visiting the Earl each day to play chess and distract him from the pain he suffers from gout. The gypsies tell her that she can find an herbal cure at Devil's Cliff, but when Sally doesn't return home, a search party finds her lying unconscious by the herb. The Earl is upset to hear of her accident and goes to visit her; when his horse goes lame in the village, he unwittingly borrows one from his own son for half a crown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?601519</url></doc>
