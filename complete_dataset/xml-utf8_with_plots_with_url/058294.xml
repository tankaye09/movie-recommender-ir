<plot>When the Mexican government's super spy satellite EL CORAZON 11764 is shot out of the sky by Al Quaida Extremists, armed with a black market Soviet rocket, and crash-lands in the cannibal infested Nagaland jungle outside of India, the race begins. The computer heart of the satellite, filled with stolen secrets... becomes a sought-after prize by spies, fortune hunters and criminals alike. But, if getting to El Corazon is an adventure... penetrating her metal hull is a nearly impossible mission. Because the satellite is laced with one high tech locking device on top of another... and failure to open any one lock, will lead to a horrific death. Enter Bandido, a mysterious enigma, part spy smasher and international adventurer, one part master thief extraordinarily. He's the only man in the world with half a chance to survive the Satellite's deadly tricks long enough to steal her priceless heart. Now the Mexican government wants to hire Bandido! The CIA wants to hire Bandido! Even an Indian crime lord named BULL wants to hire Bandido! There's only one problem: Bandido doesn't want the job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058294</url></doc>
