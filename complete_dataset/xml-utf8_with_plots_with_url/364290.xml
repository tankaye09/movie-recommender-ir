<plot>Mumbai Police Inspector Vijay Kumar is in love with Journalist Priya and both hope to get married soon. Priya then comes across incriminating evidence against Mantri Satya Swami and is all set to expose him through the media. Before that could happen, she gets killed. The Police investigate but are unable to locate her killer. A year and a half later, Vijay meets with Suman, both fall in love and get married. When several men are killed by a female killer, who is nicknamed 'Pyassi', the police are baffled, and the Commissioner assigns this investigation to Vijay, who takes over and begins to examine all previously closed files of female killers. Even while investigating, two more violent deaths, those of Arun and Karan, occur. When Vijay does not come with any clues, the pressure mounts on him through the Commissioner to apprehend this elusive killer who continues to elude the Police with impunity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?364290</url></doc>
