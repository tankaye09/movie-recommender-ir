<plot>Set in Malaya during the Japanese occupation in the 1940s, this film tells the story of a girl, Embun, who's thrown into the forefront of the struggle against the Japanese when her freedom-fighter brother, Bayu, and father are detained by the Japanese. In the midst of it all, she's also attracted to the Japanese army public relations man, Koishi, who is assigned to explain the Japanese propaganda to the Malays and win their support. Koishi also has a personal mission to fulfil in Malaya to find the Malay man who married his mother (in other words, his father) when she served as a Japanese spy prior to the occupation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176326</url></doc>
