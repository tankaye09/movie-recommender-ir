<plot>Susan is a closed book. She wishes her blind date, Leonard, wasn't quite so open. At the very least he could have the decency to turn to a more discreet page. Their story begins at ten seconds before the New Year, that magical, oppressive moment when everything is possible, but nothing's really changed. Sometimes the only thing worse than being alone is being exposed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255631</url></doc>
