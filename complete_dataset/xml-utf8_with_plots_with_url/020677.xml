Deepak loves Mala, introduces her to him mom, and soon they are married. Mala has eye problems, and eventually loses her sight. While travelling, Deepak has an accident and his body is nowhere to be found. Deepak's mom blames a pregnant Mala for this bad luck, and throws her out of the house. Mala gives birth to a baby girl, and both live a very poor and destitute life. Deepak has met with Asha several times, and would like to marry her. Asha would also like to marry Deepak.
