<plot>Debbie (_sic_) is a young woman who is running a drygoods store with her sweetheart, a fine young man who buys her a bracelet for $20. Unable to raise the $20, he is threatened with the loss of the store. Also, an elderly lady protests that Toto has been digging holes in her lawn, although Toto was played by a puppy barely able to walk. The lady kidnaps Toto in her market basket, but he is rescued by Debbie's sweetheart. A cyclone comes and and Debbie gets hit on the head. She is not killed but awakes to find herself dreaming that she is in Oz. The plot then follows the MGM film even to the dialogue until Glinda sends Debbie and Toto back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?601630</url></doc>
