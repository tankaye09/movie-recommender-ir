<plot>Gokusen is the story of recently graduated Kumiko Yamaguchi, aka. Yankumi, and her life as a new high school teacher. Unlike the other new teachers at her school Kumiko gets placed with teh toughest kids there. And has to deal with all their rebellious actions. However as time passes she gains her students respect by helping them out both in school and in their daily lives. Which is easy for her to do as her students remind her of her life at home, since she is a fourth generation crime syndicate member and next in line to head it up. She's gone straight and wants to be a teacher though, but she's one person in whose class you don't want to be caught fooling around!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218780</url></doc>
