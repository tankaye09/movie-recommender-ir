<plot>Beethoven is particularly acclaimed for his orchestral works, including symphonies and concertos, plus sonatas and chamber music. The highly expressive music Beethoven produced, infused with a sense of his own struggles to overcome adversity, for centuries has inspired composers like Brahms, Mendelssohn, and Wagner, and continue to do so today. These informative programs are a concise overview of the composer's life and times, filmed on location in the cities and places that influenced their works. Also included in a detailed list of each composer's most significant musical compositions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188983</url></doc>
