<plot>At the end of each season, at popular Atlantic City, New Jersey, a floral parade takes place, composed wholly of children. Thousands of tots are seen walking along the board-walk arrayed in flowers, and the picture is a pleasing sight to see. The value of this film could be enhanced two-fold by coloring.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?050088</url></doc>
