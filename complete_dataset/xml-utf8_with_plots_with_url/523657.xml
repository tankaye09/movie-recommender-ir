<plot>Susanne Sillemann is seven years old. She would like to make a wish that she had another name. As a matter of fact, she would like to make a wish that many things were different in her life, and she manages to do so. She discovers a magic charm, and suddenly she finds that she can wish for all the changes in her life that she wants. One day, she happens to make a wish that she sincerely regrets, something with awful consequences. But she can't take it back. Her magic formula doesn't work anymore. What do you think, can she manage to escape from her fantasy world?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523657</url></doc>
