<plot>Set in present day Rome, Freddy &amp; Victor blind date portrays the first meeting between a father and daughter. Federica the tomboy daughter is 19 years old, Victor the father 51. They have never seen each other before. She has just begun to experiment with film and hangs out in squats in Rome and London. He is an actor and poet, lives in Rome and gets by "doing the least possible". She is left wing, he claims to be right wing. She enjoys going for walks, the thought of which gives him a headache. All they apparently have in common is their loyalty to the same soccer team, the "magic" Roma.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203158</url></doc>
