<plot>In Wetonkawa, Oklahoma, they have one claim to fame and his name is Harley Henson, a.k.a., "The Wetonkawa Flash" - the greatest football player in state history. If this man hadn't suffered his debilitating knee injury, well sir, there'd be statues of him in the Football Hall of Fame. Twenty years later, the shine is wearing off Wetonkawa's golden boy. His only son won't speak to him, his wife wants a divorce so she can marry his brother and his state rushing record, the one thing he always had, is about to be broken. But thanks to an overzealous preacher, an attempted assassination by the town dog catcher and a little divine intervention, the Wetonkawa Flash is about to become a legend once again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600570</url></doc>
