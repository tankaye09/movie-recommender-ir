When Bollywood actress Kiran throws a tantrum and walks out on his movie, Vijay is introduced to a prostitute by the name of Gauri. He likes Gauri and signs her up for his movie. Both Gauri and he get intimate, and as a result Gauri gets pregnant and gives birth to a daughter. Then Gauri meets with a young and wealthy movie financier by the name of Prince Kumar, and decides not to have to do anything with Vijay. She wants to bring up Vijay's daughter as a prostitute like herself, so that she is provided for in her old age.
