<plot>Action packed story of how Jim Haygood (James Glehart) young, black and brilliant becomes the legendary leader of a rebel army. In a daring ambush on the beach Moncada, elusive leader of the rebel army, is captured by Jim Haygood and turned over to the authorities. That night, Jim celebrates his success in a nightclub, where he meets two glamorous young girl entertainers, Amanda of the High Wire (Carol Speed) and Vicky the Knife-Thrower (Lada Edmund Jr.). A reporter bursts in with the news that Moncada is dead, accusing Jim of the cold-blooded murder of the rebel leader. Jim gets in a fight with his superiors over this and knocks out his commanding officer. Jim is put under arrest but pulls off a clever escape when he is being transported to the military prison. He hides out in Amanda and Vicky's dressing-room. During a raid by the military police, Vicky is caught and interned but Jim commandeers an army jeep and escapes into the mountains with Amanda. Jim and Amanda are then taken prisoner by the rebel forces but in a major battle between the rebels and the army Jim proves his true colors. In a brilliant coup he redirects the enemy planes to attack their own troops. From then on, through a swift series of daring exploits Jim Haygood emerges as the new rebel leader, "SAVAGE" in name and deed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?478934</url></doc>
