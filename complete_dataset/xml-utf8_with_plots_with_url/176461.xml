<plot>Based on the legend of the Shinjong, a massive bell now in Kyeongju, which was cast during the reign of King Seong-deok in order to stop a war. Each person in the region contributed to be smelted into the bell, except for one woman who had nothing to give. However the first time it was cast, the bell would not ring. It was determined that it was because not everyone had contributed something, so the woman offered her newborn child which she sacrificed into the molten metal. The bell was completed and successfully tolled, preventing a war but to this day, the bell's reverberations sound like a baby wailing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176461</url></doc>
