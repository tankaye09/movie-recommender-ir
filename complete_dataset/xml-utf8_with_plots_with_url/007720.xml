<plot>"A Blink of Paradise" is a twelve minute investigation into the event that caused one woman's first memory. Obsessed by past images of herself as a baby in a carriage, she uncovers a simple fact concerning her mother that explains why she has been haunted by them ever since. This is realized through an interweaving of her present life (on a therapist's couch) and the visual fragments she has retained of that day. Having located the source of her pain, she is now able to go forward with newfound understanding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007720</url></doc>
