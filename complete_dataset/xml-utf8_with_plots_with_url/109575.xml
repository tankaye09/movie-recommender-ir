<plot>Paul's New York buddies warned him about the shadiness of some people in Los Angeles, but after spending nearly eight years in the army and ten years in New York City, Paul felt the TV and film capitol of the world would be no problem. After going to the best 2 year acting program in New York (Maggie Flanigan Studio), a few years of working the local agents and casting directors with little results, then carefully planning a permanent move to the city of angels (L.A.) after a productive showcase a few months prior, it all seems to go everything but smooth in this true story of how Paul gets caught up in the robbery of a jewelry store that gets him thrown in jail, looking at hard times. Paul now finds himself using his resources along with circumstances to figure out away to land back on his feet running. "Coast To Coast Diaries" is a story about finding balance in relationships between friends, girlfriends, teachers, parents, careers, all within our daily, unpredictable and sometimes chaotic lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109575</url></doc>
