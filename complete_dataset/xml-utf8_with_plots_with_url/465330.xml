<plot>I never knew my father. I was one year old when he died and my mother never talked to me about him. Neither have I asked, it was an agreeable silence. At the age of twenty four I felt that it was time to know. I went on a journey trying to understand who he was through the people who knew him and the houses where he lived. I've both directed, held the interviews and photographed the whole time as it was important for me to preserve my real, temporal point of view of me, and the development of my journey and i wanted to expose the viewers to this experience as directly as possible. At first I interviewed my mother, who's giving me information for the first time, and then I had some clues. From there on I move between the three countries where he used to live - France, Israel and Chicago. Slowly, I began to realize who he was, and accordingly - who I am.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465330</url></doc>
