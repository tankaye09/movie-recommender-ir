<plot>Both Jack Horton's father and then his brother have been killed with an ace of clubs left on their body. Attracted to McGill's newly arrived niece, Jack visits her and finds the two decks of cards with the club aces missing. Having been spotted by McGill's men who were rustling the Horton cattle, he apparently becomes the next victim when a club ace is placed on his unconcious body.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?538901</url></doc>
