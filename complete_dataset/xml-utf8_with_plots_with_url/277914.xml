One day he witnesses his master being killed by a Poacher and his two brothers, and marks his master's grave with 3 numbers. Years later, a wrestler by the name of Munna, wins Ganesh as his prize and brings him home. Shortly thereafter, Ganesh witnesses his first master's killers and kills two of them. Before he could arrange the death of the Poacher, Munna's ailing mom is abducted from the hospital and Munna himself ends up being captured by the Poacher.
