<plot>Carmen is just like a regular girl growing up and dealing with everything that comes with the changes of adolescence. While she prepares to go to school, her mother keeps bothering her with every small detail, especially her shoes, which she doesn't like because they make too much noise. She feels at ease only when she is alone in her room, trying to fix her shoes, so they can't make any more noise. The next day she feels confident and nothing can disturb her, but she has this moment of truth that makes her realize her real strength is within her, not in her shoes. This knowledge makes her confident enough to stand out and make people notice she is not longer a little girl.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442752</url></doc>
