<plot>Year one: Naples rises on the tomb of Parthenope. Year 1996: a peaceful clammer is subjected to the advances of two enigmatic characters over the course of a typical day. Who is the "woman"? Why does she have a body guard? What is their mission? The person goes through a marketinferno, but this is not his world. He goes away from it and stays apart from it to a place where he will never see a clam. For this reason the "woman" has "chosen" him. And it is in this place that she will reveal herself and get what she wants.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391871</url></doc>
