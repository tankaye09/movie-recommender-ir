<plot>For Gareth, it rains every day. He starts to want things that men aren't supposed to want. He wants to have someone to hug and to hold. He wants to meet a nice woman. For his flat mate this is too much to stomach. Calvin believes that agents are following him from some shadowy government agency. While Leon, well Leon is just plain weird. Gareth has never been the most forward man in the world, talking to women has never been easy at the best of times. So when Calvin explains the concept of 'alternate universes' to Gareth he starts him thinking. What if out of all the different Gareths, in all the different universes, he is the one who is permanently unlucky in love? What if he is the one who is destined to go without? While Gareth may not fully understand the whole alternate universes concept there is one thing he does understand. Unless he takes action soon. He may be left in a universe all by himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282159</url></doc>
