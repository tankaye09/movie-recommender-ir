<plot>In caste and religion laden India there are some people who work together without any bias - they are underworld dons and gangster - and their prime motive is to amass as much money as possible. Rukavat Singh is one such gangster, who has two lieutenants - Sultan, and Vishwa Mohan. No one has dared to stand up against any of these three. Until Inspector Durga came along - but then she was brutally burned alive, and the case was handled as a "suicide" and the file was closed. Then came Inspector Vishal - he ended up being crippled and his wife brutally raped and killed in his presence. And now Inspector Prashant Verma has been assigned to this area. He is quite different from the other police officers, as he is easy-going, alcoholic, and quite capable of turning the nelson's eye on crime. And then suddenly Rukavat and his men start ending up dead. Will Prashant use his resources to find the culprit(s) or will be continue in his easy-going way?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065266</url></doc>
