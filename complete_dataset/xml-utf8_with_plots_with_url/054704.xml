<plot>A shy archaeologist living in Kyoto is driving home from his tenth high school reunion when he accidentally hits a cyclist. The cyclist turns out to be a young Nepalese man named Krishna who has come to Japan to earn money for his family. Feeling bad about hitting him with his car, the archaeologist tries to help him out by offering to let Krishna stay at his place, showing him around Kyoto, and inviting him along on his business trips around Japan. Although there is initially a great deal of friction created by the cultural differences between the two, the archaeologist gradually comes to understand more about Krishna, and more about himself as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054704</url></doc>
