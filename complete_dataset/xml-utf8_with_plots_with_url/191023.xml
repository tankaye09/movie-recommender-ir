<plot>'Fatty' and his bossy, stingy wife are visiting the park at the same time that another couple is there. When his wife refuses to buy him a soft drink, Fatty walks over to a drinking fountain. Meanwhile, the other man, who is a purse snatcher, has targeted Fatty's wife as his next victim. Fatty notices the purse snatcher's pretty companion sitting on a bench by herself, and begins to flirt with her even as the purse snatcher is trying to evade a policeman who has spotted him at work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191023</url></doc>
