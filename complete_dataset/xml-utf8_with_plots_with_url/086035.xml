<plot>This picture was secured from a launch furnished by Mr. Eager, President of the California Construction Co., who are fulfilling this $5,000,000 contract. Here is seen the largest derrick in the world at work, showing the huge arms straining and swaying. The spray effects are very fine, as the huge rocks strike the water, sending beautiful masses of foam hundreds of feet in the air and drenching the men at work on the cars. The derrick is at work on a long pier which extends out in the sea for a distance of about two miles, and for this reason we are obliged to secure our pictures from a launch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086035</url></doc>
