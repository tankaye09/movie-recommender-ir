<plot>A*mazing was an Australian children's television game show that aired in the mid to late 1990s on the Seven Network. It was famous for a relatively large and elaborate maze/obstacle course that was part of the show's studio set. The show pitted teams from two different schools against each other during the course of a week. Hosted by James Sherry, A*mazing became one of the longest and most watched children's programs on Australian TV.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019560</url></doc>
