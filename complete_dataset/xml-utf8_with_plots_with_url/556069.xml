<plot>The Experimental Witch tells the story of Athena whose adoptive parents take her home to Lebanon from Romania. Her mother, Samira soon finds that her daughter has premonitions and struggles to accept this. Samira's fears and lack of understanding of Athena's roots lead Athena to set out on a journey of self discovery and in search of her birth mother. Athena feels that once she finds her, her desire for a deeper understanding of the empty feeling she holds inside will disappear. She struggles in her relationship with Samira, her adoptive mother who can not understand Athena's desires to find her true identity and gypsy heritage. These two women take you on a journey into one of the most complex relationships life gives us; the one between a mother and daughter and their desire to be loved and accepted for who they really are.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556069</url></doc>
