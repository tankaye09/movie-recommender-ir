<plot>There is no documentation that any film bearing this title was either produced or distributed by Biograph or General or directed by D.W. Griffith at this time. Production may have been suspended before completion or else the film may have been released under a different title. An entirely different film, The Flaming Arrows, was, however released by Pathe in 1911 (q.v.).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196943</url></doc>
