<plot>The untold story of my great-great aunt Beate Berger, and the "Beith Ahawah Kinderheim" she founded in 1922 in Berlin for Jewish children in need. It is the story of her courageous decision, during the early 1930s, to save "her" children from Nazi Germany, and the unique rescue operation that followed. She succeeded in bringing the children to the new "Ahawah" home she built in the Haifa Bay (then Palestine). This is a film about memory, about hope and about an amazing rescue operation run by one woman who had the historical vision and understanding of the reality in 1933 Berlinthat few others had. But, most of all, it is a film about the love that was the essence of "Beith Ahawah" in Auguststar√üe 14-16, Berlin. Ayelet Bargur studied Art at TelAviv University and Film at Camera Obscura. Her graduation film, "A Good Place to Be" and her TV drama "As if Nothing Happened" were screened at festivals around the world and won a number of awards. Selected filmography: "As if Nothing Happened" ('99), "At the End of the Day" ('00), "Children of the Night" ('01), "Ras Pina" ('01), "So Near So Far" ('03).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?565451</url></doc>
