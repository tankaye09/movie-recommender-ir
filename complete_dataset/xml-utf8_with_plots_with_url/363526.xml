<plot>Contemporary Russia &amp; Ukraine. Pretty, young Alya (Tatyana Arntgolts) has just graduated from high school. Though she had hoped to hide it from her parents a little while longer, they have discovered that she is pregnant. Alya, knowing otherwise, tells them the father is Zhenya (Aleksandr Lymarev), a childhood friend of hers. To help Alya, Zhenya agrees to go along with the ruse, at least for a while. Her parents reach a decision: Alya and Zhenya must marry. As a wedding present, their friends and families send them for their honeymoon to a resort on the Black Sea in Odessa, Ukraine. But, they are not alone. Alya had invited her secret lover Andrey (Aleksandr Domogarov) to the wedding. Andrey, much older than Alya, is her father's boss. Already married, with a home and family, Andrey had seen Alya as nothing more than a convenient lover. But, when he sees her get married, Andrey feels passionately jealous, and becomes blindly obsessed with getting her back. He abandons his job, his wife and home, and follows Alya and Zhenya to Odessa. All of this, Alya had planned. But, she and Zhenya will soon learn that Andrey wants her back at any cost... even unto death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363526</url></doc>
