<plot>On the southernmost tip of Madagascar lives Efiaimbelo, a man in his sixties who works as a funerary sculptor. To ornament local tombs honoring the dead, he carves and paints wooden poles topped with amazing scenes of animals, people and tableaux associated with the deceased. Nera Jambruk heads a team of men in Papua New Guinea who build and paint the magnificent spirit houses in each village. Working day and night, they create a huge triangle of bark covered with paintings of abstract faces surrounded by triangular designs and stylized flowers and animals. These dramatic images retell the story of the first birth and have magical powers to affect daily life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351961</url></doc>
