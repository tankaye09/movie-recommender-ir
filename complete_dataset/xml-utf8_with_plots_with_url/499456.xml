<plot>The rapture is coming... in five days. How will you spend your time? If you are Mims, the martini-drinking playboy hero of Six Days in the Life of Mims, you will probably spend it as you would any other six days of your life: pursuing pleasure, friendship, and the perfect Cuban sandwich. When they learn of the impending rapture from a street corner prophet, Mims and his friends decide to prepare for the rapture in the best way they know how: by planning a party to celebrate the Earth's deliverance. As the party approaches, Mims continues to live a playboy's life, aided by his faithful butler Starky and all the while stalked by Dr. Suzanne Click, an evil academic who is bent on his destruction. With a cast of characters that includes a Viking, a hillbilly, a hobo, and a bounty hunter, Six Days in the Life of Mims is an offbeat comedy featuring a hero who can look adversity squarely in the eye and declare, "I'll drink to that!"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499456</url></doc>
