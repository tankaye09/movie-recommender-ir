<plot>Jerrold Jarvis Jones, a lowly shipping clerk, falls asleep on his office stool and has a dream: He is an aggressive, carefully groomed man of the world who welcomes adventure when an attractive girl addresses him as Tourvaine and takes him on an automobile ride. He is taken to a meeting of a secret criminal society known as "Children of the Night" and is mistaken for a new leader who was to arrive from abroad, a role he assumes until exposed. In a series of fights with the crooks, he rescues Sylvia (in real life a secretary in his office) and mingles in the world of high society. Awakening from his dream, he is fired with ambition and astonishes everyone by walking out with the stenographer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103285</url></doc>
