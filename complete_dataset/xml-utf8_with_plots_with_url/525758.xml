<plot>The scene opens by showing the village girls driving home a herd of cows, and shows the native peasantry of Switzerland returning from their daily occupation watching the herds. After driving the cattle to their shelter, the boys and girls congregate in front of the old barn and go through a native dance, to the amusement of the spectators. These pictures are marvelously clear and distinct, showing every feature of the participants.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525758</url></doc>
