<plot>This is the action-packed tale of two buddies who race around Europe as part of an elite group who race in only the finest, highest-ticket cars available with Italian names that are legend. Ferrari. Maserati. Lambourghini. (There's also some non-Italians in the mix, like Aston-Martins.) Of course, there *has* to be more to the movie than just racing around Europe, right? Of course there is... the two pals are actually outlaws, using the underground racing marathon as a cover for a heist. Not just any heist, but that one big heist that all heist aficianados seek out, that big heist that will allow them to stop pulling off heists and spend the rest of their lives in luxury. You know, like the kind of luxury that allows you to race around Europe in Maseratis and Lambourghinis.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452674</url></doc>
