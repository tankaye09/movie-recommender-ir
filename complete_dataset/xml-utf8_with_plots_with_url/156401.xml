<plot>In the sinful city streets life can be tough on the human heart, and in Laura's world now frequented by junkies, dealers, thugs and cops, she knows, just like the rest of them that losing your head can leave you for dead. A gun-shot reverberates through the city streets intertwining the destinies of all these lost souls;can they outrun it? Or will the truth about love hit them all? Laura is not finding it easy, especially when the nation is transfixed by LAW TV, the televised trial of two cops for viciously beating and shooting Trevor Lyons, a gifted and attractive soccer player; because as it turns out, Jack, her first lover, might just be involved. JIM a snitch paid with heroin is most certainly implicated. But it is RUSSELL, her unexpected new love who triggers the realization of her intense re-occurring dream; and her sexual awakening. Shot of Love; they're all dying to get their hands on it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156401</url></doc>
