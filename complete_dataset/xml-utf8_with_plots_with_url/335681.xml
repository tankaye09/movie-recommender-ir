<plot>A complete reproduction of the "Life and Passion of Christ," as enacted annually since 1816 by the peasants of the mountain town of Horitz, Bohemia. This magnificent production cost over $10,000 and required over three weeks of constant labor on the part of the large staff of operators. About 300 people take part in the play, which is staged and costumed in a most elaborate manner. This is the finest reproduction of the Passion Play that has ever been made, and it is well to remember that the Oberammergau Passion Play has never been reproduced in its original form by motion-photography. The Horitz play is more graphic and more replete with interesting situations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335681</url></doc>
