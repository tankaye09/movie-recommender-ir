<plot>We show here one of the grandest pieces of scenery in the West, namely, "Kicking Horse Cañon" on the line of the Canadian Pacific R.R. This vast cañon is fourteen miles long, running through the Rocky Mountains at an altitude of 5,000 feet above the sea level. The train from which our picture was made ran along the very brink of the mountain with the valley thousands of feet below, making the picture most thrilling. The train is going at a high rate of speed, thus giving a long and diverisifed view as it rushes through the cañon and rounds the sharp curves at breakneck speed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422078</url></doc>
