<plot>Jake tries to talk to his father about the changes that have been occurring in his life, the most difficult being a new, serious relationship with a woman who has a child from a previous marriage. Just like his potential stepson, Mikey, Jake needs the support and understanding of an older man, and, for the first time since childhood, he's hoping to get that from his father. In a surprising moment of insight, Jake finally begins to see his father as he is rather than as Jake wishes he would be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666546</url></doc>
