<plot>A friend of Dick Bailey (Richard Arlen) is killed by a mysterious assailant, whom Dick suspects to be Stack (Fred Kohler), who is in league with the crooked sheriff (Guy Oliver.) Out on a spree Dick swears he will marry the first woman he sees, who happens to be Ruth Hammond (Mary Brian), sister of his dead friend, arriving to take charge of the Hammond ranch. Revolted by his rough proposal,she fires him as the Hammond foreman and she proceeds to the ranch. Stack informs her he has purchased the ranch for the payment of the back-due taxes, and she relents and rehires Dick and his friends to aid her in her fight against Stack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?571070</url></doc>
