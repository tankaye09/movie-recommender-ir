<plot>This narrative documentary was shot during peak foliage season in Vermont. Russ Janney, owner of Apple Hill Farms and his golden retriever Sunshine, show us the in's and out's of a busy day in the orchard. From the busy farm stand to quiet time picking apples in the orchard, Russ provides us with a glimpse into the unforgiving life of an American farmer. Beautiful New England landscapes provide a stunning back drop to this quiet story of a hard working farmer and his beloved dog.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043774</url></doc>
