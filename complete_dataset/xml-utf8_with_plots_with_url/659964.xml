<plot>"Women" is a documentary about women who come to America to work illegally and send money back to Georgia to support their families. "Women" explores the lives of Georgian women in New York and New Jersey; their lifestyle and culture clashing with a new lifestyle and American culture. Each one of the women has a unique story to tell and their motives are different. These women are mothers, wives, sisters, daughters and in addition to that they are civilized slaves who are deliberately sacrificing their lives for their families.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659964</url></doc>
