<plot>The Bwindi Impenetrable Forest houses nearly half the world's Mountain Gorilla population, which currently number only about 700. But thanks to efforts like the Uganda Government at Bwindi Park, the population is recovering and growing slowly. However, to save the gorillas the Batwa Pygmies had to leave the forest to make room for the gorillas. They were promised compensation in the form of money, community projects, and a vote in the park committee. However, things did not work out exactly that way. The Batwa are different from many other marginalized peoples in Africa because, instead of a long history of oppression or war that creates a need, the Batwa simply lack Western style knowledge of how to compete for resources and recognition, but are waiting to be taught. From a pre-Stone-Age life in the Bwindi Forest to becoming an agrarian society is a big transition. The Kellermanns' ideas are to first attend to basic health and sanitation needs of the Batwa Pygmies and then schooling. Today, thanks to many individuals and organizations around the world this part is in place. Now, teaching them to stand on their own is the most important step. This requires a committment on the part of the Batwa as well. This project documents the Batwa culture before it is lost and we hope it will help instill the self-confidence and pride in the Batwa themselves which they will need to survive as a culture. It will also bring real visibility to the work going on at the edge of the Bwindi.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318792</url></doc>
