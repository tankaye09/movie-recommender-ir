<plot>A woman leaves a "Dear John" note for her lover and departs their flat. Later that day, burglars break in. A diffident thief, more interested in the ambience of the place than the swag, falls for the woman when he sees her photo. Trouble is, when he swipes her picture to put in his wallet, he leaves the billfold in the flat. When he goes back to retrieve it, the man of the house has returned and thinks his girlfriend has taken all his stuff. Then she arrives and maybe the burglar can get away with the crime and steal her heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109399</url></doc>
