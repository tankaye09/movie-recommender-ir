<plot>Jailed as a juvenile for killing his abusive father (Sudhir Kumar), Prithvi (Salman Khan) is unable to witness any atrocity without losing his temper. He meets with Maggie Pinto (Revathi Menon) and after a few more chance meetings, they both fall in love. Maggie takes Prithvi to meet her parents, and they reject him due to his violent background. Maggie and Prithvi persist, and Maggie's mom, Stella Pinto (Reeta Bhaduri) calls the police, and has Prithvi jailed. Guruji (Amjad Khan) comes to his aid, and bails him out. Both continue to meet, little knowing the tragedy awaiting both of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344281</url></doc>
