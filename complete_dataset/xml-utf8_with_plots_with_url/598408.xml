<plot>Ellinor, who was unofficially adopted as an orphan by 'Old Peter,' who maintained a lighthouse on a virtually deserted beach, has grown up wild and nearly silent. As she blossoms into full womanhood, she begins longing to know more about the world. One day a mutinous sailor swims to shore and declares that they are married, after tossing a pair of rings into the sea. He soon fleas, but promises to return for her. Wealthy widower George Hudson, the richest man in the nearby port village, also falls for the fascinating, attractive young woman. He convinces her to go to a refining school for a year and then to marry him. They both find that the sea still holds a powerful pull on one's soul. In the end, the question comes down to whether love or the sea's magic spell is stronger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598408</url></doc>
