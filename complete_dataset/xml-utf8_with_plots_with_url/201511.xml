<plot>3DO's dark action game casts the player as Abaddon (the angel of the bottomless pit), a fallen archangel exiled to Earth with the purpose of stopping the forthcoming apocalypse. The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death threaten to conquer all humanity if they are not stopped. To this end Abaddon must assemble an army of four himself to level the playing field. He must find three chosen mortals, blessed with the power to combat the Horsemen. They are a prostitute with healing powers, a tattooed preacher-turned-serial-killer with mystic demon-revealing sight, and a corrupt senator with great powers of persuasion. Once Abaddon and his chosen ones are ready, they must set forth to battle the machinations of the four dark riders, and save Earth from the coming of the apocalypse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201511</url></doc>
