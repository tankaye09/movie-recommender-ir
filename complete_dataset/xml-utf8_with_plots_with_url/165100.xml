<plot>Elizabeth, a young historian, visits an old wartime airbase which is now a museum. She meets Peter, thinking him to be an actor in RAF uniform as part of a 'revisit the past' day. But as she is drawn back to visit the museum to see Peter again, and learns more about the life of the airbase during the Battle of Britain, it seems that he is not what he appears to be. How can Elizabeth have met her soulmate, when he died forty years ago? And can they ever be together?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165100</url></doc>
