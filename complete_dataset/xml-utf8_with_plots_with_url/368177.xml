<plot>The fourth in the series of Animal Planet shows (known collectively as Animal Planet Heroes) following animal law enforcement, Miami Animal Police primarily follows the officers of the Miami-Dade Police Department Animal Services Unit (ASU). Unlike the other Animal Planet Heroes shows (Animal Precinct and Animal Cops) which follow private, non-profit, humane agencies, this is the first of these type shows on Animal Planet to follow a government based law enforcement agency that responds to animal issues. On the front lines for the ASU are civilian 20 animal control officers (ACO's), who are backed up by 5 civilian animal cruelty investigators, a pitbull investigator, and 6 administrative police officers from the Miami-Dade Police Department who handle any law enforcement issues that arise, including arresting those suspected of animal cruelty. In addition to the ASU, Miami Animal Police also follows two companies that remove exotic nuisance wildlife in the Miami area, Everglades Outpost and Pesky Critters, and several Miami area animal rescue agencies. In addition, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officer Patrick Reynolds is also featured.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?368177</url></doc>
