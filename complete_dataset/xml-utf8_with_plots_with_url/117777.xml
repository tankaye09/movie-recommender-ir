<plot>"Crash Course" pairs up relatives, friends and other related twosomes and not only puts their navigating skills to the test, but test drives their relationships and patience, making the teams work together and summon their greatest driving skills to make it across the finish line. Each week, five teams of two will competed and be eliminated one by one before facing the final "Crash Course" for a chance to win $50,000.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117777</url></doc>
