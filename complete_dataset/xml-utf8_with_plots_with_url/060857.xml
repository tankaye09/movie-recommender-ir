<plot>The film begins and ends on the same scene: a close-up of the bare legs, from below the knee to the feet, of a woman who is apparently lying on a beach mat or blanket. The action shows a trick bird or an insect of some kind constantly flying around the legs and causing them to cross and uncross steadily during the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060857</url></doc>
