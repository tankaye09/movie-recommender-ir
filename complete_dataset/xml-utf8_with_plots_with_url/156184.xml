<plot>Donald is a meek, wrinkled, cute old man. He tends to his favorite garden that gives him peace from his overbearing wife. One day, a truck arrives delivering a kumquat tree. Carmen, his wife proclaims "I love kumquats!" Now having to replace the one thing he loves with a sour kumquat tree, Donald must draw the line in protest. Unfortunately, Donald's will is no match for Carmen who decides to replace the tree herself. Upon discovering that Donald's dying tree is poisonous, he decides to poison Carmen. On first attempt, she not only is still alive, she's become pleasant to be around. On second attempt, her age spots have cleared up. Finally, determined to kill her, Donald makes a heavy dosage only to have her lose some weight and increase her lusty desire for him. The aphrodisiac finally wearing off, Carmen dies at the climax of their lovemaking. Now at peace, Donald empties the house of her belongings. After some time however, Donald starts missing her like a tongue running over the gums of a missing tooth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156184</url></doc>
