<plot>A Danish documentary series about a new Copenhagen school for elite students, tracking the achievements and trials of the young men and women who have been accepted. The students include David, who struggles with the workload and divides his time between school and a hip-hop group, Peter, who wants to be a company manager but doesn't bother much with homework, Maria, who works harder than anybody, Simon, who wants to make up for lost time in earlier school years, and Mille, who ends up leaving the school because she has trouble keeping up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236513</url></doc>
