<plot>A most beautiful subject is the launch of the Kaiser's yacht Meteor, which was christened by the daughter of the President of the United States. On the platform is seen President Roosevelt, Prince Henry of Prussia, Miss Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the President, and who christened the yacht, and other prominent American and German officials. As the bottle is broken on the bow of the vessel, she glides gracefully into the water and can be plainly seen lying out about 300 feet from where she started, beautifully decorated with flags. The Prince turns toward the audience and makes a short speech which enables one to see him plainly. An inspiring subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321348</url></doc>
