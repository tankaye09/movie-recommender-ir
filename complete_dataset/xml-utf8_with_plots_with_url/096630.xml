<plot>One of Samuel Beckett's shortest plays. A director and his assistant prepare an aged man for a public spectacle for a political purpose. The play was dedicated to the Czech dissident Vaclev Havel and was recently revived by the director and scientist Stephen Armourae as part of his 'New Blood' Theatre Season. The role of the aged protagonist was shared between Armourae and the actress Rosanna Hoult as a means of subverting Beckett's messages till further by presenting either Armourae or the very pretty Rosanna as the supposedly aged man as described in Beckett's text: Armourae and Hoult have worked as models.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096630</url></doc>
