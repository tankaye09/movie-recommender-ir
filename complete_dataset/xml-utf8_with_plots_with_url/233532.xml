<plot>This documentary delves into such horror and sci-fi subjects as vampires, make-up and special effects, low budget B-movies from the 1950s to the 1990s, comedy and horror, and women in horror. It also has tributes to Forrest J Ackerman, The Night of the Living Dead, and William Castle's career as well as an "ingredients of horror" sequence presented by Elvira and a trivia quiz at the end. In between the segments is host George Hamilton with commentary and interviews with filmmakers on what they do and what horror means to them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233532</url></doc>
