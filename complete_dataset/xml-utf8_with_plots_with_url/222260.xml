<plot>A large number of Bishops, Priests, and laymen are seen in this procession, which is headed by his Eminence, Cardinal Kopp, of Germany. The Cardinal, who is the highest Catholic official throughout the German Empire, is seen walking under a great canopy which is mounted with gold and supported by two dozen men. Along the line of march, which is around a small park, are erected small altars at which the Cardinal stops to pray. A very pretty scene, and the only one of its kind extant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222260</url></doc>
