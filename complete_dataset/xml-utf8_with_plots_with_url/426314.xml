<plot>Infatuated to the point of obsession with the beauty of a local village belle by the name of Bindiya, Rana Surajbhan Singh, will do anything to spend a night with her, but Bindiya comes from a respectable background and no amount of money will force her to spend even a few moments alone with the lusty Rana. Bindiya is in love with Amar, but Amar has fallen for Rana's niece, Rekha. Rana will not permit her to marry Amar under any circumstances. When Bindiya finds out that Rana is the only obstacle in Amar and Rekha's marriage, she agrees to do anything for Rana, much to his delight. Rana asks Bindiya to dance and strip for him, and as long as she continues to do so, Amar and Rekha will be kept alive. But can Bindiya trust Rana, who may change his mind, have his way with her, and order his men to kill Amar and Rekha?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426314</url></doc>
