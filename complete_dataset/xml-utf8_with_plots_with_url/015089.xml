<plot>Baby sits in his high chair and papa is playing with him. Papa is smoking his evening pipe. Baby claps his hands, points to pipe and wants it. So papa puts on baby's hood, and baby smokes papa's pipe. The child's face is full of expression, and is as pretty a picture of baby's life as was ever made for a moving picture machine. Sure to delight the children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015089</url></doc>
