<plot>In a stark, black-and-white, computer-animated world, identical men resembling woodcuts march in perfect unison down the street. The procession is formed by men coming out of buildings and by men with open umbrellas dropping from the sky. They are dressed identically, in the same coats and the same tall hats. But one man, to his horror, suddenly becomes different. He loses his hat in a revolving door. Now his head is naked. He is different. Some of the other men stop their marching to turn to him and point. The man escapes them by running on top of the procession, on top of the heads of every other man. Soon, he is in front of a tall statue, desperately trying to remove its hat and take it for his own. Eventually, the man finds there is only one way to become like everyone else again: remove the hat of some other man and make him the one who is different.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?325979</url></doc>
