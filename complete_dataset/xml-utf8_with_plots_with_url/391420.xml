<plot>This scene takes place in Genoa, Italy, and shows the Italian boatmen indulging in one of their most exciting sports, entitled "Water Jousting." The sailors imitate the Knights of old who rode full speed at each other mounted on horseback, each rider endeavoring to unseat his antagonist by means of a long lance, or spear; however, in this case, instead of being mounted on horses, the sturdy boatmen stand on their boats with feet planted wide apart, holding in their hands a long stick with a pad on the end. As the boats are rowed past each other by their crews, the combatants endeavor to overthrow their opponents, and the loser is invariably toppled off backwards with a huge splash into the water. The photographic quality of this subject is all that can be desired and the action very amusing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391420</url></doc>
