<plot>Keith Robinson is in the fight of his life. It is a fight on two fronts. The first is a battle to protect the privacy of his remote Hawaiian island of Ni'ihau, known to locals as the Forbidden Island. Robinson's family purchased the island paradise for $10,000 in gold in 1864. It remains home for 200 native Hawaiians who are largely cut off from the outside world. Robinson has spent millions of his own money to preserve his family's empire but funds are running out. How will he survive? The second and more contentious fight involves how to best preserve some of the world's rarest plants. Robinson has been credited with significant botanical successes, yet he is threatening "scorched earth" tactics to destroy his years of research as a bitter showdown with the US government escalates. Who will win? What will happen to the plants without him?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465639</url></doc>
