<plot>The Name is Rogells (Rugg-ells) is a quirky off beat tale about a directionless, new age artist stuck in her dead end job. Kitty Rogells (Rugg-ells), 30 shuffles through life depressed until she runs into her grade school crush Will Fishborne, 30. Together they steal off from a gas station, run from the cops, and get lost in the remote Florida woodlands. It's a wild ride when they finally reach his mystical haunts off the 'beaten path'. The story opens in darkened a classroom: 'An Alternate Reality' Kitty sits among the students as her life unfolds on the projector screen above. Here in this cosmic classroom she meets her spirit guide Nigal. There the students learn the same lessons: trust, shame, compassion... This is the human experience. Traveling with Will, Kitty plunges into a deep sleep state, there a frightening purgatorial realm awaits her. Their mission is to locate and cross the bridge of illusion that few have ever seen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578418</url></doc>
