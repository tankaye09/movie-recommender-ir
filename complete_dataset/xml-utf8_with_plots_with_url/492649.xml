<plot>Shift is an animated short film structured like an experiential journey without characters. It is inspired by films like Baraka and Koyaanisqatsi. The story is told through the use of environment, atmosphere and the camera. The central theme is a different take on cycles through time, (i.e. moving from destruction, to reclamation and rejuvenation,) and one of the major goals is to get the audience to slow down and examine something carefully, whether it is a subtly moving image or a cyclical, undulating motion. Production methods are similar to those used in 3D matte paintings and include watercolor painting, projection of 2D images onto 3D elements, and compositing effects applied in post. These disparate media are blended to create a seamless voyage through place and time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?492649</url></doc>
