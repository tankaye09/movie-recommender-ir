<plot>A story about a tagging crew (graffiti artists) in Downtown L.A. that connect with an accomplished photographer. They learn about each other's culture and that they are ultimately searching for the same thing: to 'find one's own canvas' in life and to leave their mark on the world. The photographer must ultimately decide what to do with incriminating pictures that he has taken of the crew. They are the path to the future of his career, but also evidence against his newfound friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282702</url></doc>
