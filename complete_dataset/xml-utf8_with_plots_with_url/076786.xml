<plot>Boyfriend drives his fianc√©, Macy, to their old make-out point. Just as they start to kiss, a noise is heard at the back of the car. A man is taunting them from outside. Boyfriend gets out to "make him pay" for the damage he was doing to his car, but he is stabbed and killed. Macy panics and locks the car. She then puts the car into reverse and begins to drive to safety when she suddenly backs over the set PA, killing him. The entire crew runs out to see the PA, exposing the reality show spoof. Boyfriend then explains to Macy that he had set her up for make money for their wedding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076786</url></doc>
