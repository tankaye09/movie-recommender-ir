<plot>Dance Complex puts the spotlight on one building that unites a diverse population through the love of dance. The dancers that we meet in Dance Complex face injuries, multiple jobs, lack health care, and dwindling funding. Blossoming out of these challenges is a vital group of teachers, performers and students. Set in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dance Complex documents how this volunteer-based arts organization includes and inspires every age, gender, race and economic group. Held together by a historic building and their mutual love of dance, a community has come together. Dance Complex witnesses dance as a common language that cannot be silenced.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125377</url></doc>
