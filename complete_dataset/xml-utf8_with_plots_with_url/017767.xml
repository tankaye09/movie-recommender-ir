<plot>Two youngsters who are shooting at birds with sling-shots break the front window of a house and run away. An old gentleman happening along picks up the sling-shot and stops to examine it. As he does the owner of the house appears, and after accusing the old gentleman of inflicting the damage calls the police and has him carried away, protesting against the indignity. Very well done.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017767</url></doc>
