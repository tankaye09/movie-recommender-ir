<plot>Based on the ill-fated love story of Laila and Majnu, this version shows them as inseparable childhood sweethearts, and subsequently as each others lovers. They want to get married, but as their fathers' (Emir E Basra, and Emir E Yemen respectively) are sworn enemies of each other, they are not permitted to see other, leave alone get married. Separated from each other, they long and pine for each other. Kais (Majnu's real name) has forsaken everything and roams the streets with a beggars bowl, looking all over for his Laila. He finds her and their romance is rekindled. The authorities find Kais' longing for Laila unusual as he values her love above that of Allah, he is declared insane, and people are encouraged to stone him to death. He survives and Kais' dad and mom fall at the feet of Laila's dad and beg him to permit this marriage = he reluctantly agrees - on the condition that Kais undergo a test to prove that he is not insane. Kais fails in the test, and Laila's marriage is arranged with Shehzada Ingne Salaam, who has offered Emir E Basra enough wealth to last them for centuries and generations to come. Will Laila give her consent for this marriage? What will Kais do under these circumstances?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345141</url></doc>
