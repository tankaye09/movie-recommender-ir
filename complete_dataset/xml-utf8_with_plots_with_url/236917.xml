<plot>Fantasy RPG: Ever since the GodSlayer sword was used to destroy the God of the Land, religion has been outlawed and the "Inquisitors" tasked with keeping it taboo. In the years following, the GodSlayer sword was used by the descendants of the man who slew the God of the Land to control the world. Through sacrifices meant to appease the sword's blood lust, the descendants worked to rule through tyranny. Finally, these descendants were defeated and the sword held in safe-keeping by monks. The hero is marked with a God Symbol (a mark some people have from birth that marks them as possibly able to become a mage) and is sent to destroy the GodSlayer sword, but when you arrive, it has been stolen. So begins your journey, to capture and destroy the sword.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236917</url></doc>
