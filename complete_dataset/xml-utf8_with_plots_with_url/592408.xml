<plot>Superheroes is set in New York City and centers around a 13 year old from Brooklyn (Sammer) who occasionally travels into Manhattan with friends to steal video cameras from tourists. Sammer is a slightly quirky, fantasy prone teenager who lives alone with his blind foster mother and has plans to leave the city. As soon as he can save enough money, be released from probation and help his foster mother to regain her failing vision, Sammer intends to travel to far away lands and explore the world, a world he sees primarily through the stolen videotapes of tourists. As we learn about Sammer and his working class neighborhood, we are introduced to other characters who weave in and out of his life, characters that include: a juvenile probation officer who doesn't like juveniles, an ex-con who steals puppies and a street prophet who's trying to commit suicide. Superheroes is a quirky story about many people and many things, incorporating a fragmented narrative, found footage and other people's home video footage. It's the story of ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances, blurring the line between being human and being superhuman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592408</url></doc>
