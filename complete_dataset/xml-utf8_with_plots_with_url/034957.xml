<plot>Art Sinsabaugh made his artistic breakthrough in the early 1960s with panoramic landscapes of the Midwest that were unprecedented in both form and subject matter. Trained at Chicago's Institute of Design, Sinsabaugh was a landscape photographer who photographed the spaces that people inhabit. From his early prairies to the majestic work of his last years, his remarkable photographs capture the ever-changing face of the American environment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034957</url></doc>
