<plot>Scouring the obituaries so they can sweet-talk widows into selling their houses cheap; is there anything lower? Just the hole they're digging for themselves. Lowballers is the story of Gil, a sleazy real estate grifter and his young and naive con-artist-in training. Gil is teaching his protege a scam where Gil uses the little amount of charm he possesses to scam little old widows into selling their 'big, empty houses' to him for below the going rate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346135</url></doc>
