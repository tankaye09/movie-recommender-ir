<plot>Imagine a world where God has fled his kingdom and Heaven is an armed celestial camp. A world where the forces of Hell grow stronger every day and the earthly bastions of good are being held by homeless children - outcasts shunned by society and left to face this horror alone. Imagine what you would do if you were one of those children. First-time filmmakers Kat Alix-Gaudreau and J. Elizabeth Martin bring you the short horror film "Bloody Mary." Morgan James (Lindsey Bellock) returns to the children's shelter where she was raised, only to discover that the nightmare she left behind in her childhood has returned. A demon stalks the halls of the St. Francis Home for Children, and the only defense the girls have against the fiend is an angel called the Blue Lady. But the Blue Lady is missing and time is running out. In a chilling battle against evil, Morgan must attempt to save the children of St. Francis from Bloody Mary, and discover what dark forces have summoned the demon that Satan himself fears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075861</url></doc>
