<plot>This subject is the most magnificent panoramic view taken in the Canadian "Rockies." The entire picture is of a stereoscopic quality which has excited the most enthusiastic praise wherever shown. The scenery is the most magnificent on the North American continent. Innumerable short tunnels are shown, and the view, taken from the front of a train running at high speed, is one that even tourists riding over the line are not privileged to enjoy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430957</url></doc>
