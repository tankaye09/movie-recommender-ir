<plot>JOHN FISHER is a closeted artist in a loveless relationship. He creates and films a project about butterflies and their environment, everything made completely of paper. While watching his creation on the television, a woman appears that he did not film. She is stunningly beautiful. As he tries to discover her mysteries, no one believes him. His best friend thinks he is crazy and his girlfriend is beginning to suspect that he is as well. Future scenes about his relationship with the filmed woman are interspersed throughout the movie as John's current life plays forward. He begins to become more artistic and freely thinks of the filmed girl as the film goes on. As his current, loveless relationship ends, he finds the filmed woman and it all starts from there.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546858</url></doc>
