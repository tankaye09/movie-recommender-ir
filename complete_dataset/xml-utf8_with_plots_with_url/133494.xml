<plot>Deadroom centers around four encounters, each confined to a single room. A man helps a young woman remember her past. A husband and wife confront each other about their infidelities. A journalist interviews a famous author about the mysteries hidden in his novel. A secretary visits her former employer to tell him how much she's always loved him. Each of these conversations could happen any day, every day -- except that the young woman has been raped and murdered, the husband has died in a terrible automobile accident, the employer has perished in afire, and the novelist has passed away from old age. The four intertwined stories weave a tale that is shocking, humorous, tragic and uplifting. In Deadroom, secrets are shared, truths are revealed, and each of the eight characters comes to an understanding they could not have gained without the touch of death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133494</url></doc>
