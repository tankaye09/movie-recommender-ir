<plot>In order to improve their lifestyle, Lucknow based Ghulam Hussain decides to re-locate to Bombay, leaving his ailing mother and wife, Khairun, behind. He arrives in Bombay, and looks up his close friend, Lalulal Tiwari, who gets him a job cleaning taxis. Ghulam subsequently learns how to drive, and is hired to drive a taxi. Despite of his best efforts he is unable to save enough money to visit Lucknow. Lalulal has problems of his own, despite of being settled in Bombay for several years; having a sweetheart, Yashodra, he is unable to even rent a decent apartment, and lives in a shanty tenement, which is slated to be demolished by the Bombay Municipal Corporation. Will Lalulal and Ghulam be able to improve their lives or will they be caught up in just surviving on a day to day basis?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209088</url></doc>
