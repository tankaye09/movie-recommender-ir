<plot>Act Your Age tells the story of a family that gets mixed up in some very weird magic. Grandma Rose's Magic Festival, an anuual community event in Elinbrook, is interrupted when the 2,000 year-old witch Marcelan and her ex-husband, Frederique the Evil Freak, turn the festivities upside down. She is trying to hide from him what he wants most: the Book of Bagasius, an ancient book of powerful spells. When it fals into the wrong hands seniors start turning into kids and kids into seniors. Grandpa Harry transforms into a 10 year-old boy while his granddaughter Patty becomes a 76 year-old woman! The trouble is if the Book of Bagasius falls into Frederique's diabolical hands, he will have the power to dominate the universe. Of course, the parents are all too busy doing errands to notice anything unusual going on so old and young must work together to find the magic book before it's too late. Act Your Age is a collaboration between professional filmmakers and amateur children and seniors. The process of making a movie allowed these two badly divided generations to get to know each other and learn from each other in ways that are not possible in everyday life. The joyful spirit of this collaboration comes across in the movie as a behind the scenes documentary explaining how the movie was made weaves through the narrative.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022709</url></doc>
