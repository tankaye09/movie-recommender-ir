<plot>Twenty years earlier, William Chambers was driving drunk. Without the full use of his senses, William ran off the road. He was found by two police officers Fox and Keys. Once Officer Fox realized that he was staring down the face of Mayor Chambers's son William, he immediately let William off with a warning, knowing he was under the influence. After William drives off into the dawn, Officer Keys securing the area finds an unidentified woman several yards away. She was bleeding from the mouth and her leg had been amputated. After screaming for Fox to call for help and question the driver who apparently hit this woman, Officer Keys discovers that Fox let him go. Now both cops are facing a lot of trouble, Fox decides to call the chief and the Mayor to authorize a cover-up. The woman dies on the way to the hospital.
