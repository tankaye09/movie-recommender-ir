<plot>When Elizabeth Short came to Hollywood she was not unlike thousands of other young women, hoping her good looks and a little bit of talent would propel her into the world of the rich and famous. Elizabeth Short did earn notoriety, but in a horrifying way that would come to chill even the most seasoned investigators. Within weeks of her murder, 37 innocent men and women had confessed to the crime. What is it that fascinates us so about the Black Dahlia? What was the dark secret that police kept under lock and key for over half a century? And what kind of person could have committed such a violent, brutal, yet carefully planned and executed crime? Crime writer Joseph Wambaugh picks up his pen and goes back on the beat with the mysterious case of the Black Dahlia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095804</url></doc>
