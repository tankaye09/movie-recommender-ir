<plot>Lift documents the lifestyle of acrobatic paragliders Tim and Anthony Green, also known as the Acrotwins, and their adventures from the US to Europe. After years of other athletic pursuits the twins took up paragliding as an extreme sport at age 16 and are entirely self taught. The twins learned to fly on a golf course with a used parachute, a WWII harness and a golf cart. Moving to Chamonix, France, two years later, they began entering - and winning - local and international competitions. Described by the authors as a documentary about "our unique sport, worldwide travels and extreme antics", the film includes footage of daring stunts: Anthony climbing and flying off of a construction crane in Paris, Tim jumping off of the Foresthill bridge, the third highest bridge in the U.S., and a 'D-bag' (where the pilot drops off a paramotor or helicopter). Many aspects of the sport that are rarely seen, including flight preparations, interviews and insights from participants.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336103</url></doc>
