<plot>A lonely 10-year-old boy discovers a miniature shipwreck on an isolated beach and is shocked to find dozens of tiny footprints leading away from the historic sailing vessel, evidence of a curious disembarking. The boy follows the prints, uncovering tiny artifacts left behind by the crew along the way. Clue by clue, he pieces together the most amazing of stories. With the intrusion of his mother who arrives to collect him, his journey is halted and his world dashed when he finds all is not as it seems. Or is it? Shipwrecked is a tale of imagination, intrigue, and the childhood capacity for embracing the remarkable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?493395</url></doc>
