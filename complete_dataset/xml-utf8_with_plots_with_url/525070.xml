<plot>Among the rich and famous are also the infamous. One of Interpol's top targets has his own scheme brewing. Since he is too clever to be caught, the cops send a thief to catch a thief. Carlotta is blackmailed into helping them bring down the international crime boss, or go to prison for her scams. Ever practical, Carlotta agrees to go along, but the cops don't know how far they can trust her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525070</url></doc>
