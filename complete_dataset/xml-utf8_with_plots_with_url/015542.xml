<plot>An accomplished, Brooklyn based musician wrestles with daily existence, navigating his artistic path and reconciling 30 years of fractured roots in the deep south. Walter Baker is an eccentric musician grappling to find his creative voice in NYC. Artistically and philosophically straddling the lines between the fringes and mainstream culture, Baker wrestles to bear the roles of family man, business owner and aspiring singer-songwriter. An unexpected trip to Texas for a family gathering triggers deeper conflicts that prove to be far reaching.
