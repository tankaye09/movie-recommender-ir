<plot>This film was obtained after a great outlay of time and money and shows the ice-bound Yukon River in the Alaska gold mining regions of which so much has been written in the past two years. The picture also shows a steamer trying to plow its way through the ice giving the much-talked of smoke effect which enhances the value of the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071748</url></doc>
