<plot>Narrated by Corey Burton, this made-for-video documentary treats animation and classic film fans to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Disney's 1937 picture, Snow White. Features archive footage of Disney and his teams of voice actors and animators as they worked on this project that many had said was doomed to failure, but instead became a favorite of millions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503502</url></doc>
