<plot>This important documentary begins when filmmaker Laurel Greenberg watches some home movies that her father shot of his mother in a nursing home in Philadelphia. "Do you like it here?" Marvin asks his mother Belle. Her weak smile and feigned enthusiasm seem to satisfy Marvin, yet are disturbing to Laurel, who sets out to uncover her grandmother's true feelings. An immigrant from Russia, Belle Greenberg built her life around caring for her family. How did she come to be alone and isolated from this family at the end of her life? Through intimate scenes with her father and grandmother, Greenberg depicts the struggle to balance personal needs with familial responsibility, the fragmenting of families across the country, and the difficult evolution of the caretaker parent to dependent elder.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007189</url></doc>
