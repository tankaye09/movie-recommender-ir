<plot>During a nighttime trip in the family car, the Angry Kid is in the back seat as one of his parents drives. Country and western music plays on the radio; headlights play across the night, illuminating the Kid from time to time. He makes faces. Eventually, he's bored and disappears from sight. As headlights come and go, we see the empty back seat and then we see the Kid desperately clinging to the back window of the car, having somehow gotten outside. He slips slowly out of sight, and a truck rumbles into view. Is this the end of the Kid?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232918</url></doc>
