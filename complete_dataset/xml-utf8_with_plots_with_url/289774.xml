<plot>When Cliff Burns' book RIGHTEOUS BLOOD was released in 2003, it quickly earned a cult-like reputation thanks to the two powerful and distinctive novellas the book contained. Reviewers praised its no-holds-bar approach to its subject matter and singled out "Kept" as a compelling and terrifying thrill ride. "Kept" shows the influence of David Cronenberg and Roman Polanski; indeed, the movie (now in pre-production) has been described as "Fatal Attraction" meets "The Tenant". The people who share space in the apartment building at the center of the film will remain with you for a long time. And the building's caretaker, part Ninja, part berserker, is the scariest and most compelling heroic villain to come along since Hannibal Lector. Sure to be a visual and cerebral horrorfest from the people who brought you the "Saw" films.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?289774</url></doc>
