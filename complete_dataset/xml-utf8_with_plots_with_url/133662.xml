<plot>The story of two fourteen year old girls, Ellie and Max the Wax, who travel across America in 1962 during the chaos of the Cuban missile crisis in search of Eleanor Roosevelt and Ellie's late mother. Their secret journey begins in their hometown of Manteca, California (The Pumpkin Capital of the World). Their final destination: New York City (The Big Apple). Along the way they're robbed by a guy who looks like Warren Beatty and helped out by Max's Aunt Daisy, a vaudevillian contortionist who can fold herself into a bag. When Ellie loses all hope of ever finding her mother, Aunt Daisy pushes her onward to discover just what is waiting for her at Eleanor Roosevelt's house, and why this advent will not be the end of her journey, but just the beginning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133662</url></doc>
