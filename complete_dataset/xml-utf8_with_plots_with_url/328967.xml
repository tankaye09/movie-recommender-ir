<plot>Are you a smooth, suave, single guy on the make, or maybe you fancy yourself the sleek, sexy femme fatale? Whoever you are, get ready for a look at the other side of life. In this game, you're both! Leisure Suit Larry III is the first Sierra game ever to allow you to switch roles and see the story from another point of view. As Larry, you'll get dumped by your woman and lose your job at Natives, Inc. What better reason to take off into the steamy jungle ruled by Amazon cannibal women? As Patti, you'll follow Larry's trail deep into the overgrown jungle of Nontoonyt Island. Find your lover, and rescue him from a life of sex slavery at the hands of the man-eating cannibal Amazon women who have taken him prisoner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328967</url></doc>
