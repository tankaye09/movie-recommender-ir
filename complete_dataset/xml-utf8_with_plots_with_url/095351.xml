<plot>A beautiful subject, showing the clergyman carrying the regalia used in the coronation of King Edward and Queen Alexandra, into Westminster Abbey. Taken in the Dean's yard of the Abbey on the morning of the coronation. The picture is opened by the passing of the choir boys and assistant clergymen, bearing the cross which was presented by Ras Makonnon, the sceptres and the Queen's crown; the Bible borne by the Bishop of London, who was closely followed by Canon Duckworth, who carries St. Edward's crown. A most beautiful and perfect picture, presenting the above notables in full life size.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095351</url></doc>
