<plot>One redeeming factor about PRC was their ability to be topical and responsive to "late breaking news" and "this just in" situations, whether it applied or not. Easy to do when making films in seven days or less and the time from start-of-production to release of film was often less a month. An example is in this film when they were able to add just-released US government shots of the Atomic bomb test in New Mexico to this film after it was finished. Never mind that the word Atomic Bomb was never used in this film. This one finds Richard Fraser being thrown from a train, after his papers are stolen, on which he was bound for Washington to present the government his own secret bomb formula. He is found by rancher Grace Gillern and nursed back to help but is suffering from amnesia. Cy Kendall and his henchies trace him to the ranch and drop by since a vital part of his formula was missing from the papers they had stolen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?489775</url></doc>
