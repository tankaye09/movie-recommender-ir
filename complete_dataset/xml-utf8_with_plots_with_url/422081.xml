<plot>This charming piece of scenery was taken at GLenochole and Golden, which is the commencing point of the picturesque part of the Ottertail Group of mountains on the Canadian Pacific Railroad. In the distance we see the huge mountains towering thousands of feet above the railroad tracks, the peaks of the mountains being covered with snow. The picture being taken from the front of an engine while the train is running a distance of several miles give an excellent view of this beautiful section of the country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422081</url></doc>
