<plot>In Saint-Hyacinthe, a little town in Quebec, Jeannot Caron is considered to be a crazy man. However, he has a dream. He wishes to build the first love hospital in the world for people in needs. With the wood he collected on the banks of the Yamaska river, he is making a raft that will become the future hospital. But the city wants to maintain public order. The authorities will not allow such an ambitious project and are putting pressure on Jeannot to vacate the premises where he is trying to establish himself. Jeannot won't give up his dreams despite the problems that lay ahead. His reasons will encourage him to continue his project until the end no matter how hard the task. The hope and the passion of the selfless man will never die. The movie, Jeannot Le Fou, portrays a marginal humanist who's mission is to help all the unfortunate people in the world by curing them with love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274988</url></doc>
