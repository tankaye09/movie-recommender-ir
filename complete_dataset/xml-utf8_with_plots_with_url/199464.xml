<plot>A sports short, kicking off the 1950 college-football season, featuring Kyle Rote,the All-America football player of the Southern Methodist University Mustangs from Dallas. In the last game of the 1949 season, the vastly-underdog Mustangs, minus the services of their injured 1948 Hesiman Trophy winner, Doak Walker, came close to beating the undefeated Fighting Irish of Notre Dame in a 27-20 loss, thanks primarily to the exploits of Kyle Rote. The latter made the 1950 All-American team and went on to a stellar career playing for the professional New York Giants, before going on to a career as an acclaimed network sportscaster.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199464</url></doc>
