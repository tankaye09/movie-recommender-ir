<plot>MGR is the richest man in Tamil Nadu (!), Seeking an escape from his busy life, he takes off to his sprawling property in the hills, only to find that his home is being rented out as a hotel by his manager's crooked son-in-law (Nagesh). Disguising himself as a guest, he pays nightly charges to stay at his own home to woo sassy socialite (Saroja Devi). A classic MGR with the usual colourful sets, grand songs, and boisterous one-liners. Super timepass, as they say.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038843</url></doc>
