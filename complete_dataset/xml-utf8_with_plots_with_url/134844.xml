<plot>Has your conscience followed you in a more recent situation? Have you been circled with echoes of crisis? Caught amidst depression in a world of addictions one young man explores the truth that goodness &amp; peace or bad &amp; evil comes from within us and can be only restored inside out. The film shares the insights of the distressed man found through conversations with his conscience and takes us on a whispering journey of self-discovery. DEEP INSIDE is a powerful real life story which urges people to uncover their dark areas and return to self where true love, peace and joy resides. It also gives a fascinating glimpse into the plight of planet earth, a unique search that challenges us to think about not only our relationship with the beings around us but also with our inner self.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134844</url></doc>
