Victor Moore, successful lawyer, enjoying his Florida retirement with his beautiful second wife, Melody are swimming happily in his glass bottom bottle of alcohol. Visited by his estranged son, Danny, a now successful NYC photographer and a six month AA member, the two men need to separate their addictions from their true feelings. When hospitalized for a fatal bleeding ulcer, Victor confronts his worst fear, betrayal by the two people he loves the most.
