<plot>Quick Draw Mcgraw was a dimwitted and lanky mustang (horse) who caused much chaos in the Old West. If he could get his own six shooter out of his holster at all, he would usually shoot the wrong man. His partner, a Mexican burro name Baba Looie, was always trying to help Quick Draw as much as he could. Also on the show were cartoons featuring Snooper and Blabber, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?451996</url></doc>
