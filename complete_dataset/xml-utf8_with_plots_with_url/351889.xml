<plot>The second in a series of documentaries about chamber music, Magic Violin looks at the life of Antonio Vivaldi and paints a portrait of Venice, the city where he spent most of his life. Featuring original choreography by Danielle Tardiff, the film is structured around two of Vivaldi's works: the Concerto for Oboe in C major and the Concerto for two violins in D minor, both performed by I Musici de Montréal. Several documentary sequences, which focus on various aspects of Vivaldi's life, alternate with a series of imaginative tableaux corresponding to each movement of the two concertos. The rich visual style of these segments inspired by Vivaldi's music evokes the opulent and fascinating period of Venetian history during which the composer flourished.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351889</url></doc>
