<plot>Attractive Leela has three suitors. The first one is Shyam, an artistic painter, who offers her his heart, and a room he shares with his friend, Chamanlal. While the trio are busy conning others, Leela meets with Sita, who is a Rani of a region, she takes a fancy to Leela, invites her to her palace, introduces her to her son, Kumar, who instantly falls in love with her. When Leela indicates that she loves Shyam, Kumar and his mom conspire to be friendly with Shyam, help him put up his paintings in his very own art gallery, so as to win over Leela. Before Leela could make up her mind, she is abducted by her third suitor, a hoodlum by the name of Bhagwan - who has no intentions whatsoever of releasing Leela for any amount of ransom, and wants to make her his at any cost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020585</url></doc>
