<plot>Felix tries to get into a snooty nightclub, and is told that only people of "unquestioned lineage" are allowed in. Felix then relates his family history, including how his ancestors taught the Egyptian pharaohs how to do the Charleston and another one who showed Columbus that the world was round. In the end, Felix brings his family tree--literally--into the club to prove his lineage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427403</url></doc>
