<plot>Follow the cast and crew behind the scenes as they talk about their roles in the Showtime Directorial Premiere of Rockmond Dunbar's "The Great Commission". Key moment, Rockmond Dunbar speaks about the Space Shuttle Columbia explosion that had occurred the day before. Rockmond gives a spontaneous and unforgettable tribute while the cast and crew listens. Mr. Dunbar was so moved to speak he just did it, and only by sheer good luck was the camera person there to get this priceless moment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063911</url></doc>
