<plot>An Alien (Powka) from an unknown place crash lands on Earth. His space ship is the size of a dice and the on board computer is now broken. He meets two children who, through a series of adventures, teach him and his computer Maths in an effort to fix his space ship so he can get 'home'. To get into the space ship they say 'Tikki Tikki Tox, Into the Box' and vice versa to get out. At the end of each show the computer sings a song to show understanding of what it has been taught.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360994</url></doc>
