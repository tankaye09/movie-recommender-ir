<plot>It's been said that America has given the world two thoroughly original art forms... jazz and the movie musical. The 1930s saw the newly born genre of the Hollywood musical bloom with artistry and variety never before imagined. For many film-goers, the Hollywood musical gave them escape and hope during the troubled years of the Great Depression. Highlights of this 2-part program include the magic of director/choreographer Busby Berkeley as his eye-popping, sexy production numbers move to the forefront of the genre. The screen partnership of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers brings sizzling romance to the screen. The style and grace of these perfect partners was unprecedented. Musical child stars brighten the doldrums of the depression. The musical ladies of 20th-Century Fox are profiled, as well as the dancers that tapped their way into America's hearts. Singing cowboys burst upon the scene creating an entirely new genre, the musical western and many songs and musicals are featured in this Musical history of the 1930s.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243403</url></doc>
