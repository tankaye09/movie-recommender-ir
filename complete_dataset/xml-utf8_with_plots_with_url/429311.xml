<plot>Trekking through African jungles, explorer Rod Bedford and his companion, Joe Marks, are captured by a wild cannibal tribe. Kimpo, a young white boy, whose presence in the jungle is as mysterious as his immunity from the savages is strange, rescues them. The natives hold the boy in superstitious fear. Later, Bedford and Marks come to the camp of Alexander Marley, an archaeologist, who is blinded with fever and is tended by his daughter, Phyllis, and a man named "Brute" Hanley, who has been shipwrecked with them on the African coast. Marley has come to Africa seeking his other daughter, Helen, and her young son, who have been taken captive through the perfidy of a trusted aide to Helen's husband, another scientist. Marley dies but gives Phyllis and Bedford each half a map which will help them locate the savage Bougagou tribe, known as the "tiger men" and who have a great treasure. Hanley tries to steal the map and also has plans to kidnap Phyllis, whose beauty has roused his bestial nature. He enlists the aid of Bart Stevens, Bedford's guide and sinister in his own right, and of Renee, a slave trader. Phyllis and Bedford finally find Kimpo and through him locate the Bougagous country, which are ruled by a half-mad white woman. Hanley, meanwhile, has gathered a gang of henchies from the slaver-trader's motley crew, and is laying plans to take the Bougagous treasure. Bedford and Hanley's parties arrive at the same time at a gruesome cave, where the Bougagous hold their weird, tigerish orgies among the one-eyed idols of a past civilization. Here they find the mysterious white-witch woman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429311</url></doc>
