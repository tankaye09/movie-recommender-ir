<plot>This is the first motion picture of its kind ever attempted. It shows the wood choppers felling enormous trees. As each tree falls, it is seen to carry with it all the small trees and many branches of the taller ones. After the trees are cut down they are hauled to the river by dummy engines. A chute of heavy logs is built from a point high up on the banks of the river to a distance of about thirty feet out in the water, and the trees after being trimmed and cut into great logs, are shot down the chutes into the water, where they are coupled together and floated down stream to a landing place near the saw mills. As the logs strike the water when leaving the chutes, they throw the spray high in the air, presenting a beautiful effect in the picture. The landing place above referred to is next shown. Here is another chute up which the logs are hauled and loaded on cars especially constructed for this work. The next and last scene shows a train load of logs being hauled to the saw mill. An excellent piece of photography and a very instructive subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479974</url></doc>
