<plot>Two and a half years after their breakup, and two months after 9/11, the Bogmen joined together for two nights in December, 2001 at NYC's Irving Plaza. It was to support the charity Secret Smiles, founded by Kristy Irvine Ryan (wife of Bogmen keyboardist Brendan). Kristy was lost in the collapse of the World Trade Center, as were loved ones of many of those in attendance on these two very special nights in December.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077865</url></doc>
