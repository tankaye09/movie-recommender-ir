<plot>In the original version of "Treasure Hunt" (a daily series which aired on ABC and later, NBC) two contestants, one a champion, answer up to four general knowledge questions as selected by their opponent. The winner got to go on a treasure hunt. On the stage were 30 numbered treasure chests some small, some invitingly large. Each treasure chest had a cash amount between $500 to $3,000 plus a mystery prize. The contestant could pocket the cash or give it back for whatever was in the box. It could be anything from a worthless nonsense prize (e.g., a head of cabbage) to cars, trips, furs, jewelry, furniture sets, appliances ... to a check worth $25,000 (or $10,000 plus $1,000 for each show unclaimed on the primetime show). After the contestant had made his/her decision, Murray then showed him/her what they had won (or in some cases, could have won). Either way, the contestant returned and competed until he/she lost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617000</url></doc>
