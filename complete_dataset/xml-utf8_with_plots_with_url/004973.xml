<plot>Jason Conrad was looking forward to spending the summer at space camp. But his parent have to go on a trip, so he and his twin sister Michelle have to spend the summer at Grandmum's cottage. Just when Jason thinks he's in for the worst summer ever, he finds a toy space ship and four out of this world penguins-Zidgel, Midgel, Fidgel, and Kevin-in the attic. Suddenly he's in for one great adventure. Jason and the penguins travel to Planet Wait-Your-Turn where we learn the importance of patience and that "having to go first all the time only leads to trouble".</plot><plot>Jason Conrad was looking forward to spending the summer at space camp.
