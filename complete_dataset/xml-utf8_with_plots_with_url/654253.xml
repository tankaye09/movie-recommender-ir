<plot>Five guys, connected by both the building they live in and an insatiable thirst for sports, games and fun get together whenever possible, like every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and most weekends, and any other day their wives or girlfriends will let them out of the house. When they do meet up, it's the ultimate men's think-tank, where dealing with the women in their lives is usually the number one topic. Ed, mid fifties is a mentor and father figure, especially to Vince who is young and naive in the ways of the world. Vince meets someone he thinks could be the woman of his dreams. It becomes Ed's mission to stop not only Vince but also the other guys in his boys club from being sucked into the vortex of marriage. He feels the guys need to do some living first before losing their freedom. Ed has a list of dating and relationship rules which all the guys live by. But when a man falls in love, obviously rules go out the window. That leaves our boys' club (Ed, Vince, Antonio, Sean and Cal) at odds and in big trouble!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654253</url></doc>
