<plot>This documentary is about the building of the memorial to St. Cyril and St. Methodius in the center of the city of Pazardzhik, Bulgaria. A conversation with the monument's author - sculptor Spas Kirichev reveals the realization of the project, which for the first time in Bulgaria depicts the two Slavonic en-lighteners as saints with nimbus. Various stages of the creation of the sculpture are traced. Opinions of the citizens and the members of fellowship 'Earliest Teachers', which raises funds from natural and juridical persons are included.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424730</url></doc>
