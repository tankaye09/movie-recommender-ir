<plot>Rekha is the typical artsy/boho Toronto hipster, who's the singer/bassist for a heavy metal band. But is she as liberal as she looks? Amit is a simply dressed jazz and hard rock lover who came to Canada when he was eleven. But is he as conservative as he looks? The second film in the Exterior trilogy, which explores how race, ethnicity and faith drive a wedge between people. Hatred portrays the Hindu/Muslim conflict within the South Asian community in contemporary Canadian society, and presents South Asians in a manner that dodges cliches and stereotypes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185984</url></doc>
