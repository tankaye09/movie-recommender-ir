<plot>Mrs. Jones instructs her spouse to attend to the baby while she goes to market. Jones tries to amuse his offspring but does not succeed. Suddenly he thinks of the bottle which is standing on a shelf outside of the window to cool. Bringing it in he hastens to feed its contents to the baby who devours it. Thinking the child needs further amusement, he dances it on his knee, when the child vomits the milk into Jones' face. Enraged, he spanks it just as his wife enters. She takes the baby away, and after laying it down, proceed to give her hubby a good drubbing with the broom. Comical.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655783</url></doc>
