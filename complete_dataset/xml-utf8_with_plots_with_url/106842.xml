<plot>Leo finds himself in a steady situation of desperation and uncertainty. Is he dreaming? He chases a guy that has his backpack, but every time he faces him, Leo falls asleep. Every time he wakes up, he reappears in a different location, and the guy with the backpack is in front of him, so he gets up and chases him again. Leo shoots himself 3 times, and each time he comes back to life, Donna is next to Leo watching him. Donna seems to be so understanding of the situation. At the end she explains to Leo that he is dead and that he has to let go his past and let his soul be free.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106842</url></doc>
