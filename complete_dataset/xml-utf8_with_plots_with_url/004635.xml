<plot>Mike Lesley and Jeff Smith are turning 30 and believe their care-free days are about to be over. Mike is the likeable slacker of the two. He is a substitute teacher who works well with kids, but would rather live on the golf course than be working. This infuriates his scheming long-time girlfriend, Cathy, and his banker father, Jack. They both want Mike to become a banker at Jack's office. Cathy's anger at Mike's inability to commit to the job drives her into another man's bed in an act of spite. Finding her in "the act" shocks Mike into a life crisis he's never faced before. In stark contrast to Mike is his high-strung friend, Jeff, who is a conservative pharmaceutical representative whose traditional nature finds him struggling with the values of modern society. Jeff is afraid of commitment and is unable to find the one thing he needs most, love, until Michelle, a beautiful nurse, walks into a coffee shop and into his life. Michelle is everything he has been looking for until, suddenly, his estranged father dies. The memories of his past float to the surface and Jeff spirals out of control until he must let go of what's holding him back or come to grips with the chance of losing Michelle forever.In the end, both characters find the truth of their lives and the strength to go after what they want, no matter what the risks of failure may bring. This light-hearted but realistic story will leave everyone saying "I remember those times!"</plot><plot>Mike Lesley and Jeff Smith are turning 30 and believe their care-free days are about to be over.
