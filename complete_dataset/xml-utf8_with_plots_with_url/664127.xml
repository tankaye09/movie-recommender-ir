<plot>As the birth of their first child approaches and apartment space is lacking, the filmmaker and his wife struggle with attachment to seemingly trivial but sentimental possessions. Soon they question how best to preserve family history--do these everyday objects carry as much importance as home movies and other family relics? It's with this in mind that Brad Barber navigates the eclectic and sometimes bizarre collage of family heirlooms on display at yard sales, asking the sellers and patrons how they decide what to get rid of and what must be preserved. On the eve of their baby's new life, what results is a personal look at the nature of attachment, family history, and an intriguing attempt at discovering what's really worth holding on to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664127</url></doc>
