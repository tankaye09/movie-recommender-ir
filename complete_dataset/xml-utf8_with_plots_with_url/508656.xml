<plot>As part of a personal artistic statement about Canada, writer Douglas Coupland, takes an old house of vintage Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation design to remodel it into a personal statement of Canadiana. While we see him at work, Coupland tells the story of his life as a youth in Vancouver who became a author who would define a Generation as "X." More importantly, Coupland also gives his take on the various aspects that mark his country's identity such as Distance, French, Terry Fox, Toronto, the Wild and many more. Taken together, Coupland seeks to explain what Canada is with all its beauty and flaws as only a Canadian can do.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?508656</url></doc>
