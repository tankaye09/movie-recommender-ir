<plot>Clean up your act. Make a difference. Plan your Escape. Fresh out of juvie, Brian is back on the street with nowhere to go. An ominous future looms before him; he can go straight or go to prison as an adult. Clarissa, his runaway girlfriend, dreams of a better life for the two of them, but she doesn't know how to make it a reality. Brian's best friend, Mo B, is a pusher and a prophet who sees only two ways out of this life: locked up in prison or zipped up in a body bag. Only John, Brian's social worker, pushes Brian to make a decision about the rest of his life, even as his own future spirals into chaos and self-destruction. But just as Brian begins to change it all, he discovers that fate has other plans. Bad Habits is both a tragic love story and an urban cautionary tale, charting a single day in the lives of four people lost at the crossroads -- and the virtues and vices that shape them. You have one day to change your life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055946</url></doc>
