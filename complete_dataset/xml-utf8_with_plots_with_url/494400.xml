<plot>Michael, a Messianic Rabbi, who writes screenplays on the side, is tempted by a sexy Hollywood agent who offers him big bucks to write TV shows in Hollywood, but only if he agrees to sleep with her. Under pressure from Jewish family and friends who are offended with him preaching about Jesus, Michael risks losing his ministry and betraying his beloved wife and 4 children if he doesn't stick to his principles. This romantic comedy presents an inside view of the unique Jewish sub-culture known as "messianic Jews", who believe Yeshua (Jesus) is the Messiah, and who are often shunned by mainstream Jews, even though they keep traditional Jewish customs and traditions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494400</url></doc>
