<plot>LIFELIKE MINE revolves around the relationship of a close and playfully affectionate couple, Cyan and Race. Things take a turn for the worse though when Cyan succumbs to a series of abdominal pains that is later identified as the illness of ovarian cancer. Told by her doctor, Cyan learns she may never be able to have children. During her arduous journey, she loses her job due to company cut-backs, as well as Race, when he dies in a freak accident. Cyan is later treated for her disease and seeks comfort in a women's cancer support group. Shortly after, she is again afflicted with a pain in her stomach, but learns that the pain was due to a pregnancy she was told she would never have. Paralled with a "prophetic" story-line of Cyan working in a photo lab, the film ends with Cyan appearing at the door of the lab to find a new job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336035</url></doc>
