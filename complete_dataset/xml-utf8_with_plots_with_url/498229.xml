<plot>The rich tradition of four-part harmony reached its peak in the late 1930s and 40s. What had been a gospel and vaudeville vocal style was adapted to popular songs, and the Mills Brothers, along with the Delta Rhythm Boys were the premier groups that captured America's attention. Their vocal stylings laid the groundwork for generations of Pop and Soul groups to follow! Here are rare, early appearances by all three of these landmark groups - all on one sensational DVD. No fan of pop or rhythm and blues should miss out on this extraordinary collection!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?498229</url></doc>
