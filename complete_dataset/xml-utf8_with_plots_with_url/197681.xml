<plot>This documentary by Wellington based filmmaker Hannah Clarke takes us behind the scenes with Flight of the Conchords. We meet Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement whose musical comedy collaboration has taken them from being "New Zealand's fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo acapella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo" to comedy stages around the world and on to a much loved HBO television series. Filmed throughout the production and after the release of the first season of the series, Flight of the Conchords: On Air gives it's audience a privileged look at the making of the hit TV show. As well as the show's protagonists we are introduced to director and co-creator, the Executive producer, and cast members as well as a medley of fans, crew and friends. Both hilarious and illuminating we get up close with the Conchords as they face the challenges of producing a successful show and experience their new found fame.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197681</url></doc>
