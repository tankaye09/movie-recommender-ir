<plot>In a world after death between heaven and hell, Michael, twenties, is being judged based on his life choices and experiences to determine his fate. He reflects on how his father grew mad after the murder of his six year old daughter, blaming Michael since he stood beside her at the creek when he was ten years old during her last breaths alive. Only Michael knows what really happened to her, but he's too scared to admit the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121898</url></doc>
