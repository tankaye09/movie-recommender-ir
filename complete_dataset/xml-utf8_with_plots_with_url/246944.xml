<plot>Pinky and Atul alias Bunty are in love with each other, and plan to marry. They, however, run into opposition with their respective families, as their life-partners have already been picked for them. Pinky's dad, a retired Colonel has picked Police Inspector Arjun to be Pinky's groom; while Ajit and Asha, Bunty's dad and mom, have picked Shobha to be Bunty's bride. Both Bunty and Pinky plan to go through with their respective marriages to the partners of their parents' choices, and then eventually divorce them, and then get married to each other. They give in to their parents' choices, and their parents are delighted and both the weddings take place with great pomp and ceremony. Pinky then starts picking fights with Arjun and his mom, and openly insults them; while Bunty also does the same with Shobha. Their plans seem to be going on track, until they come to know that Shobha and Arjun are meeting on the sly. What impact will this have on their plans and their marriage?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246944</url></doc>
