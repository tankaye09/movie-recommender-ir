<plot>Having been a cornerstone of American life and a model of the domestic ideal, Martha Stewart was sentenced to prison for trading violations. Not appealing her conviction (and thus sending the price of her company stock rising) she was to spend 5 months in jail in West Virginia - surely the end of her all-American role as domestic goddess? In order to understand this person more and get a feel for why she is so important and influential and how the conviction will affect her position, Jamie Campbell traveled to America and moved into a trailer park opposite her jail. While talking to fans and critics about Stewart he also tries to live his life in the way that Stewart's books, magazines TV shows etc have presented as the domestic model for American families.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?359289</url></doc>
