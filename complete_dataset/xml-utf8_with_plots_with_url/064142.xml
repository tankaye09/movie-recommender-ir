<plot>Being Dad 2 features even more new dads as they share the experiences and joys of becoming active, involved dads. The DVD follows several Dads home and shows how they balance work, home and relationships as a new and exciting dimension is added to their lifestyles. A broad variety of topics is covered, from the blur of those first few weeks, through sleep deprivation and building a routine, to strengthening relationships with a partner. Dads discuss diaper changes, traveling with babies, separation anxiety, immunizations, illnesses and more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064142</url></doc>
