<plot>Can someone who no one sees but is seen by everyone really just fade away? During a harsh 24hrs a nameless man wanders the streets of Nottingham searching for the last bit of charity an unforgiving culture has to offer. Over the course of a day he is subjected to three wildly varying forms of compassion, abuse and humility. Sensing that he is about to drop off the edge of a society that has turned its back on him, he commemorates the friends he lost to the streets by placing flowers on their open graves. For a brief moment this flash of colour makes the grey city seem warm and forgiving. Within the next few days... Nottingham Nobody vanishes without trace.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401683</url></doc>
