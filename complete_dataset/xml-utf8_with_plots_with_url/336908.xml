<plot>Limelight is the story of six people dedicated to pursuing fame and fortune at any cost. A national karaoke competition being held in Las Vegas looks to be their best chance at fulfilling their dreams of superstardom. Through interviews, lifestyle footage and karaoke performances, the characters' distinct personalities come alive as their individual journeys are documented by a film crew. Ace Stradlin, millionaire playboy, has the fortune, now he just wants people to know he has it. A wrestler in therapy uses karaoke to soothe his "beast" side. A former beauty contest runner-up refuses to accept second place and vows to win, as "failure is not an option". Aspiring opera singer Desiree Trianne sees the competition as a launching pad to performing at Luscala one day. Hailing from a small town in Kentucky, young Dakotah Frost dreams of becoming the next Shania Twain. Finally, an Elvis Impersonator who thinks he is the King reincarnated rounds out the contestants hoping to be crowned "The King of Karaoke". Think "Best in Show" meets Karaoke in this hilarious mockumentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336908</url></doc>
