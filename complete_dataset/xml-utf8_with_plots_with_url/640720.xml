<plot>In "Villa de Ves" we take a look into the world of Luc, a man in his mid-forties who lives in a small village in Belgium and is the proud owner of the local tobacco. Luc is born and raised in this village, everyone knows him but he stays a very quite person. In this little village is not happening much. He doesn't have a wife or children the only thing he has is a pair of fishes in an aquarium. It seems like the wind is always blowing from the same direction and the grass always stays the same colour green. On one day his sister who lives in a village in the south of Spain, called Villa de Ves, calls him up. She tries to convince him to leave his safe surroundings and move to Spain to live with her. Finally, he makes an important decision: he is going to his sister in Spain. But what will he do with his little tiny tobacco store? And does he have enough perseverance to make his little dream come true?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640720</url></doc>
