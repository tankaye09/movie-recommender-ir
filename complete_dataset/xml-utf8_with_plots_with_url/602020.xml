<plot>Matthew, a 9 year old with a curious innocent gaze at the world, is still capable of wonder, surprise, dream, and fear. He soon experiences that even the most obscure nightmare a child has to confront now has to face a reality that is cruel beyond anyone's imagination. There's no more space for fantasy because his childhood will quickly darken behind the shadow of past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602020</url></doc>
