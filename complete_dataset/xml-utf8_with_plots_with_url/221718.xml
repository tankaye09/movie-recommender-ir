<plot>Grandfather has fallen asleep in his arm chair. A small boy and girl enter with the intention of frightening the old gentleman with a death head mask. Seeing that the old gentleman is asleep, they place the mask on the back of his head and throw a sheet over his shoulders. The children then hide and old grandmother enters. She is greatly startled at the hideous apparition, and through her screams arouses the old gentleman, who jumps up in startled amazement. The old couple quickly appreciate the joke, however, and in fun start to chase the children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221718</url></doc>
