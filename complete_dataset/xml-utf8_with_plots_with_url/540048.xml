<plot>The American Film Institute presents Martin Scorsese with their twenty-fifth Life Achievement Award. Director, producer, editor, writer, actor, historian, movie buff, film preservationist and champion of artists' rights, Martin Scorsese has left his mark on virtually every aspect of the motion picture. He is among the finest and most influential of American directors, past and present. Scorsese directed his first low-budget feature, "Who's That Knocking at My Door?" (1969), while attending NYU. This character study about freedom and guilt - Catholic and otherwise - led to assignments as an editor on "Woodstock" (1970) and as post-production supervisor on "Medicine Ball Caravan" (1971). Scorsese film clips on the program include "Mean Streets" (1973), "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" (1974), "Taxi Driver" (1976), "New York, New York" (1977), "Raging Bull" (1980), "The King of Comedy" (1983), "After Hours" (1985), "The Color of Money" (1986), "The Last Temptation of Christ" (1988), "GoodFellas" (1990), "Cape Fear" (1991), "The Age of Innocence" (1993) and "Casino" (1995). Those appearing on the program include Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, Kris Kristofferson, Winona Ryder, James Woods, Kevin Pollak, Jodie Foster, Robert De Niro, Don Rickles, Gregory Peck, Paul Sorvino, Billy Bob Thornton, Clint Eastwood and George Stevens, Jr.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540048</url></doc>
