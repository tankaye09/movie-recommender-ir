<plot>Jimmy Allen never considered raising his daughter, Gracie, as a single dad - until he lost the love of his life in the quiet Southern town of Buford. As Jimmy struggles with his role of Mr. Mom, he offers cumbersome, clunky advice to his bright-eyed daughter. Wise beyond her years, she hears and understands more than her daddy ever knows. Who knew the playful words he taught her as a young girl would mean so much and ultimately guide them both through life and love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?029418</url></doc>
