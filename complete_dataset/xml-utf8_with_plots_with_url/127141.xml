<plot>Darrel Roberts had been given the Book of Keos, the Key to the Gates of Heaven and all the treasures within! The ancient monks who had penned the tome wrote it in a cryptic language which only Darrel seemed to know. While Darrel was performing the translations, ruthless organizations were watching him bent on possessing the book as soon as he was done, The Iron Dragon, Serrata's Dark Cult, and the FBI. And then there was that mad man Louiss who seemed to be everywhere and who knew a lot more than most humans knew about other dimensions. But whose side was he on? All Darrel had to do was to remain alive long enough to complete his work but the longer the book was in his the closer he came to suffer the fates of its authors the monks...and they had all been slaughtered!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127141</url></doc>
