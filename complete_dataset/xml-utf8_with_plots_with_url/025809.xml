<plot>A hooded youth carrying a goldfish in a plastic bag walks aimlessly through an underground NYC subway stop that has the look of a Kar Wai Wong film. Through the crowd comes a young woman all in orange, from her hair, sunglasses, lipstick, jewelry, and clothes to her nail polish. She drops a plastic bag containing a goldfish. He picks it up, gives chase, and stares at her after the train door has closed before he can reach her. He takes her photograph. The next day, wearing the same jacket, he waits for her, but on the wrong platform - again he sees her, runs, and reaches the train to stare at her as it pulls away. He has a surprise for her. Will all this ever bear fruit?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025809</url></doc>
