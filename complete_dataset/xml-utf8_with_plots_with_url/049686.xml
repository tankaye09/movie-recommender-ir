<plot>Manning, his infant daughter, and Pete are the sole survivors of an Indian attack. Pete is sealed to die in a lost mine, and Indians take the little girl with them, believing her father to be dead. The girl is adopted by Chief Brown Bear. Twenty years later, Spring Breeze, the chief's daughter, finds an insane old man in the hills and takes him to the Indian camp. He is enticed away from the camp by Mexican prospectors who want the gold nuggets the old man carries. The Indians go to rescue the old man and in the ensuing fight, the old man is hit on the head. The blow restores his memory and he realizes that Spring Breeze is his daughter. The chief chases a Mexican who attempts to climb down a rope to a ledge below. He is about to jump down to the ledge when he sees the chief waiting for him with a knife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049686</url></doc>
