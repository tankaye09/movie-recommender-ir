<plot>Billy, a lonely and emotionally neglected ten-year-old living the typical upper middle class life has a crush on his best friend Bella Rose. His attempts at expressing his feelings, however, are met with rejection since she insists that they are only friends. Jealousy consumes Billy the day that Bella Rose meets Mason and a friendship is formed between the two. After a heated confrontation with them at the local park, Billy returns home rejected and furious. His anger, coupled with the pervasive influence of society's comfort with violence, only grows until one afternoon, armed with his father's gun, he arrives at the park to find Bella Rose and Mason hanging out together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064539</url></doc>
