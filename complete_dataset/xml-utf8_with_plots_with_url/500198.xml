<plot>The greatest skiing picture we have yet produced. The skiers are seen coming down a very steep incline at a high rate of speed. A miniature hill is placed in the centre of the coast, over which the skiers must slide. As they come up the incline of the little hill, they spring into the air and jump great distances, some of them attaining a distance of forty or fifty feet in one single jump. This is an accomplishment quite unknown outside of Norway and Sweden, and our picture is an excellent demonstration of the sport.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?500198</url></doc>
