<plot>"Lawman" is a character driven western genre story which, in the tradition of such films as "Shane" and "High Noon", tells of a man who must defeat overwhelming odds in order to defend a helpless town of people who will not stand with him. The story's main character is Tom Chance, a man recently released from service in the cavalry. He comes to the town of Confusion, destitute and looking for work, and finds himself befriended by an aging Marshall. When the Marshall is gunned down by members of a faction attempting to take over the town's businesses, Chance, honor bound by his friend's dying wishes, reluctantly takes over as the town's new lawman. Once he makes the decision to stand and fight these men he finds that he is alone in his battle. There are few in town brave enough to stand with him, and those that do are dispatched with viscously by Chance's enemies. To defeat this ruthless gang, Chance must learn to outwit, out gun, and beat them at their own game. What follows is an all out war between Chance and a group of men with seemingly endless resources, and a town and its people caught in the middle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321720</url></doc>
