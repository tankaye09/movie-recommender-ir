<plot>An updated version of the classic game show, hosted by Jack Narz. Contestants would choose a pair of squares from a grid of 30. Under each square was a prize. If the prizes matched, the contestant got to keep them, and a piece of the rebus puzzle underneath the squares was revealed. The contestant who was able to solve the rebus was the winner of the game and won all the prizes they accumulated during the course of the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113351</url></doc>
