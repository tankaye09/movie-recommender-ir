<plot>70 critics and filmmakers discuss cinema from the age old conflict between the artist and the observer, the creator and the critic. From 1998 to 2007, Kleber Mendonça Filho has collected points of view about this relationship in Brazil, USA and Europe, using his personal experience as both filmmaker and critic. Crítico opens a window to an art which is more and more judged by the industry and which struggles to remain human in the way it is realized and observed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119124</url></doc>
