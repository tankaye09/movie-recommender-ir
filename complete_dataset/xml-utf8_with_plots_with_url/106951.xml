<plot>Here we show another strip of the west Midway, the camera having been stationed directly in front of the Japanese village and looking north, taking in the Midway's west side. It then revolves from left to right, the lens just passing over the heads of the great crowd assembled; brings into view many interesting features, including the Indian Congress arena, Scenic Railway, Japanese Village, Streets of Venice, and finally resting, looking south toward the canal, which encircles the Exposition.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106951</url></doc>
