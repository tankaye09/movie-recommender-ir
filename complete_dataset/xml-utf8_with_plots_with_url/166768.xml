<plot>"This regiment recruited from the neighborhood of President McKinley's home in Canton, is one of the few volunteer organizations which went through the Campaign before Santiago. The regiment is shown at Camp Wikoff, headed by Col. (now Congressman) Charles Dick, and presents a very brave appearance, although the men are in a sad condition from fever and exposure."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166768</url></doc>
