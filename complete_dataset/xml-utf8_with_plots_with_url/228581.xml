<plot>Unknown to most Americans, hand game - also called stick game or bone game - is the most widely played Native gambling game in North America. Every year thousands of Native Americans pack up their lawn chairs and game sets and hit the "hand game trail," competing on reservations throughout the west.  "Hand Game" explores the mythic and historic roots of contemporary gambling in Northwest Native America. Through plenty of beautifully photographed games and on-the-spot interviews from five states and seven reservations, "Hand Game" takes you on a journey through Indian Country, a journey full of laughter and engaging characters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?228581</url></doc>
