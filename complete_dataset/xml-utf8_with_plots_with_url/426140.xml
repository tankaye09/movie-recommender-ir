<plot>A fascinating story of the truth behind the legend and history of St Patrick. He was Welsh and even though he was thought to be Irish. "Patrick" is released in time for St. Patrick's Day (March 17, 2004) His life is remarkable and his story will be aired on television in "Patrick," an hour-long docudrama airing on Hallmark Channel. "Patrick" will shed light on one of the best-loved and least-understood icons of world religion. This special will feature the world reknown voices of two of Ireland's incredible top actors: with narration by Liam Neeson (aka Schindler's List &amp; Rob Roy) and also Gabriel Byrne supplying the voice of Patrick. There is also an on-air commentary provided by renowned Irish-American author Frank McCourt, who gives insight on how a foreign evangelical would have interacted with the Irish. The story of the real St. Patrick is a fabulous mix of part adventure tale and part spiritual awakening. This portrayal of Patrick who lived in the fifth century was shot on location in Ireland, using actors and actresses in period dress to recreate scenes from Patrick's life. He was born into an upper class patrician family in Roman Britain. When Patrick was an adolescent he was captured by slave traders and sold into captivity in Ireland. After almost six years as a slave Patrick experienced a religious awakening that inspired him to make his escape from Ireland. After his safe return to his homeland Patrick trained for the priesthood. Patrick decided to return to Ireland, where he was a slave, to preach a doctrine of love, tolerance and redemption. His radical ideas were suspect and he attracted the censure of the Church establishment in Roman Britain and he was henceforth branded as a renegade. Patrick refused to compromise this commitment and soon won the respect and love of the Irish and even the finally the reluctant support of his detractors. He started out as a slave an eventually became a liberator, who learned to forgive and ultimately love his enemies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426140</url></doc>
