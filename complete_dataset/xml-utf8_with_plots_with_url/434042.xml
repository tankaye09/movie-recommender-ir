<plot>This idiosyncratic mix of drama and black humor is about an aristocratic old lady, used to an out-dated, formal lifestyle in her family mansion, who finds herself at odds with the hippies on the streets, some of whom trespass onto her property for a bit of sexual promiscuity. She invites a doctor friend for dinner, and casually turns the discussion to the topic of suicide. the doctor suggests some methods, including a gun shot, which he find has some kind of 'dignity' to it. So the old lady breaks out a gun from her familial belongings, but the ancient weapon no longer works. She tries getting it fixed at an antiques shop, but things take a pleasant turn when she finds herself getting friendly with the proprietor. however, just as the suicidal thoughts are receding from her head, events take a turn once again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434042</url></doc>
