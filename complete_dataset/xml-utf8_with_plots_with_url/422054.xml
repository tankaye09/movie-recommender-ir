<plot>The picture shows immense crowds in the background held in check by soldiers and policemen. Immediately the President's body rests upon the catafalque in the rotunda of the City Hall, the ropes which held the crowd in check are removed and a great rush is made for the City Hall entrance. The profound respect and reverence in which the President is held is here demonstrated, as the police check the entire multitude by simply raising their hands to them and they immediately form in an orderly procession four abreast and quietly await their turn to pass in and view their beloved ruler.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422054</url></doc>
