<plot>The scene opens showing a party of tourists mounted on donkeys, and each accompanied by a guide, slowly wending their way up a beautiful mountain road in the Alps. The scene then changes to the resting place where the party stop for lunch. The lunch is concluded, and they are seen mounting the donkeys; the ladies mounting from a short stepladder. They proceed up the steep mountain side, and here the scene changes for the third time, and they are seen, staffs in hand, slowly picking their way over the glaciers on the summit of the steep mountain. There are a number of ladies in the picture, and they seem to be experts at mountain climbing. The panoramic camera follows them as they pick their way over the dangerous rocks and cross bridges that span chasms which seem to be thousands of feet deep. Finally a beautiful waterfall is reached, where a hugh volume of water is swept in raging torrents over a great jagged rock. The scene changes again, and the party are observed crossing a rustic bridge over the falls mentioned above, the water rushing beneath them in mad fury. The fifth scene is most thrilling, showing the party slowly picking their way along an almost perpendicular wall on the side of a huge cliff. This is a most comprehensive illustration of mountain climbing in Switzerland.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?614544</url></doc>
