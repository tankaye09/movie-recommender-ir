<plot>20th Century-Fox, concentrating on their own CinemaScope films and therby not making enough films to meet their release needs, went outside to independent film makers to make up for the studio's output, and the consequences was that director/producer names such as Wesley Barry and Edward L. Alperson (on this one) and the likes of Sig 'n Sam Neufeld/Newfield on others, found their names, to the surprise of probably themselves and certainly to the film-going public, on screen behind the 20th Century-Fox logo. No matter the reason or how it was packaged, a whole lot of B-dross, minus the production values the studio usually managed to disguise their own in-house dross with, begin to appear. This one has Jess Raidley (Bill Williams), not-ready-to-quit henchman of retired outlaw Jim Dalton (Nelson Leigh), carrying on with business as usual. When circumstances force Jess to kill Dalton, the latter's daughter, Kate (Kelly Ryan), blames sight-unseem Marshal Dan Porter (Jim Davis), whom she does not know by sight or name. She relocates to another town, meets and falls in love with Porter, but joins Jess' outlaw gang when she learns he is the man she was told thal killed her father. She thinks of Jess as a glorified thief but her illusions are soon destroyed when she discovers his true ignoble character. As Porter closes in on Jess, she leaves him and is ready to face the consequences. Character name lesson: Marshall is a proper name, while marshal is a lawman's title, and the two aren't the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418471</url></doc>
