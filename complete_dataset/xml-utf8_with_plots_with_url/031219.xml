<plot>Cast members as well as viewers share what they remember about All in the Family. Even interviewed are viewers who were somewhat offended by Archie Bunker's vocabulary, like he called African American people 'Spades', Puerto Ricans 'Spicks', Chinese 'Chinks', Jewish 'Hebes'. Also discussed are women who knew what Edith was going through and even contains scenes of the episode where a man attempted to rape her. The show that broke all boundaries in 1971 is discussed in this 20th anniversary edition!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031219</url></doc>
