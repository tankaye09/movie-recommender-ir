<plot>What is the essence of this documentary? When we speak about the elderly, mostly we do it from a distance, forgetting that we are and will become the same elderly too. Men and women who had lived a long life, share their memories and experiences, and speak to us nostalgically of their past. It also shows, perhaps as a metaphor or analogy, the undiscriminated destruction of the traditional suburbs of Santiago, Chile. This documentary is about the loss of our identity as individuals and as citizens. This documentary is about us.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400898</url></doc>
