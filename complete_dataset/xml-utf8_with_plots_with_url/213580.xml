<plot>Community college sucks. So, Gretta and Steve are desperate to move on. But when they buy their final term papers from their dubious tutor, Rick, the deal backfires for everyone. With only 45 minutes before class, romance soon develops in a race against time as Steve tries to get Gretta, figure out a way to make things right, and be in class on time. Along for the ride is Steve's best friend and sidekick, Mason, an outrageous, idiotic, but fun loving guy obsessing over lesbian drug dealers, women's studies, and snagging a few ounces of Rick's stolen Stash. All the while, they're forced to learn a tough lesson, "They should have just done the work themselves".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213580</url></doc>
