<plot>The fox spots a little lamb and disguises himself with a beard and bushy eyebrows. He posts an announcement for a baby contest, and the animal mothers spruce up their little ones (a rabbit and a pig). Meanwhile, the fox builds his judging stand. Several contestants are rejected: a squirrel, three ducklings, a whole family of rabbits, before the winner, little lamby. The fox reveals himself and motorcycles off, chased by the parents. He barricades himself in a hollow tree, where he starts preparing dinner while a ram heads a battering ram, a beaver starts eating his way in, and two birds start sawing, but the fox foils them all. The battering ram crew makes their way in just in time, and the lamb is rescued while the fox is punished.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338186</url></doc>
