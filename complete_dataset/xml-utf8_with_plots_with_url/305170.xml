<plot>Prince Ramiro, who is searching for a Princess, has changed places with his valet, Dandini - the better to discover the true nature of the ladies' hearts. When the Prince meets Cenerentola, there is instant attraction between them and they fall in love - while Cenerentola's stepsisters fawn over the fake prince (Dandini). Later, Alidoro, the Philosopher, takes Cenerentola (dressed in magnificent clothing) to the palace, where she enchants everyone with her beauty. Dandini (still posing as the prince) is smitten, and he tries to talk of love to Cenerentola, but she stops him, saying that she is in love with his 'valet'. Prince Ramiro (who has overheard this comment) is overjoyed, and immediately proposes to her, but she says that he must first seek her out - and then, if he still felt the same way about her, she would marry him. He says that he will follow her, but Cenerentola says he is not to do that. She gives him a bracelet, telling him to look for a matching bracelet on her right arm (she then leaves the palace). Prince Ramiro ends the masquerade, and he and Dandini resume their true identities. The Prince then sets out on his quest - little realising that destiny, in the form of a violent thunderstorm, is about to take a hand in the affair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?305170</url></doc>
