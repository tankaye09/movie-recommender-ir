<plot>Although India obtained freedom from the British in 1947, Goa and it's territories are still ruled by the Portuguese. A group of revolutionaries want a free Goa and are thus wanted by the Portuguese administration. Amongst them are Purandare, Narvekar, and Dinanath, and when Dinanath's whereabouts are known to the police, he escapes with his young son, Ramdas, and goes to their hideout. With the assistance of Purandare they do manage to escape but are shot. A horrified Ramdas watches as his dad is shot dead by Purandare. This is how Ramdas starts hating revolutionaries. Ramdas changes his name to Ronnie, befriends a girl named Julie, and grows up taking to crime as his career. He soon prospers and lets the villagers also prosper with him. Then when the Police Commissioner is shot dead, Ronnie helps the authorities to apprehend his killer, who is a young man named Shekhar, who is arrested, tried in Court, and sentenced to be hanged. It is at this point Ronnie will find out that the people he had assisted in the past are all against him and sympathize with the revolutionaries. Angered, he grabs a gun to kill Shekhar's parents - and it is here that Ronnie will find out who they really are - and why Purandare shot his dad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?447842</url></doc>
