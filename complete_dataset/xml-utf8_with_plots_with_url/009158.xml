<plot>Abbey Fisher, an investigative reporter, has everything one could want out of life except her own family. Happily married to Civil Rights Attorney, James, the couple's idealism as childhood sweethearts has been thwarted through their drive to attain the American dream and leaves them empty and in a politically correct lifestyle that has stolen their own sense of value. Through advice of their fertility specialist Abbey decides to take a leave of absence in order to start the family she has been trying for several years to have and to regain her sense of purpose. Can her heart-strings withstand the challenge however, when she learns that children and youth are victims of a rapidly growing sex trade operation right under her nose. She meets young Bethany Stevenson, a sex trafficked victim from the age of 12 and becomes driven, risking her own dreams to help the teenager into a new life. Never knowing what it's like to be respected and loved as a young lady, overcoming fear and learning to trust is Bethany's challenge but her resilience and courage aid in her own redemption along with the help of Abbey and young dance instructor Eric Vandevere. Senator George Abbot, left of the left, opposes Abbey's attempt at creating legislation to stop the retailing of sex in the US. That everything is not as it seems and may just be upside down and backwards is a lesson Abbey learns through her trek.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009158</url></doc>
