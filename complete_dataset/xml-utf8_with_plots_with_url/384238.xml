<plot>My Kind of Town is an ABC television show that premiered on Sunday, August 14, 2005 at 9:00 P.M. (EST). Part reality television, part game show, the show brings 200 people from a small town in the United States to New York City to compete for prizes and participate in games and assorted gags. At the end of the show, one of the 200 who was preselected prior to the show competes in a game called "Name Your Neighbors" where, if the person is successful in identifying the names of six people featured in the program, the entire audience wins a prize. The show is hosted by English television and radio presenter Johnny Vaughan. The show's executive producer is Michael Davies, who was also the producer of the American version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384238</url></doc>
