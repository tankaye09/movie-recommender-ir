<plot>"Mile Zero" marks the location of Key West--the island that defines the end of the American road, the cultural junction where Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Afro worlds collide. On this island, with its cruel legacy of slave trade and Latin revolution, and its turbulent present of marijuana millionaires, threadbare illegal immigrants, and hard luck treasure hunters, lives St. Cloud, an American expatriated in his own country drinking away his sorrows every hour he is awake. When a murder spree begins to occur on the island somehow St. Cloud finds himself caught in the middle. Will the events that occur 3 days leading up to Fantasy Fest change him and the island for the best or will he end like so many have ended here before-- existing on mile zero.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?369839</url></doc>
