<plot>We've all seen homeless people pushing shopping carts down the street, shopping carts packed to the brim with all kinds of "junk." But what's actually inside those shopping carts anyway? In an almost surreal show-and-tell, this documentary allows homeless people to explain just what they carry in their traveling carts-and why. In this simple and humanizing film, some thirty men and women explain what they have in their carts, and why the items they push around are so important to their physical, psychological, and spiritual survival. You'll never look at those carts the same way again!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335751</url></doc>
