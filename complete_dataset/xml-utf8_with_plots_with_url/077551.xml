Noi is persuaded by Toui, a young woman she knows well, to leave home for an apparently attractive job in neighboring Thailand. Once there, Noi realizes too late that Toui is actually a broker. She has been sold. Her hopes of a better life are shattered as she suffers both physical and sexual abuse.
