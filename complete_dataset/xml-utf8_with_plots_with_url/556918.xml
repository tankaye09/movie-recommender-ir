<plot>Josiah Cornstalk calls on Melinda Squash and brings his fiddle with him. He seats himself on the back of a chair and she at her spinning wheel, prepared to enjoy an evening with her 60 year old beau. He finally gets his fiddle tuned up and plays a jig so lively that Melinda cannot sit still. She therefore drops her work and advancing to the center of the floor, proceeds to do a lively breakdown, exposing at the same time her "lingerie." While in the midst of their hilarity, a rat runs across the floor and her old maidlet runs about like wild until Josiah attempting to scare the rat away with his precious fiddle hits too hard and the "Stradivarius" is dashed to splinters on the floor. Exceedingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556918</url></doc>
