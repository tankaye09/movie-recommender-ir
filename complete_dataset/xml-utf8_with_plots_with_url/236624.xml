<plot>Two famous wide-screen blockbusters, Hercules and Hercules Unchained have been re-edited into one, fast-paced, outrageous comedy-adventure - Hercules Recycled. It's 2024 A.D. Technology has vanished. MTV is but a memory. And commuters travel by horse-drawn chariot. But one hope remains - a lost, secret energy formula written on the back of a golden bath mat which can restore civilization to its former splendor! Only one man is buff enough to stand against blood-thirsty special interest groups, battle savage fast-food mutants, and capture the formula - that man is TV exercise show host Burt Galaxy (Steve Reeves)!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236624</url></doc>
