<plot>In the real world, a man can lose his faith and his charity. Fate is about to bring it back. Monsignor Pace, cold, arrogant, and proud, is unforgiving toward sinners. That is, until one night, when a young prostitute kidnaps him and forces him to confess her. Through her death, he must confront his life and one particular demon. Having grown materialistic over the years, Monsignor Pace, who is about to become a bishop, feels no charity towards his fellow human beings, especially with one alcoholic priest, Fr. Ramsey. Taking place over two days, Pace confronts Ramsey about his drinking, and the fact that he sodomized a 16 year old, female alter-server. Ramsey's delusion that they are to get married changes to a confession that he couldn't stand seeing her beauty anymore without acting. Pace is bored with him and after chastising him, makes him sign a confession and orders him to rehab center all the while taunting him, and bribing him with a bottle of whiskey in sight. Something that brings a smile across the face of one that lives for this torture. One that wants to come and collect Pace's soul, the demon, Taoz. A demon that uses the guise of both a man and a woman. While visiting and selling drugs to a customer at a high-class home, the young drug dealer and prostitute, Lisa, notices Pace surrounded by the rich, older women toasting and celebrating his upcoming promotion in the church. It's there that she makes up her mind to kidnap him. She has to. She's a Catholic, after all. And this night, she will need to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?463861</url></doc>
