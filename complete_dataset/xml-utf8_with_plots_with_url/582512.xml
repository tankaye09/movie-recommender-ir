<plot>When Meagan notices an object in a photograph, which vaguely resembles a dead person, she's sure her husband will want to look into it further. After all, he collects newspaper crime stories and was the one who snapped the shot. So when he shows no interest in the matter, Meagan is a little surprised and further intrigued. Intrigued to the point where she decides to visit the desolate spot alone. The events that follow will make you wonder: Was there really a dead person on the photograph, or is Meagan's old mental instability beginning to resurface?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582512</url></doc>
