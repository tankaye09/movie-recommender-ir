<plot>Filmed in the famous Abbey Road studios, this live set by Donavon Frankenreiter showcases his talent in many ways. Initially playing with his band, he is then joined by a string quartet, ending with a massive sing-in as fans join him on the podium. Extras include background rehearsal material, and a version of "With a little help from my friends", performed in Studio B where The Beatles first composed it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?155928</url></doc>
