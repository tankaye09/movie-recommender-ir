<plot>Here we depict an up-to-date surgical operation, showing a man's leg being amputated just above the knee joint. Three surgeons are engaged in the work and are attended by several female trained nurses. The camera is placed in such a position as to command a clear view of the entire operation. Each cut of the surgeon's knife is plainly shown in detail, even to the sawing of the bone, the cauterizing of the wound, and the sewing and the bandaging. This is a picture that will doubtless interest the medical fraternity or lecturers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036293</url></doc>
