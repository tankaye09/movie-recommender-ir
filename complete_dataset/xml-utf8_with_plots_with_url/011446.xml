<plot>In the aftermath of a family tragedy, the men of the house are left to their own devices. Earl Bailey hasn't always been a good father to Will and seeks his forgiveness. He watches daily as his only son mistreats his ten-year-old grandson, Thomas. Thomas loves butterflies and has learned about the Legend of the Butterfly from his mother. The Legend states that if you whisper a wish to a butterfly and set it free, the butterfly will carry the wish off to the heavens to be granted. After saving a butterfly from a spider's web, Thomas coaxes Earl into making a wish and releases it to the heavens. Before long, a mysterious stranger, John, shows up in the abandoned plantation home next door. Strange things begin to transform Earl and Thomas' world as the wish begins to take shape. With only 25 days, the life span of a butterfly, to complete the wish, Earl realizes that time is running out to get through to his son and make a better life for his grandson.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011446</url></doc>
