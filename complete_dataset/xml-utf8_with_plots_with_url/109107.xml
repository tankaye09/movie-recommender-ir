<plot>Clouds is about how our memories affect us. It is the story of a boy (Timothy) who once became lost in the forest and who used his vivid imagination to help him stay calm and find his way home, recounted by the boy ten years later to his friend Imogen. For Timothy, the events he recounts changed his life. Instead of remembering the truth of what happened, he has instead formed a different, sweetened version, which forms his memory. Although technically he is tricking himself, emotionally, this truth is better for him. Imogen understands this and knows the real truth is not something he should have to comprehend. In this way, Clouds is a mediation on how memories affect us. The fantastical story extrapolates how our interpretation of certain events shape who we are and how we see ourselves. Knowing that we are constructions of our past is important for establishing our identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109107</url></doc>
