<plot>Presents the painted pottery bowls of the Mimbres, a Native American people who lived in the isolated mountain valleys and hot deserts of southwestern New Mexico until their culture died out in the twelfth century. Their pottery art flourished during the years 950 to 1150. Discovered in the late nineteenth century, the ancient pottery is decorated with images that depict the daily lives of the Mimbres, their physical landscape, and their spiritual beliefs. Concentrates on some of the major aesthetic aspects of Mimbres pottery painting, such as the challenge of the concave, hemispheric picture surface and the ambiguous play of pictorial dualities (motion/stillness, white/black, top/bottom). Mobile prop tables and carefully choreographed camera movements were used to elucidate the three-dimensional pictorial qualities of the painted bowls. Includes voice-over commentary by cultural historian Rina Swentzell, a member of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420542</url></doc>
