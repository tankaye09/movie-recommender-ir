<plot>Sam Niver had terminal cancer; the end was near. Proud and fiercely independent, he wanted control in death as well as in life. He could die in a hospital or die at home -- hopefully on his own terms. Sam believed strongly in dignified death. Could he act on his belief? In "Live &amp; Let Go" we meet Sam: WWII veteran; hometown newspaperman; civic leader; loving husband, father and friend. We see Sam and his family recall his life, and confront his thoughts about impending death. We follow him on his intimate, personal journey as he reflects on the past and decides on his future. We live Sam's final months and days, and we learn his ultimate choice. He dies -- and we share the wrenching experience. "Live &amp; Let Go" tackles death -- the universal fact of life -- with unflinching candor. It tells one man's story about the choice he makes -- one that every one of us must ultimately face.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338844</url></doc>
