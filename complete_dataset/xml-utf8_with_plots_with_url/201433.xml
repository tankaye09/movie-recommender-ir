<plot>The scene is laid in front of the hosiery counter in a department store. Under the counter are four pairs of stocking forms with showy stockings on them. Four girls stand behind the counter in such fashion that it appears as if the legs belonged to them. A jay and his wife enter. He is greatly interested, but his wife is shocked and leads him away. The girls then work about behind the counter, showing the joke.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201433</url></doc>
