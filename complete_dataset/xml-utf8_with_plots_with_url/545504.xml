<plot>Covertly seeking to find a Box in a warehouse full of boxes, one JOHN DOE encounters a series of unfortunate and increasingly deliberate looking accidents while posing as a new worker on his first night of the graveyard shift. Once bizarre noises and the strange disappearance of his menacing foreman occur, John's investigation leads to the almost fatal accident of one of his co-workers. Together with his remaining co-worker, John tries to get help only to find the warehouse is without phone and more alarmingly without exit. As events unfold, John is eventually presented with the opportunity to discover what's in the Box - the enigmatic and unexpected revelation that explains everything and resolves nothing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545504</url></doc>
