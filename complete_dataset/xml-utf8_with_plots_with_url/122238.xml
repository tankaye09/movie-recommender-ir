<plot>In his last year of High School, life was looking pretty good to Philip Renold: His music, his band, his buddies, his school. Even his parents were pretty cool. But then everything changed. Insidiously, his friends turn against him, his teachers make fun of him, his parents plot against him and put him in a mental hospital. Told in flashbacks, Philip tries to figure out what is happening to him, how he got to this place, and it all seems hopeless until a strange young woman befriends him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?122238</url></doc>
