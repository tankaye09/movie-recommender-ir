<plot>Walter Pembroke III is a pampered pig who enjoys free food, a posh pen, and a flattering entry in the exclusive Barnyard Social Registry. Walt's best friend is Tiffany, a tough-talking spider who gets little respect and few handouts. But it is not the disapproval of Walt's snobby pals that is driving this pair of unlikely friends apart. It is Walt's expanding web of lies. When a pie disappears, Walt blames UFO's. When a bowl breaks, it's the ghost's fault. When homework goes missing, well, the dog was involved. Now Walt has fallen under the spell of Noiman Ja Rahr, a sneaky snake who schemes to take Walt to the corrupt Viperwood. Can the spider convince the pig that lying doesn't pay, or will Walt end up trapped in a frightening world where no one can be trusted? And nothing is as it seems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510250</url></doc>
