<plot>To seduce his wife, Morris has all the right intentions but all the wrong moves. A sweet but clueless husband, he sets the mood with fuzzy pink handcuffs and male enhancement pills but still finds himself in second place to the cell phone of his unsatisfied wife, Lara. A no-nonsense Lara avoids alone time with Morris by hurrying him out the door for a dinner party with her friends. Morris obeys but forgets the car keys, leaving the couple stuck in the driveway. Locked out and late, with Lara's patience thinning, Morris stumbles to find a way back into their house and hopefully back into Lara's good graces.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?395103</url></doc>
