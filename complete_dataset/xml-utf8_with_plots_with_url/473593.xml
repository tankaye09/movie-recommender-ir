<plot>After the death of their parents, Kamla Gulati and her elder brother live together and assist each other. Soon her brother gets a job and they move up in life. Then Kamla elopes with a young man and leaves her brother without informing him of her whereabouts. Shortly thereafter her pregnant body is found lifeless, abandoned by her boyfriend. Now Gulati is the President of an organization, and has promoted young Vinod Thakur as it's Vice-President. Gulati goes for a holiday in Panchgani and upon arrival at the local Circuit House meets with a young woman who identifies herself as Vinodini T. Gulati, the daughter of T.N. Gulati. He starts treating her as his sister and becomes very protective toward her. When he finds out that a young man named Amol Palekar alias Ramu is attempting to woo her, he forbids her to see or have any contact with him in any way, as he fears that she may end up like Kamla. He is headed for several surprises as he will soon find out that Vinodini is not who she claims to be, that, in fact, she is married, and her real husband is attempting to free her from the clutches of Mr. Gulati, by hook or by crook - even enlisting the services of local goon Pandu Dada - who has been known to kill in order to get his way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473593</url></doc>
