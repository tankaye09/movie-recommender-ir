<plot>Nadia Sawalha hosts this daytime quiz which was originally billed as an alternative to Anne Robinson's "The Weakest Link" (2000) on BBC1. Three contestants battle it out to get through to the grand final and the chance to win a dream world cruise. Generally, they are faced with a question and five possible answers. As time ticks by, an answer is eliminated, until only the correct one is left. The contestant must answer as early as possible in order to gain the most points.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270384</url></doc>
