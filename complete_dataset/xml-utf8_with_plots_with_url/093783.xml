<plot>"These pictures were taken by special permit of Captain Charles Dwight Sigsbee, who was commander on our ill-fated Battleship Maine at the time of the explosion, and who now commands the U.S. Battleship Texas. The well-known Captain Sigsbee is here shown on deck of his vessel. No fear need be entertained that any audience will tire of viewing warships and their commanders, and especially this one, who, after being assigned to the auxiliary cruiser St. Paul, gave a good account of himself and earned the reward of being placed in command of the splendid Battleship Texas."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093783</url></doc>
