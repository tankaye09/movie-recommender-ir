<plot>Domesticated animals and their many uses. Of 500,000 species of animals, an off-screen narrator tells us that about 50 have been domesticated. We see the uses of animals for food, for travel and transport, for clothing, for sport, and for work. Chickens are bred to provide eggs or meat. Cows and steers provide milk or meat. We visit sanitary packing houses, meat lockers, and the refrigerator cars of trains. We watch the harvest of ocean fish and visit a salmon cannery. Honey, silk, wool, and game come to use thanks to the talents of animals. We watch the fly, a public health enemy. Last, 80 percent of the world depends on animal power, but machines are making inroads.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040903</url></doc>
