<plot>In an underground, maximum security prison owned by a Halliburton-like uber corporation, casino mogul Charles Graydon has set up an illegal and diabolically attractive gambling opportunity - a series of ultimate fights to the death. All the contestants are convicted murderers on death row, but the ultimate victor will go free. Teetering on the brink of insolvency, Graydon has fixed the fight with a bribe that ensures his success, but, unbeknownst to him, the bribe ended up in the wrong pocket. Now all bets are off, the fight is anyone's guess, and Graydon could lose everything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421844</url></doc>
