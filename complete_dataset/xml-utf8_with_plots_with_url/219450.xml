<plot>Mike, a seven-year-old boy, has recently lost his mother in a car accident. Today is the day of the funeral and Mike's one goal is to find out what happened to his mother and where she is now. His father is too shell-shocked to respond to his questions and his grandmother is of the "old world" mindset that children should be seen and not heard. Just when it seems as if Mike will not receive the answers to his questions, his Aunt Libby arrives home and takes him on a journey to discover the truth. After seeing the sites involved in the accident they finally reach the desolate cemetery and Libby simply sits with Mike as he tries to process where his mom is now.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219450</url></doc>
