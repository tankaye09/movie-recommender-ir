<plot>A cutting edge short film, 'Keepsake' looks at the issue of domestic violence through the eyes of a young man, John Latham, who is coming to terms with the recent loss of his father, and the legacy of fear in his wake. John is trying to exorcise these demons as, working late in the shop one night, he wrestles with his thoughts and memories, and tries to rationalize the emotional maelstrom in his head.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?289049</url></doc>
