<plot>While patrolling his father's estate, Ravi Kapoor (Mithun Chakraborty) comes across a beautiful girl, Chandni (Zeenat Aman) taking a swim in a nearby lake. He is attracted to her, despite the fact that she mute. He saves her life from a wild leopard, and both fall in love, and get intimate. Fate tragically separates them, and Ravi is led to believe that she is dead. Ravi meets with her look-alike, Geeta Khanna, in the city, both are attracted to each, and soon marry. Years later, they come across a male child, who calls Geeta "mom", and they adopt him. Then Geeta feels sorry for a plain-looking mute woman, and decides to hire her. This woman claims that the child is her's, but Geeta shrugs her off. And then Geeta sees that her husband is attracted to this woman, and decides to take necessary steps to stop this from happening again, not realizing that on doing so, she will be changing her and her family's life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663438</url></doc>
