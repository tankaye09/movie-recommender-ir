<plot>"The Dream Center" documents the powerful impact that one church is having on the inner-city of Los Angeles. Housed in the old Queen of Angels hospital building, the Dream Center stands as a lighthouse of love for a lost and dying city. With over 200 outreach ministries, the Dream Center is setting the standard for the Church in the 21st Century. Watch as hosts Pastor Tommy Barnett and Pastor Matthew Barnett show you stories of changed lives-lives that were once broken and without hope but have now found hope in Jesus Christ to dream again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554269</url></doc>
