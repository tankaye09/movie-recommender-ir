<plot>The former socialist model village of Dedelow is a place where East German life is being actively preserved. The entire village became a registered limited company, a financially successful venture, and the directors of the board are those who were in control under the old regime. The inhabitants of Dedelow enjoy watching historical film footage of the establishment of their society. The film lovingly portrays the ironic realities of contemporary life in the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382720</url></doc>
