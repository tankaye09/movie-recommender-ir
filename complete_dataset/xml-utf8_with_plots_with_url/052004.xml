<plot>This is a new film, exhibiting a new subject. The automobile, although seldom seen in the smaller localities, has become a popular fad in the larger cities. Instead of the old style four-in-hand parades, the automobile owners unite in parading on some of the most fashionable boulevards. This film represents a scene of this description which occurred recently in New York City.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052004</url></doc>
