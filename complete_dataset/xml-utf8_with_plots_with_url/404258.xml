<plot>In São Paulo, the company of the clothier Carlos is near bankruptcy, with the creditors chasing him and without any order. When he receives a correspondence from a wealthy German entrepreneur, Herr Lachter, proposing a deal of thousands of trousers and jackets, it seems to be the salvation of his company. His imbecile cousin Pepino offers to go to Rio de Janeiro first to see the habits of Herr Lachter for a better negotiation. In Hotel Gloria, he collects information from the staff that the German is a lady-killer, having sex with the wives of his clients before signing the contract. Pepino hires Joana Coxalonga, a street prostitute, to pretend to be Carlos's wife during the dinner negotiation. But when Carlos's wife unexpectedly arrives in the hotel to spend a second honeymoon in Rio de Janeiro with Carlos, confusion begins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?404258</url></doc>
