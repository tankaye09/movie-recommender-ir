<plot>Sonia and Naina Sehgal (both played by Kajol) are twins. The two are completely different from each other, Sonia being the outgoing twin and Naina being the shy twin. At the same time the police are hunting for a killer and rapist. The man Gokul Pandit (Ashutosh Rana) is a cold-blooded animal and has chosen Naina for his next target. However tragedy strikes when Gokul brutally kills Sonia. Naina is distraught and vows to hunt down Gokul. Gokul soon goes after Naina and she realizes she needs help to overcome her fear of him. With that she meets Suraj Singh Rathod (Sanjay Dutt), a retired and blind major and he helps her physically and mentally to defeat her fear of Gokul. After an argument Suraj refuses to meet Naina and she decides to go after Gokul alone without the help of the police or Suraj.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162435</url></doc>
