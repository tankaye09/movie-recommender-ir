<plot>After Jack and his friend Tom talk about Jack's need to find a girlfriend, Jack runs in to Bev, the most beautiful girl he has ever seen, but misses the opportunity with her. He then decides to pursue her, and the first person he asks for help is Lisa, who seems interested in him. From there on out, during Jack's pursuit of Bev, who is obviously completely uninterested, he continually runs into Lisa, but brushes her off, while nearly missing Bev each time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?142526</url></doc>
