<plot>This is a picture of the familiar episode of a lost collar button. A crusty old bachelor who is dressing for an evening out loses his collar button. He happens to have his silk hat on his head while he is creeping about on the floor looking for the button. Just as he approaches the door the maid opens it, and the hat is crushed down over the bachelor's ears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009040</url></doc>
