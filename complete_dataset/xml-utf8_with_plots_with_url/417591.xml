<plot>Nashville, TN, the "buckle of the Bible Belt" and the country music capital of the world, has become one of the most popular destinations for Latino immigrants. Despite the recent growth of this community, until December of 2007 Hispanic Catholics did not have a place of worship they could call their own. This film follows the story of Nashville's first 100% Hispanic Catholic church from the idea of its creation through its inauguration and six months afterward. In it, we see a community that is proud and grateful, having finally found their own place to let go of their mind, let go of their spirit, and truly be free.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417591</url></doc>
