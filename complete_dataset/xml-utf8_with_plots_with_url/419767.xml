<plot>A moralistic social film in a contemporary setting. The plot concerns a young woman, Sarojini, who, under the influence of her jailbird cousin Jairam swindles her aged husband and ruins her lover, the next door neighbor Thakurdas. In spite of the moralism, the film's interest and energy derive from the depiction of moral turpitude and modernity represented by a race course, the cotton market and bars. Highlights include a car chase and Jairam's narrow escape from the police while Sarojini and Thakurdas end up in jail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419767</url></doc>
