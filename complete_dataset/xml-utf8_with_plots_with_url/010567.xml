<plot>Virgil, a man in his mid-forties, feels that he's let his two children, Sophie, 13, Chris, 17, and wife, Maggie, down when his business collapses and the collectors start calling. He concludes that his family is better off without him and decides to end his life. Unexpectedly, however, Chris comes home early, discovers his semi-unconscious father in the running car and saves his father's life. Virgil tries to avert the uncomfortable truth by taking his son to a diner, only to find out that Chris is tired of skirting the issue and playing pretend. Will they find the true meaning of life, family and success amidst stale coffee and fried eggs?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010567</url></doc>
