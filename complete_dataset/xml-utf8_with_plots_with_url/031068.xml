<plot>Paints the self-portrait of an American family, defying the boundaries of "The System". They were radicals, they were criminals, but they were always a family first. Told through the eyes of the mother and daughter we see the impact and tragedies that come from a lifestyle without restraint. With an extremely personal look at an individual's family history, "All We Had" follows a generation of crime, violence, corruption, and what it truly means to be a family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031068</url></doc>
