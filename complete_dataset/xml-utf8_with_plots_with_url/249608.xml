<plot>In 1934 Hughie Green, a nervous 14-year old performer, is pushed onto a stage in his native Canada. Twenty-four years later he is a big name in British television as the quiz-master of the popular game show 'Double Your Money'. Whilst on a stage tour with the show he meets a former show business acquaintance Jess Yates, now running a hotel with his young wife Elaine and Hughie stays with them. For the next decade and a half Hughie is a top name in British light entertainment, hosting a talent contest 'Opportunity Knocks'. His catch-phrase is "I mean that most sincerely" and he is shown to have a genuine loyalty to his audience and his staff. However, he is a serial womanizer, frequently indulging in sex in his dressing-room with female fans, and his wife leaves him, taking their son and daughter. Jess Yates re-enters television, initially hosting a religious programme called 'Stars On Sunday', earning him the nick-name of The Bishop. He becomes Hughie's producer and the two men clash. However, Hughie knows something that Jess does not - he and not Jess is the father of Elaine's child, Paula.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249608</url></doc>
