<plot>Frank Sakai, a grandfatherly widower is visited by Jerry, a new neighbor who comes bearing Christmas pie. As the two sit down to enjoy their dessert, Jerry notices the many family photographs scattered around the dining room. This gives Frank the opportunity to muse about his daughter, Sandy, and a special prayer they shared through the years. But Jerry's visit is abruptly cut short, and Frank will discover if Sandy has taken his teaching to heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427031</url></doc>
