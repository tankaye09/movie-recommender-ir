<plot>Following the brutal slaying of a call-girl named Julie in Bombay city, two police inspectors, namely Anil Sharma and Rajat Bedi, are assigned to investigate and bring the culprit(s) to book. Anil &amp; Rajat note that the killer leaves "2001" marked on the body of the victim. Anil comes to know that the man staying in Julie's room is a prominent Member of State Parliament, Ramaswamy, and would like to list him as a suspect. Julie's death is followed by more killings in the same style, and killed are Advocates Sarkari and Kajal, and a man named Krishna Rao. Then Ramaswamy himself is attacked, but survives and is hospitalized. When he regains consciousness for a brief period of time, he points an accusing finger at Rajat and then relapses. Not wanting to take any chance, Police Commissioner Malik has Rajat under house arrest. Then Anil comes across some evidence that links the killing to none other than Malik himself, while Rajat starts to gather together evidence against Anil. The question remains: Is the killer one of these police officers? If so, which one, or are all three collectively involved in these gruesome deaths?</plot><plot>Following the brutal slaying of a call-girl named Julie in Bombay city, two police inspectors, namely Anil Sharma and Rajat Bedi, are assigned to investigate and bring the culprit(s) to book.
