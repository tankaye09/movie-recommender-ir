<plot>The city of New Orleans is a ghost town after the hurricane Katrina. While most people left the city in fear, racism and poorness is there to stay. In a city full of racists and vigilantes, we meet the 58-year-old former Black Panther Malik Rahim. All his life he has been struggling to make a difference, been trying to pass on a better society to his children and grandchildren. In the aftermath of the hurricane Katrina, the need is greater than ever, and Malik uses the attention this brings, to begin the building of a long-term grassroots organization. The film starts in the days after the hurricane, and takes us on a journey to poor Afro-American neighborhoods where the mainstream media never goes. We meet despair, hate and a little hope despite all. But most of all it tells us the story about one man who wants to make a better world, and about his extraordinary fight for peace and justice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650149</url></doc>
