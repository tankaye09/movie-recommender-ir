<plot>Sento is an inspired romantic painter trying to find his way in the art circles with his theoretical artist friend Domingo. When Genoveva, the owner of the most prestigious gallery invites him to take part in the most influential art contest in the world, Sento starts to paint his masterpiece: a really big piece which will not fit into his crampy apartment. So he moves to a studio, intervening with the interests of the police, gangsters and an anarchist group who all claim the building and damage and add to the painting's design. The painting therefore paints itself and depicts the story of its creation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160177</url></doc>
