<plot>Following a crushing defeat in battle, an island people are forced into exile by their victors. In a dream, the chief envisions hope in the form of a guiding bird that will lead them across the unknown sea to a new home. Canoes are carved, provisions collected and so begins the voyage to find a new home. With only the stars and the promise of land to guide them, they sail north. But life on the sea is not easy. Fish must be caught for food and rain collected for water. Through windless doldrums and horrific storms they persevere to find their new home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?644001</url></doc>
