<plot>Britain's Favourite Hoaxer is an insider's view into the life of top sporting prankster Karl Power who was catapulted to fame after he managed to sneak on to the Manchester United team photo, in full kit, before their Champions League quarter final match against Bayern Munich in 2001 . We meet Karl and his partner Tommy 'the Brains' Dunne; two old mates from a Manchester Council estate as they blag and barge their way on to center stage at some of the biggest sporting events in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083437</url></doc>
