<plot>Child of God unravels the deep, disturbing and shocking life of a fetishist brought to his knees only to find recovery as a born-again Christian. Dean is a carpenter like his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He repairs dilapidated houses in a low income part of town. Never mind that Dean's mother just passed away. Never mind that his sister was just released from prison, and that he's just lost custody of his niece after years of bonded. And don't mind the fact that his wife divorced him, or that he has Asberger's syndrome. Never mind that he's a recovering crack addict and a former rock'n'roller. Dean's ultimate nemesis is a fetish so unbelievable you probably haven't heard of it and so powerful it brought him to the edge of the local bridge, ready to jump. So addictive that only God has been able to save him from it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411747</url></doc>
