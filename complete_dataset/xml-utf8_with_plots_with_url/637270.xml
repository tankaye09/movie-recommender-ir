<plot>A man reads a horror novel late at night. His imagination runs away with him; he thinks some dripping beverage is blood, is frightened by his own bear-skin rug, and faints when he sees a shadow of himself in a noose-like tangle of his phone cord. The ambulance arrives and finds the most threatening thing is a kitten in a sock and a shelf of horror novels. They cart off the novels and leave the man. (Note: A narration track was added for the USA release; this track was largely ignored in preparing the above summary. Chances are some footage was also deleted, as the film was about 2 minutes shorter than other shorts from the same studio in the same era.)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?637270</url></doc>
