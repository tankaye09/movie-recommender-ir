<plot>A group of Angelenos chase after their own version of happiness, as they scramble to get ahead and discover what is truly important in their lives. A young barista pines after a lost love, while her ex agonizes over whether he made the right decision. A rocket engineer is unfairly fired from his job because of an unsubstantiated office rumor. A ruthless businessman hires a bumbling country-boy to do his dirty work, while simultaneously contending with his gold-digging wife scheming to relieve him of his millions. In the hopes of getting him laid, a father sets his 23 year old virgin son up on a blind date with a sex crazed older woman, propelling the young man on a run for his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?636223</url></doc>
