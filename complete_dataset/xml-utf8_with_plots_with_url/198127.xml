<plot>Since 1955, Mrs. Bertha used to frequently visit the family grave at Del Roble Cemetery, in Monterrey, Mexico. Besides that tomb, lies the abandoned grave of the American soldier Edmond William Quear Jr. The inscription on the stone reads he died in 1946, at the young age of 23, just one year after the end of World War II. Mrs. Bertha, intrigued by the mysterious soldier, would leave a flower for him every time she would visit the cemetery. This became a family tradition that endures even after her death, carried with love by Bertha's family. Recently, one of her grandsons took on the task of investigating the origins of this unknown soldier. Join us in a trip through Mexico, United States and Northern Ireland which will unveil the amazing story of Edmond.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198127</url></doc>
