<plot>This wonderful film belongs to the class known as mystifying or illusion films. A magician produces before the audience a small automaton figure of a clown, which he places upon a pedestal, whereupon the figure begins to grow, as he passes his hand in front of it, until it is full life size; when it at once comes to life and endeavors to quarrel with the magician. He, however, with the aid of a heavy sledge hammer, gradually reduces the figure to its original size. One of the most interesting films ever presented.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109173</url></doc>
