<plot>"Here's one of those bold daylight robbers you read about. In steals the villain, mask, dark lantern, jimmy, hand-drill and full outfit. Sees the solid looking safe, starts to drill out the combination. Hears some one coming and hides. Office boy comes in briskly with a coal scuttle, opens safe and discloses coal bin inside. Fills his scuttle, shuts safe door with a slam and goes out. This is the well known scene in 'The Parlor Match,' made famous by Evans and Hoey. The burglar during this episode is a sight to behold. Curiosity, surprise, rage, mortification and disgust seize him, and he slinks away, a crestfallen man. The whole affair is very laughable, the disclosure of coal in a safe being sure to make a great outburst of genuine merriment."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546601</url></doc>
