<plot>Bombay-based Usha Sinha lives a wealthy lifestyle with her widowed dad, a retired Colonel. During her birthday celebration at her grandmother's in Lucknow, she encounters a flirt, but avoids him, only to run into him again in a taxi-cab, and then in her very own house in Bombay. She finds out that his name is Suresh, who has been hired by her dad as a Manager. Eventually both she and Suresh fall in love with each other. Suresh appears to care a lot about Usha and even takes her to a doctor for a medical check-up to ensure her well-being, to which she agrees, without knowing that she has brain tumor and is not expected to live more than one year. What the Sinhas do not know is that Suresh does not love Usha at all, for his true love is a Lucknow-based woman named Rajani, and he is merely here to win their trust, so that he can be successful in robbing them of all their cash and valuables.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168381</url></doc>
