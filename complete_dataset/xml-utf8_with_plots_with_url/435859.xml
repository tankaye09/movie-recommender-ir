<plot>Attorney Thomas Wyatt never thought he would see Waco again. But a routine trial brings him back for a weekend of unpleasant revelations. A crumbling relationship with his girlfriend Daphne Harper is disrupted by the appearance of Moira Farris, his troubled former girlfriend. Her erratic behavior destroys Wyatt's delicate barrier of self delusion, the only thing preventing him from succumbing to the vices of his past: alcoholism and complacency. His good friends Jason and Diane Nordstrom attempt to prevent his descent into self destruction, but even they find themselves increasingly entangled in Wyatt's burgeoning breakdown. When Daphne flees her own difficulties in Austin to find Wyatt, the emotional turmoil comes to a head, culminating in a night that will scar them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435859</url></doc>
