<plot>This 6-part fly-on-the-wall documentary charts English football club Sunderland AFC throughout the 1996/97 Premier League season, as the newly promoted club tries to avoid relegation. It also follows the building of the club's new multi-million pound stadium: "The Stadium of Light". The documentary team had access to the players, fans and backroom staff at the club, giving Sunderland fans and general sport fans a fascinating insight as to how a club is ran. Narrated by Sunderland-born actress "Gina McKee", the show was made famous in the UK due to manager Peter Reid's half-time swearing tirades.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442430</url></doc>
