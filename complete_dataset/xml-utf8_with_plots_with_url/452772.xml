<plot>Kedarnath Bhargav, his wife, Laxmi, and two sons, Ram and Lakshman are homeless. While traveling, their train derails and the family is separated into 3 groups. While Laxmi works as a maidservant in the house of Bombay's Mayor and his daughter, Rekha; Ram has been abducted by a career criminal, and Kedarnath &amp; Lakshman are together. Ratanlal Verma, a kind-hearted man, with a son named Prakash comes to Lakshman's rescue, is run over by a truck, and becomes a cripple. Kedarnath and Lakshman re-locate to Ratanlal's village, Raampur, and they live together as one family. Years later, Prakash has grown up, and has re-located to Bombay, where he finds employment with a jeweler. When Ratanlal does not hear from him for 2 months, they ask Lakshman to go to Bombay and ensure that Prakash is alright. Upon arrival in Bombay, Lakshman finds out that Prakash has been arrested by the Police for killing a man named Kundan Kumar, he is subsequently found guilty, and sentenced to be hanged. Lakshman takes it upon himself to find out who actually killed Kundan, and dons the guise of Louis D'Souza and gets himself enrolled in the Serpent Gang. What Lakshman does not know is that the leader of this gang is Kumar, who is none other than Ram, and when he finds out he must make a choice - either to save Prakash from the gallows or turn his very own brother in - to be hanged until death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452772</url></doc>
