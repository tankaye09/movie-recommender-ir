<plot>"A remarkably fine picture of two companies of Royal Canadian militia returning from field practice. The men have discarded their showy dress uniforms, and march with sleeves rolled up and blouses discarded. Part of the company appear as sappers and miners, and another as a Gatling Gun squad. The men are exceedingly well set up, and present a very formidable appearance. Lieut.-Col. Otter, who commanded the First Canadian Contingent to South Africa reviews the troops as they march by. The picture is very fine photographically."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261606</url></doc>
