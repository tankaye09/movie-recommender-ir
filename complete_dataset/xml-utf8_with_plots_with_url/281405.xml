<plot>Manas lives a comfortable upper middle-class life with his mother in a palatial house. His mother would like him to get married to a pretty girl named Vidya. But Manas has other plans, for he does not care for romance, sex, and love, as he considers them a waste of time and energy. He, therefore, spends his time in inventing a computer that will perform all those tasks, leaving the humans to carry on working without having to indulge in sex and giving birth to babies. His devout Hindu mother is appalled at this, and would like him to discontinue this research immediately, but Manas refuses to do so. Due to his refusal, his mother suffers a heart-attack and is bed-ridden. Ashamed at hurting his mother, Manas repents by marrying Vidya. After the marriage, there is considerable acrimony within their household, as Manas suspects Vidya is having an affair with an old flame by the name of Prabhat. This suspicion gathers momentum when he finds them together, and they separate. Manas then goes on with his research for the perfect computer to replace sex. What Vidya and Manas' mom do not know that Manas is being manipulated and controlled by a devilish force - a force that will not rest until it has enslaved all of humanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281405</url></doc>
