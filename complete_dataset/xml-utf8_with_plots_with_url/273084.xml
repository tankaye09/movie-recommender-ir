<plot>Jakobsen lives in a home for the elderly after his wife passed away. His days are spent watching TV or playing bingo, which Jakobsen does not appreciate. However, what he appreciates the least is his roommate, who is annoying, to say the least. One night, Jakobsen runs away dressed only in his pyjamas. He steals a spray can, and becomes a graffiti artist for one night!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273084</url></doc>
