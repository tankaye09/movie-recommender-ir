<plot>"An excellent picture of the protected cruiser type. The 'Cincinnati' is about 300 feet in length, and as she swings at anchor at the Dry Tortugas, she presents a magnificent spectacle. From the main mast floats the American flag, and from the forward tops are swung the signal lanterns. Her death dealing guns seem to point directly at our camera. The massive barbettes, turrets and armored belt look invulnerable. A sailor at the stern is signaling to the 'Indiana' close by. He frantically waves a blue flag, white square in the center (P in the International Code.) Several small boats moving in the foreground lend action to the scene. A very interesting subject."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119775</url></doc>
