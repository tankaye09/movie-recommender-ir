<plot>With the planned Exhumation of Mr. Bertram Fletcher Robinson's body in 2007 to examine it for poisoning, the worlds Media awaits the results of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's involvements in a real life Crime; one even Sherlock Holmes would have struggled with. Did Doyle, under pressure to save England's King Edward VII from abdication for Knighting the wrong Author of The Hound of the Baskervilles, risk a potential hanging on the Gallows? The evidence recovered over the past 19 years is both compelling and extraordinary. Love, Hate, retribution, marriages and Funerals, the Boar War, the Paris Motor Show, Rolls Royce and the most influential Newspaper Editors in Victorian and Edwardian history, play substantial parts in this amazing crime-riddled misrepresentation of English Upper Crust Society, so many surprises covering up for Murder to protect a fiction writers reputation.
