<plot>Young Bishan Kumar lives a wealthy lifestyle with his widowed mom, his best friend, Kishan, a former servant cum cook, and both are virtually inseparable. Bishan's uncle was partly responsible for his dad's death, and after serving a long prison sentence, begs his sister to forgive him, which she does, and he, along with his son, Jagdish, move in to the house. He convinces his sister to permit Bishan to go to Bombay for further studies, and then abroad also. Years later, Bishan returns home to renew his friendship bond with Kishan, and also introduce him to his wife, Sheela, and son, Munna. When Bishan finds out that Kishan has a golden voice, he wants him to start training in Bombay with Bharatji, which Kishan reluctantly does. After he finishes his training, he goes forth with his first concert, which is a huge success and becomes a star overnight. It is then he finds out that Bishan has lost everything, his wife and son have left him, and his uncle and cousin had embezzled all the money. Kishan uses his only asset, his voice, to restore Bishan's glory only to find out that a desperate Bishan has abducted a group of school-girls, abroad a yacht that he used to own, demanding huge ransoms from their respective parents. Subsequently, Kishan learns that Bishan is dead. Unable to handle this shock, Kishan loses his mental balance and is hospitalized. The question remains, what compelled Bishan to abduct the school-girls, and how did Bishan actually die?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663449</url></doc>
