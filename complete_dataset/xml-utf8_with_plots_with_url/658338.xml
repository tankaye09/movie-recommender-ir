<plot>Winter, a burnt out, self destructive contract killer is on her way to a new assignment when Josh, her long time lover and partner, tries to persuade her to give up her career. Josh was in the business himself, and sees something in Winter that could compromise their life, but she struggles to come to grips with his honesty. Meanwhile complications arise with the mark, Sir Charles Barton, a member of the British parliament who has stolen twenty-two million dollars, discovers that the money is gone. Double-crossed by one of his cronies, Sir Charles spins out-of-control and hires an escort specialized in sado-masochistic sex. But the call is intercepted, and when Winter shows up disguised as the call girl, the game begins. Inevitably, Winter comes face to face with her own mortality as she struggles with the concept of something deeper, something that could change her. And after today, she may never be the same again. But for now it's too late to turn back, and blood will have to flow one way or another.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658338</url></doc>
