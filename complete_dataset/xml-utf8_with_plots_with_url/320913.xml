<plot>Scott was on his way to work shooting a documentary in Midtown Manhattan on September 11th. After realizing what had happened and unsure what else to do he began capturing the events unfolding around him. Later that week he put the scenes together in an effort to wrap his head around it all. What resulted is a stirring and emotional reflection of that day and his experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320913</url></doc>
