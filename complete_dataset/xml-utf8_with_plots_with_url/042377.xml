<plot>Principal Satyaprakash is a decent middle-class man who manages a co-ed college. He witnesses his daughter, Pooja, being molested by Kali, the son of gangster Dhabla, objects to this behavior, but is silenced by Dhabla. Pooja is in love with a young man named Raja. One day Pooja is sexually assaulted by Kali and a group of his friends, who then throw her to her death from the roof of an under-construction building. Raja witnesses this, and reports this to the police. Inspector Shirke instead charges Raja for this crime. Pooja's brother, Vijay, finds out and attempts to try and put a stop to this injustice. Shortly thereafter Raja is killed, and Vijay is charged for killing him and held in a cell. The charge against Vijay is that he killed Raja out of anger for molesting his sister, a charge that may carry the death sentence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042377</url></doc>
