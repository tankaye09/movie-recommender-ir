<plot>Gopal Mohanto lives a wealthy lifestyle in Guwahati along with his adoptive parents Mr. Mohanto and Gayetri. Gayetri is often cruel to him, and he runs away from home straight to Bombay. There he meets some youth in his age group and starts earning money delivering newspapers under the supervision of Badru. One day he finds some money belonging to a Bollywood actress named Shalini. He returns the money to her, she thanks and he starts to think that she maybe his biological mother. He asks Badru to let him deliver newspapers, to which Badru agrees. Gopal now hopes to convince Shalini that she is his mother - but will an established and single actress be willing to take such a risk - even if it is true?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349718</url></doc>
