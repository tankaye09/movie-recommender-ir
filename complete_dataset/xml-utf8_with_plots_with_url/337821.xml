<plot>Two young heroin addicts, recently released from prison - both are desperate to "get off the gear". But poverty and boredom in their home town in North England means that it is only a matter of time before they slip back into the cycle of addiction and crime. Michelle, forced into prostitution by the age of 13, now lacks the support she needs to stay off heroin. Shaun, on the other hand, has his mother, Angela,who will do anything to protect him, until his steady relapse becomes too much for her to bear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337821</url></doc>
