<plot>In order to reduce the tense relationship between India and Pakistan, the two governments decide to hold a "Goodwill One Day International Cricket Match" in Srinagar, Northern India. The Indian government decides that it will lose face if it allows any terrorist activity to take place during this game. In charge of security is Inspector Victor Anthony, whose son wants an autograph of each player from both India and Pakistan, who realizes his responsibility and the magnitude of the assignment he faces. India's top eleven are lead by Captain Sunny, a disgruntled and demoralized man, who is unable to get any respect from the rest of his team, which includes a new-comer by the name of Siddharth Srivastav. In the background, TV news-reporter Aparna Sen takes care of the local mood and scenario, in a region that could easily erupt in violence, led by separatists and terrorists, who will stop at nothing to disrupt this "Goodwill Match".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496830</url></doc>
