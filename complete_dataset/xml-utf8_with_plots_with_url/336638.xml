<plot>A breakfast table with a bit of a bowl in the foreground. Behind this a woman, Lili, her head isn't in shot and she's hardly in the frame, but she speaks. Her words are accompanied by the movement of her hands, making suggestive gestures, like a mime. The fingers in the centre of the image are nervous, the discourse is agitated, Lili is doing some private psychoanalysis. As is usual in the Bartolomeo, we come into the middle of a conversation, an exchange that confronts the soliloquy of a woman and the autism of a "man with a camera".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336638</url></doc>
