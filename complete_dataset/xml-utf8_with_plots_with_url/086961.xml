<plot>Here is seen a bold, bad burglar who, after examining the room thoroughly, hears footsteps and crawls under the bed. It happens to be the boudoir of an old maid who enters and proceeds to disrobe, beginning by taking off her wig, and follows by false teeth, etc.; she finally lands in bed but is annoyed by a noise underneath and peering under discovers the burglar. She captures his pistol and forces him to get up, and after seeing that the door is securely locked, she pulls him down on her lap and almost devours him with her caresses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086961</url></doc>
