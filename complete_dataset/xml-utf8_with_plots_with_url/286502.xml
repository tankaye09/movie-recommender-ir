<plot>A unique collaboration between acclaimed young British writer &amp; director Greg Hall and critically renowned composer &amp; musician Steve Martland. "KAPITAL" (2007) is a Gothic and uncompromising look at the darker crevasses of human nature and society. Following a cross section of characters lives, inter weaved in a mosaic form over the turbulent course of one day, as they all deal with the demons and angels that haunt their harsh realities. An apocalyptic vision of modern day existence. This highly anticipated film follows critical acclaim for Greg Hall's debut "THE PLAGUE" (2004), whose no-budget production and ensuing success was described by "VARIETY" as a "Cinderella Story", picking up three awards as it screened globally at Film Festivals and gained a trail blazing reputation - "One of the most explosive pieces of British cinema ever!" Notably he was the inaugural winner of the Katrin Cartlidge Foundation Prize awarded by Mike Leigh at the 10th Sarajevo Film Festival 2004. Originally commissioned as the only film piece by the biennial Manchester International Festival, created as the World's first original commissioning festival, "KAPITAL" was premiered on 4th July 2007 alongside work by some of the Worlds most respected artists in their fields including Ennio Morricone, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Philippe Parreno and Lou Reed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?286502</url></doc>
