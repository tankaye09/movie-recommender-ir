<plot>At a time when most Americans were recovering from the shock of the 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre some people saw an opportunity to make money. Some of them were those with shares in the arms and oil industries but others were just normal people. This documentary looks at several people who tried to claim that their partners had died as the buildings fell down, looking at the impact they had on their families and communities and in some cases talking to the people themselves to find out their motivations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?538679</url></doc>
