<plot>Convenience is the story of a young man faced with choices. He still lives in the small town he grew up in, working the same job he held in high school with the same friends at his side. Through his searching, dialogs and obstacles presented in his path, he soon learns to face the existence that has been chosen for him and make a choice of his own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114860</url></doc>
