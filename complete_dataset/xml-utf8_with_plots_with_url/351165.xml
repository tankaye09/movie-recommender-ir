Hamsa likes Sanjay immensely and proposes to marry him. Sanjay too accepts the proposal. In a casual chitchat, Sanjay reveals that he does not love her though he is marrying her. He feels that it is a marriage of convenience. Sanjay's confession hurts Hamsa and she cancels the alliance. As Sanjay slowly realizes the power of love and starts missing her, Hamsa becomes pragmatic and practical by ignoring his pleas for forgiveness.
