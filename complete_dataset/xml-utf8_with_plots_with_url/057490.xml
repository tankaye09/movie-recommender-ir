<plot>Police Inspector Vijay lives a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay, India, along with his Bua, while his widower dad lives in the countryside in a farmhouse. Vijay meets and falls in love with Uma, who subsequently moves in as a tenant in his Bua's house along with her dad, Jagmohan and her mom. When Jagmohan finds out that Uma also loves Vijay he forbids her to see him, but subsequently relents when she poisons herself. Both Vijay and Uma get married and shortly thereafter give birth to a girl and name her Pinky. When bandits stop a wedding party bus on the Bombay-Poona Highway, loot, sexually molest females, and kill several passengers, Vijay is asked to investigate. His eventually arrests a Hotel Manager named Ranga, who colluded with the bandits, but Advocate Ghaswala successfully defends him and gets him acquitted resulting in the killing of the only eye-witness, a 10 year old boy. In retaliation Vijay beats up and kills Ranga, which results in him getting suspended from the Police Force. Then Vijay starts getting threats and has a bomb planted in his house. The panic-stricken family flee to the farmhouse, but bandits locate them there also and forcibly abduct Uma and Pinky after assaulting Prem. Vijay must now rush to save his wife and daughter, but the question remains will he be able to reach them on time?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057490</url></doc>
