<plot>This scene opens in one of the wide Parisian plazas at the Paris Exposition. Several troops of Lancers and French Dragoons are mounted and draw up in the line ready to make an exhibition cavalry charge. They begin by charging away from the camera for a distance of about half a mile, when they halt, and facing toward the camera they make a most pleasing spectacle as they gallop back toward the audience at a furious rate of speed. There are about 500 men abreast in this most remarkable cavalry charge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222251</url></doc>
