<plot>After the death of his grandmother in February 2008, Writer/Director Joe McClean decided to make ANOTHER DAY in her memory, spreading the advise to anyone suffering from a loss, that the best advice is to keep putting "one foot in front of the other." Another Day follows Todd through an average day in the life of an apartment manager/handyman in Nashville. He wakes up alone. He takes a shower. He goes to work. He takes care of business. He goes to bed. The next morning he wakes up to do it all over again, but not before reading a note left by a woman he loved and lost. The note was written on her death bed as she watched Todd watching her die. She tells him in the note to just keep moving on and one day time will heal all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042002</url></doc>
