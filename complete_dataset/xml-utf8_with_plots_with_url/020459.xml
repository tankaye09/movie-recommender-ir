<plot>Jhoomri and her husband, Bhimsha, move into a new neighbourhood. Their immediate neighbours are three squabbling couples, namely Vijay and Anjali who are newly married; Appu Khote and Vimla, who are married and have 4 children; and Ravi and Meena, who are also married and have one child. With their wages unable to keep up with inflation and high cost of living, unable to pay even rent to the landlord, B.K. Kakkad, the wives decide to seek employment to augment their income, with hilarious results from their spouses, who will go to any extent to keep their wives at home, even if means to bring a dancing girl home to cook and look after the children!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020459</url></doc>
