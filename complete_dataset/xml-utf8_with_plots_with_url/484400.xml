<plot>Bluto the blacksmith gets a draft notice. Popeye is in charge of the local draft board. Bluto gives a sob story about his ailments, but makes a miraculous recovery when Popeye's gorgeous "secretary" appears (really a 1000 pound weight in disguise). Bluto, desperate, dives out the skyscraper window; Popeye tries to catch him, but they both plummet through the sidewalk, and the devil chases them back out of hell. Bluto dashes into traffic, but the car suffers more. He then drops a safe on his head, but ends up inside, along with Popeye. Bluto tosses the safe (with Popeye) into an orphanage, where Japanese are plotting in secret. Bluto shows up in time to help, but they're quickly overpowered, so Popeye shares his spinach with Bluto and they team up; their American fist is then felt overseas by both Hirohito and Hitler. Bluto signs up, but he needs help spelling his name.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484400</url></doc>
