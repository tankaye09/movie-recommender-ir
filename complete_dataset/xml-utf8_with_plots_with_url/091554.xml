<plot>Craig Claiborne, New York Times food editor, conducts a tour of the kitchens and professional personnel in New York City's famous restaurant The Four Seasons. He takes the camera through the processes of preparing an ideal meal for New Year's. With chef Joseph Rengli, and Paul Kovi, co-owner of The Four Seasons. The day begins with deliveries of raw materials at 7am, and ends many hours later when a waiter lifts a huge tray over his head and pushes open the doors to the main dining room. Claiborne tracks many steps, including fish preparation, the chocolate room, and the relationship between chief chefs, sub-chefs, assistants and clean-up employees. The featured meal for this day is: clear consomm√© (from marrow), whole striped bass (skinned and baked in pastry), roast rack of lamb with snow peas, Bibb lettuce salad, European cheese tray, puree of tangerine topped with whipped cream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091554</url></doc>
