<plot>Major Balbir Singh Sodhi (Amitabh Bachchan) attempts to kill the Indian Home Minister Veer Bhadra Singh (Danny Denzongpa) but is unsuccessful. He has been identified, and the army is on the look-out for him to court-martial him. They suspect that he has assumed a new identity, that of Devraj Hathoda alias Dadabhai. Major Ajit Arya (Nana Patekar) is assigned the task to investigate this, and he successfully manages to lure Balbir into admitting his true identity. Then Balbir clarifies to Ajit what his motive was behind his assasination attempts on the life of the Home Minister, and Ajit decides to join forces with Balbir to expose the Home Minister. Then terrorist Ghafoor Changezi announces that no worshipper will be permitted to visit the Holy Shrine of Mata Sheravali during the Navratri Fest, and the Home Minister accepts the challenge, in order to make himself even more popular. Balbir and Ajit must now act to stop the terrorists, little do they realize that the Home Minister and terrorist Changezi's agenda is one and the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?295371</url></doc>
