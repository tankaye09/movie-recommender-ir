<plot>A parody of game shows such as "Family Feud." Contestants from two towns (with real names of small towns in Canada) play assorted games, including "The Wheel of Different Things" (which is rigged) and "Shameless Plug" (where the town makes a creative presentation showcasing their town). The winner is declared "Supertown" for a week. The contestants are played by actors, and their characteristics poke fun at the town they represent (eg. a character from a town in PEI worked in an Anne of Green Gables gift shop). Dick is obviously infatuated with Gwen, trying to impress her constantly, and she rejects all of his advances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522860</url></doc>
