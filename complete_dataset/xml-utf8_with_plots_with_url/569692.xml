<plot>The LAPD, not knowing what to do with their weirdos, decide to put them in one precinct. Among these individuals King who likes to makes himself look like Elvis, Mel the sexy cop who use to be a guy, and Price Pascal who is basically a good cop but unfortunately has a thing for the ladies and unfortunately for him one his conquests turned out to be mayor's underaged daughter. Now Price and the rest of the gang constantly find themselves butting heads with the sheriff's department; it seems that they get the bust that the Sheriff's department was working on and Ronald Hobbs the Lieutenant of the Sheriff's department always seems to lose all the girls he is interested to Price. Presently they were working on busting a drug ring but when Hobbs and his crew interfered it went all wrong. Hobbs complained that it was there fault, so the city is considering closing down the Precinct and dismissing them from the department. So they have to try do something that will convince the chief that they are not the incompetents that he thinks they are.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569692</url></doc>
