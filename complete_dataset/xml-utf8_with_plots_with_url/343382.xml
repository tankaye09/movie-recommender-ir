<plot>During the Reagan era, as Wall Street's culture of greed and the Moral Majority culture of conservatism were establishing their strangle-hold on American culture, something was bubbling in the basements, garages, and rock clubs of America. Bands like Black Flag, The Replacements, Minutemen, Husker Du, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, and REM were continuing to build a rabid following among disaffected suburban youth and plugged-in college students. Within a few years, this grassroots D.I.Y music scene would completely spill over into the mainstream, where it remains today. This is the setting for LOSERS TAKE ALL, a comedy in which we follow "The Fingers," a fictional punk-pop band stumbling and staggering their way in the opposite direction of mainstream success, circa 1986. What they lack in polish, discipline, and talent they make up for in raw energy, integrity and spirit, which attracts a loyal local following, as well as the services of an inept, but well-meaning band manager. Despite their early struggles, The Fingers cut a promising demo, which scores them a record deal with the leading independent label of the day. Loading their gear in a beat up van, they hit the road touring. Propelled by word of mouth, a network of xeroxed fanzines, college radio, and their high-octane live shows, the Fingers are soon living their dream. But true to form, they manage to blow their big chance, and lose all of their equipment and credibility in the process. With help coming from the least likely of places, the band finds themselves back on stage and, as major record labels begin to smell dollars in the burgeoning underground music scene, the Fingers are faced with the unlikely opportunity of committing the ultimate indie sin: selling out. Do they stay true to their non-commercial DIY sound and ethos? Do they get in bed with corporate rock? Or do they simply keep getting wasted and implode into oblivion?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343382</url></doc>
