<plot>David Conroy, novelist fighting a looming deadline. An unfortunate fall has left him in a wheelchair for several weeks. He's confined himself to his living room, much to his wife Laura's dismay, ostensibly to work on his novel, and keep himself occupied, unable to roll very far. It is from this living room window, with its view of Conroy's neighbor Tom Mitchell's garden. Our story takes a turn late one night during a particularly difficult bout of writer's block. Conroy notices something strange about the garden gnomes on the lawn across the street. As he watches them, he is more and more convinced. They're up to something.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217589</url></doc>
