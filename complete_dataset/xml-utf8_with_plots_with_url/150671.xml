<plot>Over a two-hour dinner at a swanky Beverly Hills restaurant, the world-famous Kids of Widney High improvise a series of interweaving vignettes. Cain takes over as the ever-present "everyman" of the restaurant, acting as Manager/Chef/Waiter/Bar Tender, seating the rest of the Kids at their tables, and tending to their needs. Peewee and Elisa argue over whether or not they'll be attending a high school reunion for Elisa, as Peewee grows more and more inebriated and apoplectic as the night progresses. Meanwhile, Fabian and Matty are on a blind date in which Matty is talkative and a bit too intimate for the taciturn and introverted Fabian. No Beverly Hills restaurant would be complete without its annoying celebrity presence, which is exactly the role Tanesa fills, as an obnoxious engenue on her cell phone, endlessly jabbering to her agent, boyfriends, other filmmakers, et al... across the table from poor Shelly who's a recent film school graduate (winner of the coveted "best film student award") who has the opportunity to make his debut feature with Tanesa. If only she'd get off her cell phone... All the time, Darrell raps, dances, plays the recorder, and strums his guitar outside the restaurant, until Cain comes out to eject him from the area. The night presses on with heated tensions, broken promises, a few laughs, some heartfelt moments of redemption, and a fight scene that rivals OUT FOR JUSTICE.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150671</url></doc>
