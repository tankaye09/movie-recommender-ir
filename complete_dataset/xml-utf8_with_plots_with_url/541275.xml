<plot>Two small boys have constructed a device over a fence camouflaged by a poster. A rose is painted on the poster as well as the words "The Automatic Weather Prophet." Three people are intrigued by the sign. One is a large fat man who attempts to catch the two boys but is unable to get through the narrow slot in the fence.
