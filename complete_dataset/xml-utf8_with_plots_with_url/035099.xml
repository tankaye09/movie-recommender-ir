<plot>What if Darren Aronofsky's "Pi" were crossed with the Weitz brothers' "American Pie"? In black and white, computer geek Max squirrels away in his room, studying pi in hopes it will disclose to him the secret of sexual fulfillment. Meanwhile, his high school prom is two weeks away, and, in full color, his buddies are encouraging him to score with somebody, maybe Michelle, a student who seems to like him. Max consults the Jewish elders, he seeks enlightenment in kugel, he tutors Nadia in his bedroom. With the prom less than 3.1416 days away, will Max find insight?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035099</url></doc>
