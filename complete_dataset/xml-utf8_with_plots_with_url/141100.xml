<plot>Derby in Black is an American sports history snapshot that examines the numerous and significant contributions Black Americans made to the horse racing industry from the late 1800s to present. This insightful documentary examines the overall impact the early Black jockeys had on the sport and society when they became consistent champions of the annual Kentucky Derby, the most famous horse race in the world. Derby in Black candidly discusses how and why the involvement of Black jockeys, Black trainers and Black owners have gradually decreased in the sport over the past several decades with some of horse racing's top participants, including today's only Black jockey to have ridden in the Kentucky Derby in nearly 80 years. Derby in Black takes an informative glimpse into this fascinating slice of American sports.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?141100</url></doc>
