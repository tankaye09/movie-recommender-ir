<plot>Set in a Vietnamese populated Sydney suburb, Ra Choi is the story of four street kids down on their luck and trying to make a life for themselves. It's a moving and emotional journey where the strength of the human spirit is often the only hope they have in their intertwined lives. Each is on a path of discovery, fighting for a level of existence that most of us take for granted; a roof over their head, a warm meal, new clothes, a job. Every city has its heartbreaking stories and these young lives hit levels of desperation that we pray no one ever has to reach. Ra Choi, is a Vietnamese expression, which translated means "Coming out to play." It refers to the immersion into street life. Dac Kien, Lahn, Trinh and Lucy and their friends are more than just kids on the street. They are family who cannot survive without each other's support. They will soon discover the true meaning of friendship and loyalty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452720</url></doc>
