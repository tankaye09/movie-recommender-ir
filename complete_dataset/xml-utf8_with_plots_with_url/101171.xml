<plot>Surviving against the odds... it's the stuff from which great movies are made. But some true tales are more miraculous than fiction. Men and women who face down death and live to tell about it: A man is run over by a train...someone else spends 76 days lost at sea - a snow skier is buried alive for 22 hours, a famous supermodel survives a snowy mountain-top helicopter crash. Whether it involves celebrities or everyday people, these stories captivate the media and eventually become legend. Over the next two hours, we'll bring these heroes back to life, as we count down: 15 Incredible Survival Stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101171</url></doc>
