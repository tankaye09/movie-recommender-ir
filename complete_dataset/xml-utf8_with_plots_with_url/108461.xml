<plot>A college girl tests her fiance buying him a puppy after reading an article that states the way a man treats his dog is the way he will treat his children, as a condition for their marriage. A woman, middle-age, seeks the advice of a marriage therapist to face a dilemma: great husband, child, job and life, except she is unhappy: is marriage dead? can she really stay in a relationship for 30 more years? What are the real issues facing women today? A colege male is faced with a dilemma: he has the girl of his dreams, but has only been with one woman prior. Does he cheat, leave her, or stay selling himself out? His father shocks him with an answer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108461</url></doc>
