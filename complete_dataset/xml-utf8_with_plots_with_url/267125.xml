<plot>Interrogation is a Kafkaesque short film that looks at what normally would be a very logical process. But this interrogation is far from the norm. Neither interrogator nor suspect seem to know exactly what is going on. The "who's on first" conversation seems to go nowhere until the truth is finally revealed. Interrogation is a look into nothing and thankfully nothing is truly accomplished. Only through looking past everything can you truly see the absolute nothing that is the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267125</url></doc>
