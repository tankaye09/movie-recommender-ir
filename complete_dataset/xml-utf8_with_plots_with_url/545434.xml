<plot>Carl's been driving through the night, and when radio preachers can't keep him awake, he pulls over and goes into the Liberty Diner. All the customers turn and stare at him. He sits down at a corner table, asks the indifferent waitress if he can still order breakfast, and he wants coffee. She suggests 'the bottomless cup.' He orders it. One customer plays the same song repeatedly on the jukebox; the others keep staring. After the Tex-Mex breakfast and several cups of java, when Carl's ready to hit the road, complications arise. Can he finish what he started? Is there liberty at the Liberty Diner?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545434</url></doc>
