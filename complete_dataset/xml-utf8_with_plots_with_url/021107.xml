<plot>Reiner Linden used to run 15 Cocktailbars in Cologne,Germany for more than 15 years. Shortly before his 40th birthday, he decides to change his life. He sells the bars, moves to Sazburg, Austria and gets married. He decides to do something, that involves sport, nature and adventure. He buys 11 dirt bikes and offers guided tours through Bosnia and Coatia (former Yogoslavia). His clients love him because he has found trails were people can ride legally through beautiful landscapes on their motorbikes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021107</url></doc>
