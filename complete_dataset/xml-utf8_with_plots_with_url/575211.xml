<plot>In a small New Zealand town, 16 year-old Michael leads a lonely, introverted existence with his single mother Amelia whose guilt and alcoholism threatens to drive her cherished son away. Uncomfortable with the adolescent exploits of his "friends," he finds escape through a passionate love of maps. Unexpected friendships with classmate Alison, whose sweetness and innocence belie a dark secret, and Mary, a blind young woman on the cusp of adulthood, rouse Michael from his isolation and send him on a journey of self-discovery. As his life begins to spiral out of control, Michael is forced into some difficult choices about his future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575211</url></doc>
