<plot>Herb, a butcher, brings spoiled leftovers home just to make ends meet. Herb's wife wants a baby. In his never-ending battle to get ahead, Herb, a compulsive gambler, hits the dog- fights, but forever stands on the wrong side of the wager. With a staggering mob debt and a wife insisting on a family, Herb receives more bad news. A child, possibly his, will soon arrive on his doorstep. With another mouth to feed, Herb places larger bets and takes larger losses. Collectors arrive to call in the note and Herb is in way over his head. When pressed, it becomes clear that the most valuable thing in his life is the anonymous boy. A boy that is worth more for his organs than he is alive. A boy that no one would miss. Except Herb's wife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424550</url></doc>
