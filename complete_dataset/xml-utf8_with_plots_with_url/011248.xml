<plot>A man and his wife are quarreling in the garden when a policeman jumps over the wall and interferes. The couple immediately set upon the policeman and give him a severe beating. When he is well laid out they throw him over the wall. The opposite side of the wall is then shown. The policeman lands heavily, and after picking himself up with difficulty goes away, followed by the jeers of the couple, whose heads appear on the top of the wall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011248</url></doc>
