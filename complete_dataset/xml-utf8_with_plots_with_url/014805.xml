<plot>"A catboat is shown in the foreground, and from it a young man and woman are diving and swimming about in the clean water. A second pretty young woman in a summer gown is taking her ease on the stern of the boat, when a sudden lurch by the bathers causes her to slip from her place and to fall headlong into the water. She makes the best of the accident, however, and climbs back on the boat laughing at her plight."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014805</url></doc>
