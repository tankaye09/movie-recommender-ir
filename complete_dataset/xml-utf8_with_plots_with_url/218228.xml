<plot>Bruce thought he had everything. A stable life, a beautiful girlfriend. But he still felt dead inside. And he found himself at a crossroads, with no idea what to do with the rest of his life. Lily had always been told she was crazy. Most people saw her as naive and childish. But she'd managed to get into a major college, far away from her old life. And she'd met a nice guy, Bruce, who she knew liked her ... though his girlfriend would never approve of that. Rhonda was worried. She was deeply in love with Bruce, but had never felt secure with him. He was immature, for one thing, irrational and silly. But her main worry was that in a college relationship, nothing lasts forever. Will he just pack up and leave after graduation? Would he pack up and leave her now? Why couldn't he just give her a straight answer? And what the hell was he doing with that Lily girl anyway? People always told Clifford he was funny. Even women thought he was funny. But they didn't want to go out with him. Heather was all he had. And now she was gone. And he tried to pretend he didn't miss her. But he missed her more than he would miss air or water, if that was gone. Even though he now found himself falling for Lily ... And then one day something ... unexplainable happened. Bruce called it a miracle. Lily was just glad to be alive. And they suddenly realized how small their problems were in comparison to the vastness of ... whatever is out there. And they started to wonder if there was a higher purpose in store for them, a fate that neither of them could avoid ...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218228</url></doc>
