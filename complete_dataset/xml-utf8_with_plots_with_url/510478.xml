<plot>MOVING UP is a tragicomic story about the psychologist Manfred who suffers from strong inferiority complexes. Manfred is a senior lecturer at the Institute of Psychology at a Danish university. He is ambitious and strives for success and recognition from his surroundings, but he is tormented by a feeling of being invisible and underestimated. When a prestigious professorship at his university becomes vacant, Manfred sees an opportunity to obtain the recognition and fame he has been longing for. But from his striving towards success arises a paranoid (mis)conception that everybody around him are trying to destroy his possibilities. Manfred gives battle and will stop at nothing to reach his goal. He wants to become a professor at any price.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510478</url></doc>
