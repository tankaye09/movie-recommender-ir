<plot>In a variation of "The Treasure of Sierra Madre," a pair of acquaintances botch their shot at the big time in this stylish noir crime-drama. Ross (Andrew Roperto) and Martin (Richmond Arquette) are two barflys looking for a bigger score. They've become regulars at Mr. B's, a former dive-bar turned upscale, where they make the acquaintance of bar regular Dino (Seymour Cassel). Dino is a good-natured drunk, who after a few cocktails, likes to preach advice and show off his briefcase filled with rare and valuable coins. Enter barfly Madeline (Cynda Williams). Ross and Madeline had a short-lived affair but now she's on the arm of Dino and this angers Ross. Martin and Ross steal Dino's briefcase and things quickly go very wrong Dino ends up seriously hurt and Dino's boss, the nefarious Mr. Scholnick (Udo Kier), shows up with his thugs asking a lot of questions. The police start an investigation and Ross and Martin have to figure out how to clear their names as their world spirals out of control.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569228</url></doc>
