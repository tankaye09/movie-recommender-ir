<plot>Winters in New England are short, dark and very cold; and for most New Englanders, the one thing that keeps them going is a sport that has roots deeper than any other - Hockey. NEW ENGLAND HOCKEY: A LIFE AT THE RINK is the story of a close knit sport that is connected by family, tradition and passion. At the very same South Shore Arena, a life at the rink begins with toddlers trying on their first pair of skates and ends with hockey has-beens living for one last game with the guys. Up in Milton, a father balances fatherhood with coaching while his 11 year old son continues a family hockey tradition. Back in Roxbury, Catholic Memorial High School is on target for yet another state title. A backyard rink in Natick is the glue that keeps a family together while at Harvard University, a local hockey hero looks to lead his alma mater back to Beanpot Glory. Finally, at the TD Banknorth Garden, Bruins fans from Section 307 experience another season of Stanley Cup dreams, trade deadline heartbreak and most importantly, a friendship that is stronger than their shared love for the Black and Gold. In New England, Hockey is what you do and the rink is where you live.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394039</url></doc>
