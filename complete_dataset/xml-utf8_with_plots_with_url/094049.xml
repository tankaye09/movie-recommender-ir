<plot>After being sent abroad at the tender age of eight, Virginia returns to Quito, her birthplace, twenty-five years later. She is finally reunited with her widowed father and her fraternal twin sister, Manuela. Her sister lives in their parents' house with her husband and two sons while her father vegetates in a retirement home.
