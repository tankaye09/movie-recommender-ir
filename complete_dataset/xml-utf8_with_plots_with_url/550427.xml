<plot>This is yet another bogus title gleaned from the error-filled pages of The Braff Silent Short Film Working papers by Richard E. Braff. There is no reliable documentation that a film bearing this title with Joyce and Morey was ever produced by Vitagraph or any other company at this time. Most likely the correct title is The Question (1917) q.v.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550427</url></doc>
