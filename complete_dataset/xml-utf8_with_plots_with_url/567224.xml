<plot>The first of three "Scotland Yard Featurettes" released in the US by Paramount in 1954. This one, combined with "Present For a Bride" and "The Final Twist", was also edited together in a feature-length version called "Calling Scotland Yard" for US theatrical bookings in 1954. They later became part of the "Adventure Theatre" TV program. Paul Douglas served as story teller/narrator on all: "Dagger" has the happy home life of an English Peer and his second wife abruptly shattered when the supposedly-dead first wife, Vanda Godsell, shows up to blackmail her successor. The blackmailer is killed in a fight when she accidentally falls on a Javanese dagger, and the second wife is about to be convicted of murder until testimony is brought fourth from an unexpected source.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567224</url></doc>
