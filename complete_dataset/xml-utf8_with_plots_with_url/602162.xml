<plot>In early 2001, DV Cuisine was commissioned by the US and Canadian Food Networks to produce a documentary revolving around the World Pastry Cup, held in Lyon, France on January 21 and 22, 2001. The Canadian competitors Dominique and Cindy Duby came in a very respectable fifth place. The USA competitors Ewald Notter, Michel Willaume and En-Ming Hsu were added to the prestigious winner's circle by capturing the Gold. Each team of three pastry chefs had nine hours to prepare and serve one chocolate showpiece and 16 plated desserts, one sugar showpiece and three chocolate cakes as well as one ice-carving showpiece with three frozen (ice-cream) cakes. Pastry has become a true form of art, as this documentary illustrates. You will be fascinated by the delicate and intriguing work and tremendous craftsmanship of the highest degree.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602162</url></doc>
