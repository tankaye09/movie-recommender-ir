<plot>A film about the Balkan in the second half of the last century, or to be more precise, about a town on the Danube, Braila, where Romanians, Turks and Greeks lived together. The story begins with a family falling apart: the hedonist mother and her children - Kyra and Dragomír- are constantly and scandalously by the father and the third sibling, who live separately. The mother, blinded in one eye, leaves her children, Kyra is kidnapped and sold. Dragomír is left on his own. The 17-year-old boy makes friends with Codin, who is a double murderer and a respected and feared figure of the neighborhood. They become "blood brothers". The rest of the film is about their friendship and the story of Codin's destiny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103918</url></doc>
