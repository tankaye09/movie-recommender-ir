<plot>At the dawn of interstellar reasoning, as the first intelligent races took to the stars and began to interact with each other, they discovered a common thread - the legend of an ancient race that would one day "deliver" the universe. This race was known as the Humans. The Seekers alone held the key to the secret of the humans. Humanity did in fact exist, and the Seekers were doing all that they could to eradicate them. Under the guise of "benevolent explores" they spread methodically through out the galaxy destroying all human life they came in contact with. Consequently, the Seekers did in fact discover many new races and helped introduce them into the galactic arena. This served the Seekers two fold. It allowed them to constantly spread their influence and strengthen their military and civic control of the galaxy, and it allowed them to retain and magnify their image of philanthropic nobility. The Aurelian culture was rich with tales of humanity. When they were discovered by the Seekers many of their legends rekindled long dormant ideals within the galactic senate. With the added insight, knowledge, and technology that interstellar society offered the Aurelian's, it was not long before the Seekers duplicity was discovered. Enraged, the government formed a small covert faction within the Aurelian military to gather as much information about Seeker operations as possible. It was because of this group that Edumea, a small world inhabited by humans, was first discovered and a rescue organized.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024073</url></doc>
