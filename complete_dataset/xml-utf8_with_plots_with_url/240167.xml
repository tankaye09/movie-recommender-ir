<plot>A young man's sister comes over to show him her new baby. He is getting married the next day, so is going to have a bachelor party that night. Before the party, though, he and his friends go to the beach, where he wins a doll at one of the booths. Later, at his bachelor party, people start to think that his sister's baby is actually his, especially when they see him carrying a doll.
