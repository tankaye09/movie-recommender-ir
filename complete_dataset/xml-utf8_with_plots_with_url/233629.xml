<plot>Tracey Moffatt's short film Heaven (1997) is an experimental/art film that compiles home video footage of male surfers posing, surfing, dressing and undressing on Australian beaches. A lot of the footage was filmed by women around Australia, who submitted their tapes to Moffatt, who in turn lovingly compiled the footage, setting it to a soundscape by Felicity Foxx. At times the film is voyeuristic as the subjects of the film have no idea they are being filmed. At other times, the male surfers in question either perform for Moffatt's camera or attempt to resist her prying eyes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233629</url></doc>
