<plot>A meditation on serendipity. A boy's voice, off camera, whispers. He's heard of a place where forgotten objects go, sometimes forever, but sometimes until they're given back. A child sleeps. Outside her room, a solitary man in a suit and topcoat waits and listens. He takes an object from his briefcase, quietly enters the child's room, and places it just under the edge of the mattress. The narrator finds something in the woods. He wonders about the nature of the person the person who places objects where they'll be found. And he thinks about the nature of people, needing this help.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010056</url></doc>
