<plot>After a motorcar has arrived at its destination, the passengers get out, leaving their coats with the driver, who puts them in the car. Shortly afterwards, the driver meets a female friend, and walks off with her. With the car unattended, some rough-looking characters come up to the car, take the clothes, and drive off in the car. Seeing what has happened, the car's driver jumps on a motor-bike and hurries after them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657541</url></doc>
