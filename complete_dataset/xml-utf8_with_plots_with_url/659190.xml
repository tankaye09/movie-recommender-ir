<plot>A young woman reporter passes through Skidmore, Missouri on her way back to Washington, DC. where her life is interrupted along the way by an act of violence. Based on a true story, the film examines the life of sex predator Ken McElroy - the self-proclaimed "King of Nodaway County." Known for his violence and penchant for young girls, McElroy constantly challenged the little town of Skidmore. "I am everything and you are nothing. I can make you do anything I want!" On a hot summer day, in the mistaken belief that he had raped and killed a young girl, McElroy was shot dead on the main street of Skidmore, Missouri. 55 people watched, no indictments followed, no trial was ever held, no one came forward to reveal his killers. To this day the killing at Skidmore remains an unsolved murder. This award winning film examines the last six days in the life of Ken Rex McElroy - the most hated man in Missouri.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659190</url></doc>
