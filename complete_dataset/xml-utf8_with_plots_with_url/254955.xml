<plot>'I'm Not Dead Yet' is a story of intrigue in an eccentric English family, brought to light by a 'King Lear'-like struggle over the inheritance of their Gothic stately home. Eighty-two year old Ruth promises her beloved Dunwood Hall to one of her twin daughters, with whom she has lived for the past thirty-five years. As seemingly comedic tensions begin to mount over the handover, Ruth flees to France, into the arms of her other, estranged twin daughter. Ruth's granddaughter Elizabeth documents the struggle over the family home, and the emerging, dark secrets that lie within its walls. What history haunts the twins and divides the family? Ruth's turbulent journey sees the past erupt into the present, and the unraveling of a family consumed by forty years of silence and denial. Corroded home movie footage shot over half a century creates a beautiful, haunting texture, as we hear each of these three womens different memories of what happened juxtaposed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254955</url></doc>
