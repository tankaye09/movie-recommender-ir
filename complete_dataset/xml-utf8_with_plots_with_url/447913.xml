<plot>An affable loser tries to win the girl of his dreams and the biggest tractor pull of the season. All that stands in his way is the girl's father, the Dale Earnhardt of tractor pulling, who'll stop at nothing to protect his daughter and his reputation as champion. With the help of a washed up rider who long ago boozed away his talent and his tractor pulling career, our hero sets out to beat all the odds in this comic satire of racing movies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?447913</url></doc>
