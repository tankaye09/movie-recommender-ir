<plot>Billy Hatchett, a DEA "specialist", leads a group of agents through a desolate Mexican desert to bust members of a major drug cartel. The bust goes as planned, but afterwards, on the journey back to the border, Hatchett encounters danger from an unsuspected source; his own men! Two of them, Kraven and Jordan, in a planned betrayal, leave Hatchett for dead and disappear with a small fortune in "evidence." Hatchett is not so easy to kill and survives. Eighteen months later, recovered and out of the DEA, Hatchett has entered a new business. One suited to his particular brand of skills - bounty hunting. He uses the money not only to support himself, but his sister as well. The sister has been very ill and lost her job. The illness is serious, and without Hatchett, she'd likely be in the street. During a court appearance for one of his captures, Hatchett gets a request from Judge Trilla Vanetti. Normally opposed to Hatchett's aggressive way of capturing people, Trilla finds herself forced into an uncomfortable partnership with him. She needs Hatchett's help in tracking down her teenaged niece, Jamie, who has gotten herself mixed up with some dangerous people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070884</url></doc>
