<plot>Lazer Tag Academy is the story of Jamie Jaren, a thirteen year old Lazer Tag champion from 3010 who journeys back in time to stop the evil Draxon Drear. She joins with her ancestors, Tom, Beth and Nicky Jaren who also share her special powers. For most people, Starlites, the Lazer Tag "guns" are harmless toys. But for others, like the Jarens, they become weapons that allow them, along with the Star Sensor, allow them to travel in time, move object, ect. Lazer Tag Academy is a cartoon based on the Lazer Tag toy and was produced by Ruby Spears Animation. It aired on NBC from Sept. 13, 1986- Aug. 22, 1987 and was canceled only due to the bankruptcy of Worlds of Wonder, the makers of Lazer Tag. In the mid 90's the rights to Lazer Tag Academy were purchased by Saban Entertainment (owned by Haim Saban who did the music for the show) and it re-aired under the title Laser Patrol on the Sci-Fi Channel. In July 2001, Saban's library of more than 6,500 episodes of children's programming was purchased by Disney as part of the Fox Family Channel buy-out (FFC was owned by Saban). So does Disney now own Lazer Tag Academy? They might!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321875</url></doc>
