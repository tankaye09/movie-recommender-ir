<plot>We all deal with death in different ways. ANTHOLOGY is 5 separate main characters' unrelated life experiences, each dealing with different emotional states, each presented as vignettes all dealing with the human condition. This film illustrates five examples of how we all can be extremely affected by death in it's many forms, it is the unifying theme of these stories. CLOSURE is the story of a young woman's search for answers surrounding her brother's death. The only person who can give her the truth is the man serving prison for the crime. VENGEANCE is the story of the great lengths someone will go for revenge. A distraught man takes a therapeutic drive across the country while recalling pieces of his tragic past. A couple's relationship and lives are at stake in JEALOUSY. A man discovers his fianc√© is cheating on him with one of their childhood friends. Tragedy unfolds as the truth begins to come out, destroying lives. Is something going on beneath the surface? Two friends are bonded by a pact of death in BETRAYAL. One friend keeps his end of a deadly bargain when the other exposes their dark secret. In ACCEPTANCE, constantly stuck in a cross between dreams and reality, a man struggles to sleep on the night before his wife's funeral. This is ANTHOLOGY. Five stories. Five lives. It will all make sense in the end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042399</url></doc>
