<plot>Ethan Mescher is an introverted illustrator who spends his days noticing &amp; drawing the details of strangers into his comic book journal, of which he is the star. While awaiting word from his agent about the publication of his work, Ethan begins to grow closer to Nora, a beautiful and free-spirited young woman who works at the local plant nursery. Faced with the threat of intimacy and the honest truth about his own life's work, Ethan experiences an awakening, as his need to capture the beauty that he sees begins to overwhelm and illuminate him. Ethan Mescher will soon realize that there are some moments we cannot capture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262987</url></doc>
