<plot>As much as has been said of panoramic views, no picture ever taken of one can compare favorably with this entirely new subject. The roadbed of the New York Central R. R., is clearly shown, winding its way around tall mountains, across bridges and through the famous Haverstraw Tunnel, about one mile in length, and emerging therefrom, rises to an eminence and from this height can be seen in the distance far below in the beautiful valley a sheet of water and surrounding farms so true to nature as to remind one of country life so much written about in song and story. The curves in the road shoot past like a cannon ball, fired from a big Krupp gun, and you stand amazed at the ingenuity of the master mind who invented the apparatus for reproducing nature so true and lifelike. A film like this one is a whole show in itself, and anyone exhibiting it must be prepared to repeat it again and again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422017</url></doc>
