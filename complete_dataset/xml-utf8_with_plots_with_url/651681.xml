<plot>A number of bad boys knock at the door of a house and scamper off and when the woman of the house answers the call, no one is there. They repeat this several times when the woman induces her husband to go after them even though he is confined to the house with a bad case of toothache. He hunts high and low for them but they are nowhere to be found and he returns to the house. As he closes the door, the Milkman happens along and knocks at the door as usual. The lord of the manor makes a dash for the door and throwing it open wide, without looking at the man, assaults him and they both fall spilling the milk over the pavement after which they arise and make due apology.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651681</url></doc>
