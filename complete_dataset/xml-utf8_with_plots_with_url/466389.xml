<plot>Here we see one of the methods employed in the search for gold, where water is scarce. We see the workmen using the water over and over again in the rocker until it becomes too thick with earth for further use. The scene is one of action, as the valuable character of the ground enables many to work profitably in close quarters. An interesting and instructive subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?466389</url></doc>
