<plot>David just graduated from high school, and he needs to make enough money for his college tuition if he is ever going to get out of Brooklyn. All the good summer jobs are taken, but with help of his friend Jerry, David talks his way into waiting tables at an upstate New York hotel. It ain't much money, but it's his only choice.
