<plot>No such film bearing this title, and starring Roy Stewart, was either produced or distributed by Universal at this time. Production may have been suspended before completion, or else it may have been released under another title. There is also the possibility that this is the re-release title of another film, identity unknown. It has no relation to A Jungle Gentleman, a two-reel comedy distributed by Universal in 1919.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281715</url></doc>
