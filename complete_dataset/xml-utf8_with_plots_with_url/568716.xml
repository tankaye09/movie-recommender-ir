<plot>The brothers who began the worldwide bungee craze, back in 1987, reunite at a bridge where they used to run guerilla bungee trips. At the bridge they jump off, connected only to climbing rope, not bungee cords! Older brother, John Kockelman - a stunt engineering major at UCD - wants to test the dynamics of climbing rope for an even bigger stunt. John wants to shatter the world high fall record, currently 232 feet, by doing a jump from 10,000 feet, without a parachute. Younger brother Peter, also an engineer, will build a giant trampoline (designed by John), to be strung across the rim of a football stadium for John to land in at terminal velocity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568716</url></doc>
