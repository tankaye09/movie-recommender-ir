<plot>Between the Caribbean Sea and the Mayan mountains lies Toledo, known as The Forgotten District of Belize, Central America. For the last 20 years, the Maya have been promoting their own eco-tourism programme in order to protect their rain forest and traditions. Despite constant opposition from the government and the tourist industry, Margarita, Reyes, Chet and their friends remain strong and optimistic. This film is a tribute to their tireless efforts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558825</url></doc>
