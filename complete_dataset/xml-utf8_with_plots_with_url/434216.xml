<plot>A small stage has a backdrop of a city street, sidewalks, a park, and buildings. From stage right, a boy leads a blind man onto the stage, helps him kneel with his hat and cane in front of him. The boy hands a sign, "pity the blind" around the man's neck and leaves. A fellow in a bowler hat passes by, dropping a coin in the blind man's hat. Then two well-dressed women enter, talking. They stop; one fishes a coin out of her purse for the blind man; the other asks her friend to keep a look out for passersby, as she lifts her skirt to adjust her garter and hose. Someone watches with delight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434216</url></doc>
