<plot>Diyva and Karan Saxena are in love and plan to marry, after Karan goes to London for some business opportunity. Karan has a younger step-brother, Vivek Saxena who he looks after him as though he were his own brother. Divya and Vivek hang out with quite a few young people of their own age, Atul, Vijay, Prem,Ashok, Nita, Rashmi, Niki, and Priti, just to name a few. Two male members try to sexually molest Divya, and get a sound thrashing from Karan. After apologizing, these two members decide to avenge their beating and humiliation. After entrapping Divya, they sexually molest her to such an extent that Divya attempts to kill herself. Unknown to Divya, she was the lover of Kapil a snake with magical powers, in a previous life. Their love life was shattered by an angry sage who cursed them with separation until the 21st century. Divya, who was called Vasundhara in her previous life, dies after this curse, and is reborn as Divya. Now seeing Divya dying, Kapil swears to avenge her death by killing them one by one. Divya does die, but her spirit has survived and joins Kapil to avenge her humiliation and death, not against the two members, but against all the male members. Soon death visits the friends one by one, and no one can stop the killing. Until one fine day Karan returns from London only to find that Divya is no more alive and that his brother is wanted by Divya and Kapil in connection with Divya's murder but Karan assure to everyone that anyone who touches his brother will not remain alive. And that he will die but keep up his promise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271737</url></doc>
