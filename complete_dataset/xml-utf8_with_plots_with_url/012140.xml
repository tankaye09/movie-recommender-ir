<plot>This rather remarkable picture was taken for the United States Fisheries Commission and shows the landing of an enormous shad sein with a catch of fish running into the thousands. The net is handled by negro roustabouts and makes an exceedingly pretty sight as the mass of fish rolls in, with silvery sides glistening in the sun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012140</url></doc>
