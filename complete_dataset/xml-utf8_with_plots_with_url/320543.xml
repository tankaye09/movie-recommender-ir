<plot>Tracing the arc of one man's "life-changing panic" in the months before his impending wedding, aspiring (and by most accounts not very promising) actor Richie sets out on a summer-long odyssey to compete as a demolition derby driver throughout the Northeast. Risking what little he has - namely his engagement and his neck - he struggles to fulfill a lifelong dream in the face of no money, no skills, and little hope. This largely improvised film is an inspired mix of fictional scenes and interactions with the real-life denizens of demolition derbies, all characters in their own right, who think the camera crew is making a straight documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320543</url></doc>
