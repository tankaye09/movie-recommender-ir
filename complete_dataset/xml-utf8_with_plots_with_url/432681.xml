<plot>The first view is a train returning to the Manitou station from the summit of Pike's Peak. It shows clearly the construction of the engine, cars, tracks, etc., and also the disembarkment of the passengers. The next section of the picture is the actual ascent over the cog tracks, to the summit of the most noted mountain in the United States--Pike's Peak, which is 14,147 feet high. The picture is an approaching view from the front end of the cars, as the engine pushes the train up the mountain instead of pulling it. The grade at places rises twenty-five per cent, or one foot in every four. At first a great amount of foliage is seen. This becomes less as the train ascends. When 11,000 feet elevation is reached, all vegetation disappears. Climbing through untimbered slopes is, without doubt, a new experience for most people. The last part of the film shows the summit of Pike's Peak and its surroundings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432681</url></doc>
