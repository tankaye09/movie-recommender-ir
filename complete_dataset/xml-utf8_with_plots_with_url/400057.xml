<plot>An extreme consequence of adults indifference about adolescents; the age of adolescence seen by the directors as one of the most critical and fragile period of the life. Two fourteen-agers meet two young women (30 years old) and try to be men: our two players challenging the life, decide to invite to go out two women, the double older then them. They try to be men but when the situation turns in "adult" direction (in what they wanted!) they don't know what to do, and react as children, as they are. One of them falls asleep and the other starts to cry desperately.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400057</url></doc>
