<plot>A drifter heads to Baja with his teen daughter for a lucrative construction job. Only problem is that when he gets there, the job doesn't exist. This leads him into a job smuggling Mexicans across the border and into the inevitable trouble. This leads father and daughter into a new view of one another - the daughter seeing her father's fallibility and the father seeing his daughter's own growth as a young woman. Lina Gallegos also appears as an old friend of the father, who becomes a mother figure to the girl.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117513</url></doc>
