<plot>As the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the past two decades under arrest in the Southeast Asian country of Burma. She is truly that rare hero of a legend - a symbol of hope - championing the rights of individuals in the face of human rights violations and dictatorial oppression. Freedom From Fear is a groundbreaking feature documentary that chronicles Suu Kyi's story and the struggle for human rights, democracy, and freedom in Burma. The film takes viewers on a journey behind the scenes and into the lives of activists around the world working to promote change in Burma. Over two decades ago, Aung San Suu Kyi and a group of student activists initiated a massive popular uprising where over 10,000 civilians were brutally gun down by the military regime. Since that point a global movement has been building to inspire change. Calling on the lessons learned from previous non-violent movements, Freedom from Fear pays tribute to the epic courage and monumental power of spirit in Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters around the world who have sacrificed their own lives, families, and freedoms in pursuit of democracy and human rights.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203447</url></doc>
