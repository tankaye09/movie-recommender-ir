<plot>On July 4th, 1976, five clergymen of the Pallotti Communicti were brutally murdered at Saint PAtrick's Church in the neighborhood of Belgrano, Buenos Airs. Rolando Savino, who was a young organist there at the time, was the one who found the dead bodies on that cold morning. Today, 30 years later, Rolando is still playing the organ in the same place trying to remember those men that taught him great teaching that would make him become the man he is today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118439</url></doc>
