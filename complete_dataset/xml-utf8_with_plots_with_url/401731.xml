<plot>A documentary about the life and music of singer-songwriter Jacques Brel, with footage of several live performances. After growing up in Belgium and working in his father's factory, Brel marries and has children, but he soon grows discontent with his life and leaves everything behind, moving to Paris to become a singer-songwriter. His career takes off and he becomes one of France's most revered performers. After tremendous success, he suddenly retires from music, becoming an actor and film director instead. He trains as a pilot and learns how to sail, traveling extensively around the world, until he finally settles on an island in the Pacific Ocean. He dies young of cancer. The film tells his story through narration and interviews with his daughter, friends, and musical associates. Clips of his musical performances include some of his best known songs: "Ne me quitte pas," "Valse Ã€ mille temps," "Amsterdam," "Le plat pays" and "Quand on n'a que l'amour," among others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401731</url></doc>
