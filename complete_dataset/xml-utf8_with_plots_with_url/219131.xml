<plot>Goldfish is a movie about five young Asian twenty-somethings, at that crucial point of growing up. They're searching for love, friendship, and direction that resonate with anyone who's ever felt lost. Most of their parents are wealthy corporate business people in Taiwan who have sent them to America for a better education and standard of living. Like goldfish that swim aimlessly in a predator-free tank, these young Asian kids are trapped in this perfect world and realize that the only meaning of life is to stay alive. No matter how hard they fall, they know they'll still be better off than the life of an average person. Resenting their parents' demand to be thankful for their privileged lives, they feel guilty for not appreciating what they already have. Goldfish explores their deepest desire and inner fears. These young adults must choose between stability or excitement; working for pennies or their passion. Will they be unable to escape their family's attempt to pull them into the family business? Will they express their individuality or fall in the Gap? This is a hip film that takes a humorous approach showing a group of people's internal conflicts. What lives beneath the surface of this pretty, peaceful tank? The beauty of their lives is only skin deepÂ¡K</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219131</url></doc>
