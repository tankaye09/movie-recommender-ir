<plot>An aging ballerina looks for a place to belong to after leaving a ballet company. How will she fit into the world? Her love of dance remains within her, but what does she do about her dreams of the stage? Ballet is the only place she thinks she'll fit in. She's most happy when she's dancing. Thirty-three years old may sound old for a ballet dancer, but it's not that old. Or is it? Pirouette explores this journey of a lost ballerina trying to find her identity. The film's original score, original dance scenes and dramatic imagery from the San Francisco Bay Area combine to bring this touching mood piece to life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433910</url></doc>
