<plot>'DEUCE' is a slice-of-life documentary chronicling the unique existence of Lawrence 'Deuce' Skurcenski, an eccentric 66 year-old sports statistician in Western Pennsylvania. Skurcenski is a Damon Runyon-type character that has achieved legendary status locally based on his colorful personality and constant presence at sporting events in the Pittsburgh area. Deuce has been omnipresent at sporting venues, logging stats at over 12,000 basketball &amp; football games since 1954. He's instantly recognized everywhere, though some people don't know exactly who he is or precisely what he does.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143109</url></doc>
