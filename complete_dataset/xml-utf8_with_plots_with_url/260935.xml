<plot>This is the story of a few hundred people who took arrangements to have their bodies frozen after death. The process is scientifically called "cryonic suspension": when someone dies his corpse is immersed in a container full of liquid nitrogen at the temperature of 196 degrees below zero. Their dead bodies will be preserved this way, until the magic science of the future is able to bring them back to life. The last crazy idea of some eccentric multimillionaire? Not really, since the majority of the people we are talking about are teachers, computer programmers, plain workers and old-age pensioners. Instead, looks like the latest answer to the eternal question of life and death, from a "scientific" point of view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260935</url></doc>
