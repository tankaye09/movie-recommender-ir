<plot>'Imagine' follows the creation of 'LOVE', a spectacular collaboration bringing together the magic of The Beatles' music with the imagination of Cirque Du Soleil. The documentary had exclusive access to Sir George Martin, along with his son/co-producer Giles Martin, as they demonstrated the process by which the soundtrack was created. The entire, long-protected Beatles' back catalog was made available and, by re-mixing and re-mastering the Beatles' recorded performances, completely new music was produced.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260690</url></doc>
