<plot>Bean with Bacon Soup, a slice of the life of cartoon trash buddies. An unlikely group of items of discard whose world is confined to the backyard of a small dilapidated travel trailer. A flower is born in a small puddle of oily water in the center of a worn P205-75R-14 bias ply tire, a hypodermic needle calls an old microwave home and 2 discarded soda container tops are awakened from their dreams of aspiration and friendship. A pickle who is second best to a warming light bulb at the Kings Table all you can eat lunch buffet is just along for the ride. During a short commercial break the friendship of two of Americas favorite lunch buddies blossoms. Finally this pointless journey ends as the trash buddies arrive at the Salisbury steak show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061960</url></doc>
