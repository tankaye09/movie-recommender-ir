<plot>The Write Environment: A compelling new series that takes us backstage into the heretofore unseen world of the writer's room for an intimate one-on-one interview with some of today's most prolific writers. As entertaining as it informative, this series will be of value to fledgling writers and seasoned pros alike; as some of the most successful writers reminisce about their careers and discuss their craft. In these candid interviews each of these award winning comic book writers gives us an inside look at their writing environments and discusses their work habits, their creative process and past and present projects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602502</url></doc>
