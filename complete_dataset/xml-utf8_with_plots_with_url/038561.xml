<plot>A woman-hating writer rescues a young woman lying injured on the road. When she regains consciousness, she insists that she is his wife. His uncle and the family doctor persuade him to humor her until they find a solution to the problem. In the process, he falls in love with her and calls her anamika (girl without a name). But as unexpectedly as she had come into his life, just as unexpectedly, she vanishes one night. He is despondent. Then one night at a party, he meets her again, but she refuses to recognize him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038561</url></doc>
