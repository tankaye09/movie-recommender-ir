<plot>It may be a car, a computer, or a household appliance... ordinary objects that could make your coffee or change your life. But behind every one of them is an extraordinary amount of creativity, hard work, dedication, and risk. This is the story of one such object... the ultimate backyard barbecue. From conception to completion, we'll build an all-new kind of barbecue from the ground up. Be a part of the dreams, brainstorming, designs, testing, models, failures, successes, inspiration, intuition, prototypes, and finally... the perfect product. You'll discover the tension between art, commerce, time, function, and passion. They are the keys to success. They are the driving force behind brilliant visions. They are the heart and soul of The Launch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162127</url></doc>
