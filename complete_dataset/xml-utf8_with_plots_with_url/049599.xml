<plot>Marvin is from Evanston. He has a date in Laramie with Aubrey, a woman he met on the internet. For his date, he embarks on a 300 mile journey across the state of Wyoming, only to chicken out. Marvin's irrational fears lead him to Cheyenne, where he seeks his sister's immediate help. Instead, he receives a dangerous amount of sibling scolding. With all odds against him, he embarks back to Laramie to win Aubrey over. Just as he approaches his destination, an encounter with an old high school buddy, throws Marvin's plans out of control and causes him to cave in. Then, as he waits for a date that's nowhere in sight, it is up to Marvin to march on, or call it quits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049599</url></doc>
