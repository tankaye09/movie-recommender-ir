<plot>A candid, comprehensive interview with Sir Laurence Olivier - the only such profile the actor/director ever allowed - offers an intimate visit with the legendary star of stage and screen. Running nearly two hours and forty minutes, this landmark biography follows Olivier's entire life and career from childhood on, capturing his genius for future generations. Clips shown from his films include "Wuthering Heights," "Rebecca," "Pride and Prejudice," "Henry V," "Hamlet," "Richard III," "The Entertainer," "Othello," "Sleuth," and "Marathon Man." Key partnerships, on and offstage are recalled by Olivier and by Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Sir John Gielguld, Sir Ralph Richardson, his wife Joan Plowright and other friends and colleagues. Multi-award winner including the British Academy Award, The New York International Film and TV Festival Gold Medal Award, and the Primetime TV Emmy Award for Best Documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321471</url></doc>
