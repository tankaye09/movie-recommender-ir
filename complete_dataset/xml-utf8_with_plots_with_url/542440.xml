<plot>WEASEL RABBIT, tries to woo pretty HUNNYBUNNY and is interrupted by the bully, BRUTUS and his goofy sidekick, LUG. Caught in a lie that he is an old friend of the narcissistic, trash-eating BEAR, Weasel hops out to the bear and pretends to hold a conversation with the giant bear. Suddenly the bear does what bears do in the forest and the reabbit joins in. Afterwards the bear asks the rabbit if poop sticks to his fur, Weasel says: "No," so the bear uses Weasel as toilet paper.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542440</url></doc>
