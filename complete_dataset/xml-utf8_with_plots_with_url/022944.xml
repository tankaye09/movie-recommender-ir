<plot>For centuries belief in miracles has been relegated to lunatics and religious fanatics. But not so very long ago, that all began to change. In 1991, LIFE Magazine ran a cover story about miracles and became one of the first mainstream news source to acknowledge the thousands of mysterious, 'miraculous' phenomena that had been happening around the world. "Acts of God" is a compelling and inspirational examination of the scientific evidence behind these miracles, and presents all the facts needed for viewers to draw their own conclusions. It examines the worldwide belief in miraculous events and how they affect everyday people, and includes the testimony of a respected medical doctor who has documented proof of the healing power of prayer. An unprecedented television event for the entire family, this informative and objective special hosted by world-renowned journalist Bryant Gumbel is sure to leave even the most skeptical non-believers scratching their heads and asking -- are miracles possible?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022944</url></doc>
