<plot>Raja (Jeetendra) lives with his widowed sister Divya (Meena Kumari) in a small village. He is constantly being made a target by the oppressive local Zamindar and his two children, Sagar and Chanchal. The land owner's children decide to take revenge on Raja by getting Sagar married to Raja's sweetheart Neela. The Zamindar also molests Raja's sister, who kills herself. With his Neela married and his sister dead, a devastated Raja heads to the city. Once over there he attempts to put his life together, and try to forget the past. It is then he meets with another victim of the Zamindar, Bajrangi (Mehmood) and together they conceive a plan that will avenge them against their oppressors. The question is, will they succeed or will there be more victims.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274313</url></doc>
