<plot>A lively portrait of the Kuna Indians of Panama as they unite to protect their homeland, Kuna Yala, and the tradition it inspires. Told entirely in the words of the Kunas, the film contrasts a variety of characters who together tell a story of a culture in flux. At a time when our society is struggling with its relationship to nature, The Spirit of Kuna Yala reminds us that the timeless wisdom of indigenous peoples has something vital to offer the Western world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592570</url></doc>
