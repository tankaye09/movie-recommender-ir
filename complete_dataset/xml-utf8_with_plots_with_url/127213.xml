<plot>Joseph A. Doakes goes into a magic shop and asks to see tricks that might interest him as an amateur magician. After a store employee demonstrates several of them, Doakes purchases a number of them starts demonstrating them for his son, who is totally bored. For some unknown reason, the tricks worked better in the store than they do at home, even though instructions are included. In the final trick, Doakes makes himself disappear. Where he ends up after the trick is over must remain a mystery until you see this short film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127213</url></doc>
