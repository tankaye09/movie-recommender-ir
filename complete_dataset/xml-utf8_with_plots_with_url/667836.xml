<plot>Emperor Kangxi has many problems,to relieve some of his stress the running of his court and governing of the country falls to his four best officials (who are more like bumbling fools). Unknown to the emperor these four in particular are actually to busy spouting nonsense and incorrect verses as well as quarreling with each other to care about the court or country, how could the Emperor leave things to them? Much hilarity follows as events unfold.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667836</url></doc>
