<plot>Amar lives in a small village with his widowed mom. When his mom gets ill, he brings her to a hospital in Bombay, and this is where he meets with Dr. Pooja and both fall in love with each other. When the hospital informs Amar that his mom needs a surgical procedure which costs over one Lakh Rupees, Amar takes to crime with the help of Kasturi and Pyaremohan, and in this way he gets his mom treated. When the time comes for Amar to marry Pooja, both run into a major obstacle - none other than the modern Robin Hoodsque brother of Pooja, Ajay, who had to spend time in jail after being apprehended by Amar. Ajay will never permit Amar and Pooja to get married - especially after he finds out that Amar is also involved in crime. Nevertheless, Amar and Pooja elope, get married, and spend their honey-moon out of Bombay. This is where Pooja will get sexually assaulted and killed - and the prime suspect for the police is Amar - but first Ajay needs to settle an old score with Amar before killing him. The question remains was it Amar who killed Pooja, and will Ajay get to carry out his gruesome task?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153050</url></doc>
