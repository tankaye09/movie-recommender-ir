<plot>Jacob is an ordinary man living an ordinary life with his beautiful wife, until the day he wakes up in an eerie hotel room to find himself being brutally tortured by a mysterious woman. He succumbs to the unbearable pain and loses consciousness; only to awake safely back in his own home the next morning to discover that he has been missing for days. At first, Jacob believes his experience was just a vivid nightmare, until it happens again, and then again. As each episode becomes more realistic, he loses his grasp on what is real and what seems to be a sick game. Who are his friends? Who are his enemies? What is the truth? In the end the truth will be a lie, and the evil consuming him will stem not from his actions, but from his secret.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015764</url></doc>
