<plot>Larry Fonseca is just another child who is a product of American society. Born in the United States, he is the son of immigrant parents and is about ten years old. When he gets out of school, he goes straight home and has one objective: to sit for long hours before the computer, turn on the television set and watch action movies, or bury himself in bloody combat in front of a video game monitor. Larry is only ten years old, and he can tell the difference between a 9mm pistol and a Colt 45, and he knows how to use a fragmentation grenade or a Molotov cocktail. Watch out! Larry knows how to use these weapons, and there's no one checking on him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319361</url></doc>
