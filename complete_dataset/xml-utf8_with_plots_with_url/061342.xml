<plot>While escorting the fair Princess Angelica across the galaxy and back to her home, the Princess grows bored. To appease her, the biggest Battletoad, Pimple, takes her off the 'Toads' ship for a joyride in a small space cruiser. Unfortunately, this allows their deadly nemesis, the Dark Queen, to kidnap Princess Angelica, and in doing so she kidnaps Pimple too. The other two 'Toads, Rash and Zitz, are furious and vow to get their friend and the Princess back no matter how many obstacles they must face.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061342</url></doc>
