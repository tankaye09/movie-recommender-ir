<plot>Years ago, two young friends went down different paths in their lives. One became a by-the-books police officer (Nick Vaccaro); the other became a criminal (Kyle Pucciarello). Now, on the day of Kyle's release, their two paths will cross once again. Nick suspects that Kyle is guilty of much more than the burglary for which he was imprisoned. Meanwhile, Kyle is trying to repair broken bridges at home and show his wife (Melissa Formica) that he isn't the same person he used to be. And on this fateful day, these two lives will collide. Watch as a young man comes face to face with choosing between the duty he is sworn to uphold and the conscience crying out within him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425946</url></doc>
