<plot>The story takes place three years into the future. Events represented take place in 1914, when supposedly there is a war between the united European states and the United States of America. The hero is commissioned to fly over the enemy's fleet in a war aeroplane and destroy them. This he does by dropping bombs. He is then told to spy upon their land forces, but his aeroplane is brought to earth by a portable gun of the enemy that shoots directly into midair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576504</url></doc>
