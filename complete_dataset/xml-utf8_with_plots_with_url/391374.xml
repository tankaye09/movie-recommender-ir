<plot>On Christmas Eve, a couple squabbles over an angry letter sent to Santa, tired of his annual trespassing. Santa is fed up and sends a foreboding response. The couple preps their apartment for an attack, but Santa breaks through with a surprise entrance. The couple battles Santa using any means at their disposal. In the chaos, the wife finds a secret heartfelt present from her husband. She stops the fighting, pleading for the true meaning of Christmas. But Santa's had it, and continues his rampage against the couple, until he is taken down by his own weakness for cookies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391374</url></doc>
