<plot>An homage to Norman McLaren, this is a paint-on-film work that combines permanent marker animation with a live action dancer in silhouette. Made in 1975 as an undergraduate student project. The theme is 'external play becoming internal consciousness'. A half day of improvised dance movement and one very long night of frame by frame drawing. Film stock used was high-contrast 16mm titling film, which produced a silhouetted image of the dance which was completely opaque to the marker colors. Sanford Sharpies were used for the paint-on-film drawing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198061</url></doc>
