<plot>Tony Carat is a carefree pizza delivery guy until he meets Audrey Spelling, a smart, driven casting director. Tony and Audrey have a short courtship and in impulsive fashion, marry. Audrey is disappointed with Tony's lack of ambition; in a desire to become more accomplished, Tony becomes an entrepreneur. Soon the newlyweds are wealthy; Audrey feels responsible for her husband's success. Audrey indulges in her shopping habit quite recklessly, starts her own production company and plans for a baby. Tony desires to give his wife whatever she wants, which leads to him embezzling from his partner. When he is caught and fired, he decides to come up with creative ways to get more money. A local crime lord notices him and invites him to join a mysterious brotherhood. Tony's moves get wilder and more desperate to hold on to everything while covering his lies. When he makes a mistake and gets Audrey involved, he must decide what he is willing to give up to get her back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602408</url></doc>
