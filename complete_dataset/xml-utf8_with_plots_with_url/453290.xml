<plot>A popular religious affairs documentary series. The name Radharc means view or vision, and the programme logo (the Radharc man) comes from one of the panels representing the 12 Apostles on the High Cross of Moone (Ireland). The Radharc Team produced over 400 Religious Films in every corner of the globe between 1961 and 1996. Radharc documentaries have won international awards and an international reputation. Radharc Films ceased production in 1996 following the death of founder-director Fr. Joseph Dunn. The substantial Archive of over 400 films is currently deposited with the Irish Film Archive, with copyright of the programme material jointly held between the Radharc Trust and RTÃ‰. The Archive is managed by Esras Films on behalf of the Radharc Trust.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453290</url></doc>
