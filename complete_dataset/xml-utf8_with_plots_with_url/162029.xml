<plot>Eddie wants to break up with Elaine, but fears he'll wimp out in the middle of the conversation, so he rehearses in a caf√© with his long-time friend Beth. That day, and twice more, each a week apart, Beth coaches him. Two waitresses overhear the rehearsals and think it's the real thing. As they try to sort out what's going on, Beth and Eddie's motives get cloudy. What's the game, and when things clear up, can the waitresses keep from giving their own tips to Eddie and Beth?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162029</url></doc>
