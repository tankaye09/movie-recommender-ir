<plot>A critically acclaimed documentary about the criminal phenomenon known as 'raskolism' and its underlying human rights issues in Papua New Guinea. The film looks at the violent behaviour of Raskol gangs and their growing anger against a small government elite which is jeopardising the sustainable human development of a whole nation. The film follows the lives of the Nightfox and Kaupeke gangs of the Western Highlands as they try to make sense of their traditional past, their criminal actions and their future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?455763</url></doc>
