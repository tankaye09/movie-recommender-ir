<plot>When Daggi is 15 years old, he gets the opportunity to change his life. A fresh start, another chance. But is it possible to start over? Daggi puts the little he owns in a bag and carries his past in a key, around the neck&amp;. He tries to adjust his new life in a small village - as a foster child in a family who's filled with love and care, and Gustav, who's always wished for a big brother. Together they play Yatzy - Gustav's favorite game. Cause in Yatzy everyone has a chance. The village is tiny and boring. Daggi is restless and paranoid - trying to keep a distance to everything. Then he meets Gloria. Gloria who drives a scooter and sees Daggi as an opportunity to get away. Together they discover the beauty of love, - they escape to Sweden and life seems for the first time easy and good. Until his past hunts him down, lead by Dennis, and drags him back to a life he neither can be a part of - nor get away from.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664310</url></doc>
