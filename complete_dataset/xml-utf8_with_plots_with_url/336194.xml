<plot>Biographical "Behind The Scenes" interview and documentary illustrations of the foundational training and influences of Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, ASC. Using the back drop of the recently restored "Summer Children" (B&amp;W 1965) an early work of Vilmos Zsigmond, ASC, the producer of "Summer Children" Jack Robinette interviews Vilmos about many subjects ranging from Hungarian influences, perspectives on Black and White, American New Wave, cameras, optics, and behind the scenes stories with his colleagues and friends. Special attention is placed on restoration, multi platform film making, and the role of the cinematographer today with new technologies and work-flows. Vilmos' approach to life long learning and teaching is also studied and illustrated through interviews with new film makers who were influenced or trained by him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336194</url></doc>
