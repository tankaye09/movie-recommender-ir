<plot>Joe and Natasha both go to the local coffee shop in hopes that they will be more successful finding love than they have been on the Internet. Thoughts are buzzing from all direction, from every coffee shop patron, and then Joe spots Natasha in the corner reading a book. He wishes she'd look up so he can see her eyes, and his wish comes true... But that's not all. The two lonely souls are magically connected and they can read each other's minds. In a moment each of them knows that the other is their dream come true, but as soon as the eye contact is broken, so is the magical connection, and they'll have to be brave enough to go on faith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110223</url></doc>
