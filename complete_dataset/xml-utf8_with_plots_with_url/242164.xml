<plot>Mohan is a medical student who lives in the United States. One day, he receives a strange phone call from his grandfather asking him to come back to his native village in India. Once he arrives, he finds out that his brother and sister-in-aw have mysteriously disappeared. Moreover, his little cousin Tanaji survived, but is behaving very strangely: he never speaks a word, gets up in the middle of the night, sometimes suddenly turns cold, and mistreats his toys. Mohan tries to solve the mystery, but fails to find a rational explanation for all the creepy things that happen. Everything points in the direction of the caretaker's wife, Parvati, who performs rituals of black magic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?242164</url></doc>
