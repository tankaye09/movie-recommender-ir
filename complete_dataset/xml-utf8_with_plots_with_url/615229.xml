<plot>Trading with the Enemy follows an American who's looking to make a fast buck in Cuba's illegal cigar trade. Fat cats back home clamor for the forbidden tobacco, and Terry knows just how to get it. From Austin, Texas to Havana, Cuba, our guide Terry shows us the ropes of this black market bonanza. Hoping to make a few dollars themselves, locals help Terry navigate the murky waters of illegal, back street fabricas. But cigars aren't all that he's after, and many young women of Havana have a lucrative business of their own making friends with gringos like Terry. Interweaving the cigar and sex trade with a healthy dose of Havana's sights and sounds, Trading with the Enemy opens a window on the sorry state of exploitation and survival in the waning years of Castro's Cuba.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615229</url></doc>
