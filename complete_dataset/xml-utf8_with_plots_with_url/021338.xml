<plot>It was impossible to get through the system and impossible to build. Neil &amp; Sue Ablitt won the lottery to get a water hookup on their 20x20 lot in the middle of a commercial zone off Haley Street in downtown Santa Barbara. Getting approval to build a residence on the property involved a battle with neighbors, the planning commission, and an appeal with the City Council. Once the permits were in place the challenges didn't end because building such a structure required the expertise of a talented architect and contractor. The Ablitts supported each other through the process and now have a house that's a work of art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021338</url></doc>
