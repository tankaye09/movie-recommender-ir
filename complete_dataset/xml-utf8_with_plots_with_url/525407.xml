<plot>This and the pictures immediately following [AT THE FOUNTAIN, REX'S BATH, AROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH, WATER NYMPHS, A LAWN PARTY, and WASH DAY] constitute an unusually fine group of children's scenes. The action in each is natural and unaffected, and the photographic value very high. This film, called "Sweethearts," shows two youngsters, a boy and a girl, about 3 years of age, sitting on a little lawn bench, making love. The boy kisses the girl in true grown-up fashion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525407</url></doc>
