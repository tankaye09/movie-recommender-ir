<plot>"In this picture you can see the Cuban soldiers as they are firing at the Spanish soldiers with a dynamite cannon. You see how quickly they take the great cannon apart and carry it away on their soldiers; then coming back again, they put the cannon together, fire another charge, then disappear. This picture was taken in a country town near Havana, amid the peaceful country scenery, near where the battle was raging fiercely. This was the first live motion picture of the war that was brought from Cuba. No one can imagine how realistic this subject is! See it and you would not be without it at any price. As the revolution in Spain is the topic of the day, everybody, young and old, is interested. This picture is exciting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081898</url></doc>
