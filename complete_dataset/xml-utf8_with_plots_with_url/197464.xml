<plot>Fletcher Street sheds light on a community in downtown Philadelphia that has amazingly been home to a once thriving group of urban horsemen. Today, as the neighborhood around them continues to erode, a small, core group of men are trying to save their way of life, their kids and their horses. Through the everyday tenants of basic horsemanship and care, the men teach lessons in love, discipline and reward and help give kids a desperately needed sense of accomplishment, self-worth and belonging.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197464</url></doc>
