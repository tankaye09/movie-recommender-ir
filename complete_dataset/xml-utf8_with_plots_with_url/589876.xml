<plot>MEL, a 20-year-old disenchanted kid, drifts through life with a simple question stuck in his mind: a spider and I on the ceiling, what's the difference? He decides it's time to take a journey of self-discovery by visiting his sanctuaries: Bathrooms. His journey immediately becomes an unpleasant one by unwelcome visits of individuals who have fallen prey to one of The Seven Deadly Sins. With each excursion, Mel and the sinners learn something about each other, affecting the sins they had of the individual. From a lazy police officer who used to a surgeon and a sex addict veterinarian, to a bi-polar Yakuza team, Mel's pursuit of self-discovery is filled with road-blocks. With final ironic twists on each story, Mel eventually is back where he began...
