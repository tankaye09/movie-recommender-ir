<plot>Raising Your Dog with The Monks of New Skete is a holistic training film that features the internationally renowned training methods of the Monks of New Skete. The Monks are the best-selling authors of How to be Your Dog's Best Friend and The Art of Raising a Puppy. This 3 hour series, filmed entirely on location at the monastery, covers all of the essential lessons of the New Skete approach and provides owners with the tools and confidence to forge a healthy relationship through a program based on knowledge, insight, and mutual respect. The DVDs detail everything you need to know about raising your puppy, behavior conditioning, becoming the alpha-leader, communicating with your dog, common discipline problems, and obedience training.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454244</url></doc>
