<plot>A sporadic series on ABC late night parodying the then-new phenomenon of happy talk news. Guest stars included many of the satirists of the day, including Mort Sahl and Richard Pryor. Show was produced on an irregular schedule and was reportedly loathed by the real ABC affiliate news teams who refused to provide intros because they felt (rightly) they were being mocked. Cast featured alumni of Second City and other improv comedy theaters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019803</url></doc>
