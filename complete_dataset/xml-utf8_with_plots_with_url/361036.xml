<plot>A Broadway star, married but something of a playboy, visits his friend, a playwright who is working out a scene for his new play. He reads the scene to his actor friend who scoffs at its unreality. The conversation then takes a turn toward the romantic lives of the actor and his wife, and the actor soon learns that he was wrong about his friend's play being unrealistic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361036</url></doc>
