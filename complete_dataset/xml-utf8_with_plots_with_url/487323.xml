<plot>Two couples are at the seaside. A young man proposes to his gal. She accepts, and promptly tells him to re-tie his tie. He objects, so she returns the ring and walks away. An older couple has their own squabble: the middle-aged husband, who thinks himself a dandy, is happy to see his complaining wife roll away in a small, unattended carriage. He immediately approaches the younger woman. To make her ex-fianc√© jealous, she takes up with the dandy and off they go to swim. What of the wife and the jilted beau? Can things be set right?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?487323</url></doc>
