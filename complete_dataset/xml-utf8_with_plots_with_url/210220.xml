<plot>Paul Gardner runs a small market sundries shop on the edge of Spitalfields Market, East London. The shop has been run by his family for over 130 years, and as the latest Gardner to be in charge, with his calm manner and love of heavy metal, Paul has seen the shop through a dramatic period of change. Originally serving the old fruit and vegetable market, which moved away, Paul and the shop have found an audience in the new local businesses, and have drawn back previous customers who now travel quite far to visit, due to a mixture of unusual stock that the chaotic shop sometimes reveals, and the down-to-earth attitude with which Paul controls its day to day running.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210220</url></doc>
