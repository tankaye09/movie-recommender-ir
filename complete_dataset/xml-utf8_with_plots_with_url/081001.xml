<plot>A Hayseed and a clown jump into barrels and have a boxing bout. The clown knocks the countryman down, who is again assisted to his feet by an onlooker. The clown throws him down again, falling on top of him, and on rising the Rube is thrown on top of his own barrel, smashing it to pieces. A dog comes on the scene, and fastening himself to the bosom of the clown's trousers, he holds on while the frantic clown jumps wildly around.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081001</url></doc>
