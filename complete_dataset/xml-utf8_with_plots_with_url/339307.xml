<plot>LIVING ON WATER follows the true-life story of one couple who decides to buy an old cargo ship and turn it into a floating home. With Anna being Dutch and David, English, theirs is a relationship that bridges borders. Unable to decide on where they should settle down, they conclude that living on water offers the ideal solution. We follow their story from the initial excitement and anticipation of buying their house boat in Amsterdam, to their terrifying experience of crossing the English Channel without a pilot. Throughout, we experience their heartbreaking setbacks and hard won victories, undermined by both the relentless physical hardship and the emotional roller coaster of their unconventional life afloat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339307</url></doc>
