<plot>A mother lives a typical existence fulfilling domestic tasks and raising her young son. Her days are filled with soaped dishes, morning coffee, and time for her son to run through the yard and nap time. Gradually, her quiet domestic life is turned upside down as subtle oddities occur throughout the house. Dirty dishes are somehow magically done and doors somehow manage to open themselves in the middle of the night-all minor happenings that the mother does her best to overlook. Soon these oddities become too arduous to ignore, and the mother enters a world brimming with unimagined fear and uncertainty. It is up to her to recover her ordinary existence before something else seizes it from her grasp.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484280</url></doc>
