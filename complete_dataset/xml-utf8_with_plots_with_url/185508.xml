<plot>This film is really clever. Satan appears to a woman and on his first appearance is of ordinary stature. As he comes forward he grows larger until he assumes immense proportions, a veritable giant. The proverbial Fairy appears and Mephistopheles begins to contract until he is smaller than he was when he originally entered. Cleverly done.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185508</url></doc>
