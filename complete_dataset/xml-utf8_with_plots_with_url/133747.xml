<plot>Almost a hundred million Americans don't vote. Even when they're electing their president and, with that, the most powerful political leader in the world. A year before the presidential elections of 2008 a crew of young European filmmakers goes on a journey all across the country in a little old motor home to search for America's missing voters. Who are they? Why don't they vote? Can a young and fresh presidential candidate as Barack Obama make them vote? How would American politics change if more young people, single women, poor white people, African-Americans and Latino's would start voting? Who better than Oprah could get America's non-voters to vote in 2008.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133747</url></doc>
