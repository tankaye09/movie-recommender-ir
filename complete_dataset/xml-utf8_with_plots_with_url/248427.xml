<plot>A middle-aged stout gentleman is seen to enter his bathroom. After removing his trousers, he notices a little steam coming from the water in the bath-tub. He feels the water and finds it hot. In a rage, he rings for his valet, and when he arrives, chastises him for not attending properly to his business. The valet tries to make excuses. This angers the gentleman and he pushes the unfortunate fellow into the tub of hot water.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248427</url></doc>
