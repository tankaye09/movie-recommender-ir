<plot>All these couples and partners made their mark on the history of cinema. They were fascinating, fiery and always in the limelight. This series traces the public image of these stars at the moment they met their partner, putting it in a cultural, social and moral context. The stars often have stories to tell about the way Hollywood either covered up or fashioned american morals. The malicious little man and the polish vamp imposed their style on Hollywood in the 20's. But although Ernst Lubitsch managed to remain himself, Pola Negri lost her soul in the fantasy world of the star system.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?180569</url></doc>
