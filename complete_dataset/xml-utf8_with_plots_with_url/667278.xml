<plot>Young Survivor is a heartwarming story about struggling for survival in an uncompromising world. The "strugglers"are an Asian male (a small time drug dealer) and a Caucasian female (a corporate woman engaged to be married) Seemingly from two different worlds. Hackly(the Asian) and Sidney (the Caucasian) begin to recognize in each other what's missing in their own lives when their paths cross unintentionally. Their chances look grim. Hackly tries desperately to break his drug habit, but at the very least, is in danger by a vengeful enemy, a drug king-pin named Nike, and Sidney's life long commitment is on the rocks. Despite all the forces pulling them apart, they know they belong together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667278</url></doc>
