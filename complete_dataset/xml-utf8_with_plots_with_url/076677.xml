<plot>Juliette is attacked whilst walking home from school through the bluebell woods. She becomes pregnant as a result of the rape and after struggling with the decision, decides to keep the baby. Five years later she returns to the scene with her daughter to try to come to terms with what happened. During the assault Juliette focuses on the beauty of the bluebells in order to disassociate from the horrific ordeal: the bluebells give her strength and in effect 'save' her, and for this reason she has named her daughter after them as a symbol of survival. When her daughter asks about the origin of her name, however, Juliette is stunned and the question propels her back to the fateful events of that day, unlocking the secrets of the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076677</url></doc>
