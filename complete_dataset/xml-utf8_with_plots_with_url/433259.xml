<plot>While relaxing in his tree house, the Pink Panther becomes the victim of the pointy-nose guy, who in this cartoon is am employee of a lumber yard who has just cut down the tree his house was in, effectively destroying it. As a measure of revenge, the panther follows the man home and behind his back starts stealing his house from him piece by piece. As he notices everything is disappearing little by little (front door, back steps, fireplace, chimney, furniture, plumbing, walls, roof, etc.), the man first thinks its termites, then thieves, but the exterminator and police all think he's crazy, so he goes to a shrink, who confirms it. When the man tries to show the shrink his house, it's gone, and he goes insane, and gets taken to the happy home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433259</url></doc>
