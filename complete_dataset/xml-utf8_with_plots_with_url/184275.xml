<plot>Fun, but short-lived, game show which pits three married couples against one another. In the main game, the couples answer questions (usually true/false) in order to win points. Round 1 correct answers earned 2 points each, and round 2 answers earned 4 points each. The winning couple got their points converted to seconds, which is how long they have to try to win the bonus round. In the bonus round, the couple has a chance to win four prizes, each more expensive then the previous (with the third and fourth prize often being a trip and a car, respectively). In order to do this, they have to answer 4 questions correctly for the first prize, then 5 for the second, then 6 for the third, then seven to win the fourth prize. The questions are rapid fire, and are arranged in categories where each thing named off could be any one of three predetermined answers (fin/feather/fur, 1700s/1800s/1900s/, etc.). If the couple doesn't win the fourth prize, they are given $100 for each correct answer they got in that round.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184275</url></doc>
