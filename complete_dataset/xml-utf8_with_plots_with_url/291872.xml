<plot>This wordless animated film follows a tall, solitary adult as he walks from the video store, where he's rented the heavily-advertised "Killing Heinz," to his flat. Our pedestrian has close call after close call without noticing the narrow margins by which he avoids injury or death: from falling objects, a Bungee jumper, cars and trains, birds, a faulty balcony, and muggers. He arrives home, safe and sound, grabs a beer, and sits down to watch the movie. What could go wrong now?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291872</url></doc>
