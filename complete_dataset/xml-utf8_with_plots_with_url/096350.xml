<plot>Homosexuality has been judged, tried, and condemned by the Church. Castle Otttis stands in bold opposition. Built by two men with no plans, models, or expert help, the sculpture exists in honor of Jesus Christ, one who went against the religious leaders of his day to preach a message of Love. When a young filmmaker comes out to his parents and friends, he is told he should change, that with Christ, all things are possible. He flees to Castle Otttis to find refuge. Behind its walls, he experiences no judgment, no condemnation, no hate. Instead, he is welcomed into the arms of the King who only wants us to love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096350</url></doc>
