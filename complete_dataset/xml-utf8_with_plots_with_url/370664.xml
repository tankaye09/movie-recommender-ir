<plot>Inspired by "The Tell-Tale Heart" by Edgar Allan Poe. A mysterious character narrates a strange tale about taking care of his sister, who was critically injured in an accident that killed their parents. The narrator loves his sister, but loathes a mark left by the accident: her horrible deformed eye. He insists he isn't mad, despite the fact he decided to murder his sister because of that simple fact, by explaining the precautions he took to ensure he could safely do away with her and get away with it. However, he is driven to a raving confession in front of two cops by her beating heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370664</url></doc>
