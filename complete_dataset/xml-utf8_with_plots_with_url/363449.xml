<plot>On October 25th, 1415, as the pale dawn of an early autumn day broke over Agincourt, a mighty French Army numbering 30,000 men surveyed the small English force who stood before them ready to battle. The French expected a comprehensive victory, but as a day of great savagery unfolded it was the English led by their charismatic King, Henry V, who would utterly destroy their enemy. Agincourt: King Henry's Triumph features an accurate reconstruction of the great battle, plus dramatized eyewitness accounts taken from contemporary records.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363449</url></doc>
