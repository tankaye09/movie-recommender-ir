<plot>"A Road to Independence," is a dramatic and real story of personal growth seen through the life experiences of eight special needs students. Through a unique program called Lifelink, these students, who otherwise would never have gone beyond high school, attend college and take classes with age-appropriate peers. The hour-long documentary features the personal stories of these students and their struggle to gain critical life skills and navigate the world in new and challenging ways. Joe Myers spent one year among these students, facing with them their difficulties and their moments of joy and triumph on their individual journeys. A Road to Independence captures the emotion and impact as felt in the hearts of the Lifelink students.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015386</url></doc>
