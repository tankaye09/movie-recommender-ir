<plot>Featuring never-before-seen full and frank interviews with Best's past team mates, family and footballing friends and foes, plus personal, and at times moving contributions from some of the great names in British football including Sir Bobby Charlton, Nobby Stiles, Ron 'Chopper' Harris and Pat Crerand. Reading like a who's who in British footballing aristocracy, these legends in their own right give a rarely seen insight into Best as both player and person. The documentary also contains extensive footage from past matches showing the genius of Best in action, and sensationally dispels a number of popular myths about his departure from the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212580</url></doc>
