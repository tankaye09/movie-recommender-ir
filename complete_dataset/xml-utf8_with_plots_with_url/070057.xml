<plot>Yield to the call of the wild and the grandeur of the natural world with expert outdoorsman Mike Settino as he hunts game-and the good life-in BIGWOODS, an HD documentary series that takes a unique and exciting angle on the outdoor sportsman genre. Incorporating the esthetics of Nature, Martha Stewart and Cigar Aficionado, Mike and his friends hunt, fish and cook their way around the country, and the world, in extraordinarily scenic, and sometimes remote, locations where the thrill of the hunt also finds pause to contemplate our complex and complicated relationship with nature and technology. In BIG WOODS, the outdoor life really has never been so good, or so green.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070057</url></doc>
