<plot>Kumar lives a poor lifestyle in a village in India along with his mom, dad, Badri, and a younger brother, Arun. Kumar studies in Bombay, and is in love with wealthy Prabha, whose dad approves of him, and is even willing to loan him money to go abroad for further studies. But before the marriage could take place, Badri passes away, and as a result Kumar returns to the village so that Arun can go to Bombay, study, and make a better life for the entire family, leaving behind a heartbroken Prabha. Years later Kumar and Prabha are fated to meet again. This time Prabha will be a married woman - married to Bombay's Public Prosecutor, Mathur - who is prosecuting Kumar for using a gun to kill a woman named Kalpana!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366350</url></doc>
