<plot>Between family and friends, some rules should never be broken. An ordinary Saturday for Tito Gonzalez turns into a day the will change the lives of himself and his best friend, Eddie, forever. A talk with his cousin alerts Tito that he's been double crossed, and after going to Eddie for help, the two uncover the startling truth which forces Tito into the biggest decision of his life. Love, hate, betrayal, despair and revenge lead to a film featuring a "clever ending" with "good tension through the end" (Michael Trent, "Dances with Films").</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470268</url></doc>
