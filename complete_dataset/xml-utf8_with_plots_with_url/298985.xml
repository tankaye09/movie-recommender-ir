<plot>Thakur Shamsher Singh lives a wealthy life that is funded chiefly by criminal activities such smuggling and dealing in drugs. He has never been arrested as he has several high-ranking politicians and Police Officials on his 'payroll'. When an Editor of a newspaper exposes him, he has the entire family ruthlessly killed. When he finds out that Superintendent of Police Kundan Singh has been transferred from Delhi especially to apprehend him, he initially befriends him, but when he finds out that Kundan cannot be brought, he concocts a devious plot that will ensnare Kundan, his wife, Parvat, pet dog and monkey - so that he can continue to remain the uncrowned king of the underworld.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?298985</url></doc>
