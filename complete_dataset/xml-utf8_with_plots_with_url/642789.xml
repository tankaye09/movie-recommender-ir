<plot>Set in a dilapidated village of Macedonia, Voda follows the melancholic loneliness of an elderly woman Mara, whose family is forced to travel abroad in search of a better life. Mara longs for the company of her grandchildren and is haunted by the memory of them. Old pictures and postcards, hung on the walls of her house, are the only indication that once she led a full and happy life. Mara spends her time visiting her husband's grave and praying in church for her family to come back soon. On a stormy day in the village, she receives word from her loved ones. Everything changes that day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?642789</url></doc>
