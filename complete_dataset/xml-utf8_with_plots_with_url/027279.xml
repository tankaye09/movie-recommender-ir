<plot>Aizea - City of the Wind tells the story of a woman who has challenged the law of her town. She falls in love with a foreigner, knowing that all contact with strangers is strictly forbidden. This prohibition has its roots in a legend from the distant past. Aida is punished by the Gods. Her decision to marry a foreigner turns her life upside down. On her wedding day, an enormous windstorm arrives and destroys Aizea. Assed, Aida's fiance is taken away by the wind until he disappears completely within the clouds. From this day on, Aida experiences the rejection of the villagers. However, she never loses the hope or belief that she will be reunited with her fiance. Her waiting is shared with the fruit of the love between her and her lost fiance: Raul, Aida's son. Like his mother, Raul hopes that one day the"angels" will bring back his father and in his dream world he talks to the stars. The faith, the patience and the purity of the mother and her son will be rewarded. The accidental stop of a salesman in Aizea, develops into an event that will change their lives forever. After seven years, Angela, the woman who has always been listening to Raul's desires, finally abandons Aizea's law in order to give to those who truly believe in love, what they deserve, no matter what had happened in the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027279</url></doc>
