<plot>Shekhar Choudhry is an aspiring and struggling young man whose goal is to become a movie director in Bollywood movies. He is thrilled and excited when renowed producer K.C. Mehra summons him, and informs him that he would like him to direct a movie. Mr. Mehra explains that the only condition that is attached to this offer is that he must travel to the U.S. and meet with former actress, Anupama Joshi, and convince her to take the lead role in this movie. Shekhar readily agrees to this, not realizing that Mr. Mehra has an ulterior motive of sending him to bring in Anupama.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664572</url></doc>
