<plot>Bhuvan Shome is a lonely widower, a proud old man and a strict disciplinarian. Looking back on the trodden path, strewn with staunch determination and drab attitudes, Bhuvan Shome, a throughtly unenchanted man, seeks escape in a holiday. Off to duck shooting in Gujarat, Bhuvan Shome little ralises that the rejuvenation adventure would hurl him into a world so apart that he would find it the most joyful experience in his life. His new world consists of simple, uninitiated village folks, a bullock-cart drive, marauding buffalo and Gouri. In Gouri, Bhuvan Shome finds a fresh, throbbing pulse in a dying world. And suddenly everything lights up, perhaps heightening his sense of isolation, in his new found joy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068381</url></doc>
