<plot>Lukas is a twenty something filing clerk living alone in his apartment. Post 7/7, he is forced daily to confront the common perceptions of Islam; the images of religious fanaticism, a failure to integrate into British society and a opposing set of cultural values. He is forced to reckon with the Muslim presence in his immediate society when prompted by the sight of a local mosque upon his daily journey to/from work. In the loneliness of his apartment he has only the media for company through which his perception of Islam grows increasing blurred and fragmented.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152153</url></doc>
