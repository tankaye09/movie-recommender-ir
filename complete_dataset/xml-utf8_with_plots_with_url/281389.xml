<plot>Beirut, July 2006. The Israeli bombings strike Lebanon. Waël Noureddine begins a journey across his country. Although the film is not a documentary, its real life images are gripping. Using 16 mm film and HDV, this film questions the underlying principles of the documentary genre. The cameras capture a country in a state of terror and record the immediate effects of the war on civilians. Waël Noureddine films what we' re afraid to confront, and he's subsequently become a sensational icon with the press- a head-on encounter with death. Viewers experience Lebanese daily life- we feel the impact of bombings, touch the victims, and hear the deafening silence after bombings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281389</url></doc>
