<plot>Homeless youth in Phoenix Arizona continue to face an ongoing problem leaving them option less. When they reach the age of 18 they are no longer legally able to receive foster care and they cannot legally check into a homeless shelter until the age of 21. This leaves a large number of the homeless youth with basically no help or stability from outside resources. HomeBase Youth Services has provided a safe haven and additional resources for this age group of homeless youth who are often considered 'the forgotten population.' This documentary focuses on the problem facing the city of Phoenix and the dedication and volunteer support of HomeBase Youth Services and community volunteers who are making a difference.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558850</url></doc>
