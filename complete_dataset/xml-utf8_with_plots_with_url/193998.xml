<plot>"A strictly up-to-date picture is this and one that everyone is anxious to see. Being several thousand miles away and depending entirely on newspaper reports, one is charmed to see a real battle between the British and the Boers, portrayed by moving pictures, full life size. The scene opens, showing the English in retreat rushing down a steep hill and through a ravine until they emerge on an open plain. They fire continually over their shoulders at the enemy, who return the fire and a number are seen to fall. The English rally and attempt to resist, but they are outnumbered and beat a hasty retreat, leaving many dead and wounded. The picture closes, showing the Boers in hot pursuit, and after the main army passes, their soldiers with litters are seen carrying away those who have fallen. This is a stirring picture, full of life and action. The smoke effect is beautiful."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193998</url></doc>
