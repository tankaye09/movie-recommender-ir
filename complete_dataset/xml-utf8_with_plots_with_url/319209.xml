<plot>Shows first a family of Laps outside their hut, then a life-sized picture of two men holding antlers; afterwords two women (one of whom is smoking) with a pretty little Lap child. The picture shows the facial expressions of this marvelous race of people, who smear their bodies with oil, dress in skins, and live on the flesh of the reindeer, which they shepherd. After many objections had been overcome, they were persuaded to collect their reindeer from the hills, and bring them down to be kinetographed, when a picture was obtained of a herd of over 200 deer. A unique picture, and one of realistic interest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319209</url></doc>
