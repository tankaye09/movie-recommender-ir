<plot>Our hero is Murphy, an ET hunter; a real, bona fide, bob's your uncle hunter. But he has a big problem: nothing ever works like it's supposed to...especially when he is trying to catch Puck, a big, really, really annoying (and that's being polite)...bug! And as if being a walking catastrophe weren't enough, Murphy has competition: there is another, super bounty hunter also trying to catch Puck...a bounty hunter whose dubious methods are worthy of Inspector Harry : El Roacho. The two of them are going to fight tooth and nail with each other because Puck is worth a lot of money, a real lot of money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085883</url></doc>
