<plot>Nothing like that antiquated picture of "Feeding the Doves," but a new, up-to-date picture, showing the natives of Venice in front of that old, famous St. Mark's church, feeding the pigeons. This is a most beautiful picture. Nothing is more beautiful in motion pictures than flying birds, and this picture is the premier of them all. This picture always produces an encore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191650</url></doc>
