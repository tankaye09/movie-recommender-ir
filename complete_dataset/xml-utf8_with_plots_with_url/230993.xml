<plot>Episode 1 - "A Renter's Market" Starving actor, Hart Massey decides to rent an apartment in the Annex neighborhood. Hart Massey, a starving Toronto actor, brings home a cute date under the pretense that he has his own place. When his date finds out that he still lives with his father, Walter, she abandons him forcing the actor to reconsider his lifestyle. So Hart finds an apartment in the Annex that is perfect for his needs. Cheap. But this is only the result of a renter's market currently facing all landlords in Toronto. With so many condos around, Hart can easily talk down his new landlord, The Duke of Davenport. But can Hart provide him with a reference letter from a boss he doesn't have? Not when he's an unemployed actor, he can't. Hence his search for employment begins. From carpentry, to teaching, to waiting tables, to tailoring, Hart tries his hand at anything and fails every time. But when Hart stumbles upon an eccentric owner of a second hand clothing shop, he finds himself working in retail. Will this be enough to keep his place?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230993</url></doc>
