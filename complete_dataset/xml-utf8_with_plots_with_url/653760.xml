<plot>Nikki is young woman in the midst of a personal crisis. After the loss of her husband she struggles to retain some form of normality in her life by leaving the past behind and moving in with her best friend Mia. Nikki finds herself in a daily struggle to understand "why" following the sudden death of her husband Craig. Nikki begins to experience flashbacks of the times she spent with her husband. These flashbacks provide a glimpse into what life was like for Nikki and Craig as a married couple. Although Nikki and Craig had been together for a number of years prior to marrying, their married life was very tremulous and short lived due to Craig recent but numerous infidelities. Mia attempts to help Nikki move on with her life by inviting her out to a popular nightclub to mix and mingle with other young singles. While out, Nikki is approached by a young record producer named Darren. Darren takes and immediate interest in Nikki and the chase persists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653760</url></doc>
