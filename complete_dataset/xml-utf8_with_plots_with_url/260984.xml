<plot>"Do They Know It's Christmas?" was the single that gave birth to Live Aid, the world's biggest rock concert and TV event. This was organized by Bob Geldof in the Fall of 1984 for the sake of charity to raise money for people starving in Ethiopia. The project would become the template and the inspiration for a number of other charitable recordings and live events to benefit various causes around the world and marked a new era of raised social consciousness for many entertainers as well as their fans.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260984</url></doc>
