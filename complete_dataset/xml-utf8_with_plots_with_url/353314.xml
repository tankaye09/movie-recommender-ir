<plot>The NFL/NFL Films held a national contest where fans could pitch their ideas for the best NFL commercial ever! Fans came to three cities across the country where they pitched their ideas in front of NFL athletes and NFL creatives. 12 finalists were chosen and voted on by fans. This 30 minute special (hosted by Rich Eisen and Cutter Garcia) features the re-cap of the three city tour as well as three featured finalists chosen by the celebrity judges. The winner sees their commercial idea shot by Joe Pytka and shown during the 2007 Superbowl.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353314</url></doc>
