<plot>Shot with two cameras in digital wide-screen 2004 and 2005, this is the first ever in-depth look on film at the errors and omissions in today's electrical physics and the inventors (and their devices) who have exploited these gaping holes to pioneer the production of free electrical energy from the infinite vacuum all around us. Additional filming also took place in 2006 for a total of over 100 hours of new film, plus archival footage from the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178579</url></doc>
