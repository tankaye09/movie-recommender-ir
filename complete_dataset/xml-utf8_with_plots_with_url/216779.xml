<plot>A featurette with Jay Jostyn, radio and television's "Mister District Attorney", appearing as the prosecutor at a trial in which a minister, teacher, town mayor and a father are all found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. The guilt, according to the judge, lies in the sin of omission on the part of each of the four adults rather than in any specific act of the boy. An early example of the current trend of laying blame rather than taking responsibility for one's own misdeeds. Probably not a big hit at PTA meetings, which is about the only place it was ever booked. Once.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216779</url></doc>
