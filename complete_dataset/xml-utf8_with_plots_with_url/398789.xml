<plot>"No Way Get F*#ked, F*#k Off!" is a fly-on-the-wall account of an iconic Australian band's uneasy reconciliation. Thirty years ago The Angels were kings of the Australian rock scene. Eight and a half years ago lead singer Doc Neeson walked out of the band. One year ago he and the rest of the original members were talking through lawyers in a bitter legal battle over naming rights. And then Doc's manager David Edwards had an idea. Instead of tearing each other apart, why don't they just put the band back together again? That was the start of an uncertain journey as the five original members Doc Neeson, John &amp; Rick Brewster, Chris Bailey and Buzz Bidstrup try to re-discover the magic that made the legend. "No Way Get F*#ked, F*#k Off!" documents the combustible reconciliation of one of Australia's most famous rock bands The Angels, as the original members attempt to leave their baggage at the door and rekindle old friendships on camera and on stage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398789</url></doc>
