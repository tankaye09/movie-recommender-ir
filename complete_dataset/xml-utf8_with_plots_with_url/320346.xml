<plot>During an intense nighttime skirmish between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces, buddies Shane and Matt tumble into a bomb crater moments after a barrage of bullets assail them. Shane escapes serious injury but Matt is hit and rapidly losing blood from a gunshot to the leg. Unable to pull Matt to safety, Shane makes a decision - to save his friend, he must leave him alone and run for help. Now by himself, Matt confronts his own mortality and when an explosion leaves him deaf, he cannot hear the radio blaring Shane's return with reinforcements. As enemies and friends approach Matt's position, who will Matt kill with his last bullet?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320346</url></doc>
