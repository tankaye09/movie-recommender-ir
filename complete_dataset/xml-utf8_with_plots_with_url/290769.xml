<plot>While definitely "kickboxing-inspired," this unusually well-designed workout also integrates innovative step aerobic, floor cardio, aero/tone and toning exercises. Unlike some kickbox programs, the aerobics never slow down - it's all non-stop, high-energy, fat-burning fun. The movements are uncomplicated but challenging - they include aerobic/anaerobic intervals, simple step moves and "The Firm-like" cardio-with-dumbbells segments (for increased intensity). There's a fresh feel with many unique twists on classic routines (e.g. the body bar is used as a traditional weight and a martial arts blocking stick). It ends with a solid core strength and balance routine. Well-cued by Kimberly Spreen. Requires 2 to 5 lb. dumbbells and a body bar.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290769</url></doc>
