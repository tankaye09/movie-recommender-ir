<plot>A Peruvian film that tells the story of the bank robberies' legend, Orlando Gonzáles best known as Django. This movie shows the intense life of this character; not only focusing in the robberies, but also in the reasons that pushed him into acting the way he did. Django is a character that decides to fight against his luck because he doesn't accept the poverty he's destined for. After being away from the capital, he comes back with his wife and kids to continue with his crimes. However, Tania, his wife, tries to push him away from his criminal life, with no success. Melissa, who will drag him into a world of passion and crime, will soon meet him. They will live without thinking in the consequences, getting into a world where they won't be able to escape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152805</url></doc>
