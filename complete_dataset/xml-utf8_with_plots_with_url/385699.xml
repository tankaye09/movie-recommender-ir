<plot>'MYTHS FOR PROFIT' is a dramatic, expos√©; documentary which explores 'Canada's role in Industries of War and Peace'. Through diverse interviews and case studies this documentary unveils the specific interests and profits that are made by certain corporation, individuals and agency within Canada. The Canadian government and the military would like us to believe that we are altruistic peacekeepers helping people around the world. But is this accurate? 'MYTHS FOR PROFIT' examines these stories and the motivations behind them. The documentary investigates how these misconception are maintained and who stands to gain. By understanding the systems of power in Canada we can move forward in challenging how they operate and collectively create change.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385699</url></doc>
