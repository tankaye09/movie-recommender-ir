<plot>Two thirty something men from New York City, Tito the superintendent of a small building, and Andrew a tenant, and close friend embark in a investigation of a series of occurrences and disappearances in their building. Tito is a crime-story writer by vocation, Andrew, is a bartender and actor wanna be; both love adventures but Andrew always gets himself into trouble because his big mouth. Adina, another tenant, hires them to spy on her husband Joe, whom she suspects infidelity. The pay is very good and the two take the job. They realized her husband is unfaithful but not the way she suspects. Tito and Andrew catch Joe in a compromised situation, but become involved in a dangerous cat and mouse game. The table's turns, and the two characters realize Adina is a vampire looking for the Vortex, an opening to another dimension. Soon thereafter, Joe is violently killed when he's thrown into the Vortex. Adina shows up at Tito's apartment and threats him with killing Andrew if Tito doesn't show her the Vortex. What happens if Adina goes into the Vortex? Where would she exit?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599444</url></doc>
