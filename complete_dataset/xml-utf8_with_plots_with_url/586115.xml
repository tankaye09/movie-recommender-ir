<plot>Three contestants were given $250. Jack Barry would give the contestants a category for the round, and contestants would announce how much they would wager. Barry would reveal a question related to the topic, and after the contestants wrote their answer, a film clip where the answer was revealed was shown. After the clip, Jack would offer toss-up questions about the category that were worth $25 apiece. For the final question, contestants would risk all or part of their winnings, and Jack would reveal three items related to the final clip. The one who had the most money at the end of the show won the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586115</url></doc>
