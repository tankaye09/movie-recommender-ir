<plot>The story of Sister Elizabeth Wheeler, who under the direction of Florence Nightingale, assisted wounded British soldiers in the Crimean War. She was later dismissed for exposing the atrocities of poor and shoddy care to wounded soldiers. She traveled to America where she cared for wounded Confederate soldiers in the Civil War. General Robert E Lee himself honored Elizabeth Wheeler for her service to the Confederate Army. She used a surname of Elizabeth Williams in the US because she left England in disgrace for telling the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581612</url></doc>
