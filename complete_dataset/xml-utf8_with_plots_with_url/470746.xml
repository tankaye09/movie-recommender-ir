<plot>Michael and Eddie are life long friends and recent college graduates who rent an "apartment garage" from Stan, a blind old war veteran. As they begin their tumultuous transition into the real world, their friendship evolves as Michael realizes that he has more in common with Stan than he does with his best friend. While Eddie is desperate to find a "real" job and get as far away from his parents as possible, Michael wishes he could go back to the house he grew up in before his parents died. It's a story about a transition we all make, one in which accepting the inevitable changes in life means you have to slow down to move ahead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470746</url></doc>
