<plot>HIGH OR DRY is a portrait of two middle-class heroin users and the people around them. Mark is a magnetic, all-consuming presence who affects everyone around him, but, as the film unflinchingly observes, his self-destructive addiction threatens everything he holds close. Whether Mark and his friends are finding a way to escape their problems, confronting them, or are finding a way to get clean or get on, HIGH OR DRY captures these parts of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239120</url></doc>
