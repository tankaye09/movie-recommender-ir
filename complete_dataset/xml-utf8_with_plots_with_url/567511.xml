<plot>The extraordinary life and widely varied achievements of one of America's greatest heroes. The documentary presents exclusive interviews with John Glenn, his close friends and associates. Included is rarely seen behind-the-scenes footage of his dangerous and harrowing early space mission, as he became the first American to orbit the earth; followed decades later by his extensive preparation for the space shuttle mssion, and his eventual triumphant return to space as the worlds oldest practicing astronaut. Friends and colleagues, from former Press Secretary Mike McCurry to baseball great Ted Williams provide insightful and moving stories about this enigmatically understated yet uniquely driven American hero.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567511</url></doc>
