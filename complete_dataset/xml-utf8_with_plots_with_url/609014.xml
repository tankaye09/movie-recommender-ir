<plot>A murdered wife. A jealous husband. A jilted lover. And a frightened friend. All of them in the same apartment at the same time. Three of them setting aside bitter differences and better judgment in the hope of earning a ten million dollar payday. When Michael Taylor, a washed-up artist, discovers that his wife has been murdered in the upstairs bedroom of their swanky loft, the decision about what to do next isn't nearly as easy as it seems. That's because downstairs he's hosting an impromptu cocktail party for two wealthy fans who are very interested in purchasing his latest work. Michael, who hasn't sold a painting in over five years, convinces Marti, his wife's dedicated assistant, and Dominick, a young artist who has been mentored by Michael and seduced by his wife, that they should all keep quiet and close the deal. Despite being uncertain about each other's motives, and still wondering whether or not one of them is in fact the killer, they form a pact to shut up and sell the work. They soon find out that's much easier said than done.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?609014</url></doc>
