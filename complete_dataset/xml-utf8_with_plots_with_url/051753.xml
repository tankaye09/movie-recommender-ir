<plot>In this surreal dark comedy, young and downtrodden Cotterfield Potts has been called upon to travel to Australia to save his family's business. Not that the family wants him to go - he's simply their only choice. But before he leaves, he must first journey home to visit the Potts clan one last time. He encounters his siblings as home draws closer, and old tensions build into familial brawls. Simultaneously, Cotterfield begins to have waking dreams of strange Australian landscapes, complete with hordes of magical kangaroos. As his family collapses, Cotterfield must decide if he will go to Australia at all, and what that trip might mean. *Portions of 'Australia' were filmed at the Kangaroo Conservation Center of Dawsonville, Georgia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?051753</url></doc>
