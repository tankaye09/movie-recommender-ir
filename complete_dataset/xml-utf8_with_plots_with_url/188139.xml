<plot>Dan, a senior in high school, has his daily routine; get out of bed, get on his flip flops, call his girlfriend, go to school. Dan's mother is constantly encouraging him to start focusing on himself, while Dan is only interested in calling his girlfriend who just went away to college. Dan is having trouble at school. It is almost November, he hasn't done his college applications, and he is still in flip flops. He and his best friend are also not on speaking terms because Dan constantly blew him off over the summer for his girlfriend. It isn't until Dan's flip flop breaks, that he realizes it may be time for him to make some changes: It may be time for him to fall forward.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188139</url></doc>
