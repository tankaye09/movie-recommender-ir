<plot>In this film by Octavio Warnock-Graham, a bi-racial son confronts his mother and her refusal to acknowledge that he is of African American descent. While trying to understand his mother's choice, the filmmaker discovers that too often the truth reveals itself in the unspoken. Silences is both an intimate personal journey as well as an intense family drama that explores the universal question that every child asks and every parent dreads, 'Why didn't you give me that thing that I needed?' Set in Maumee, Ohio, the filmmaker struggles to understand his mother, Harriet Warnock, and her refusal to discuss his birth. For the son, one lingering problem remains, a question that no one in the family has been asked or can answer; Silences is not about race and it is not about shame. It's about the problems that every parent faces in raising a child and every child faces in coming to terms with the choices, for better or for worse, that a parent makes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496858</url></doc>
