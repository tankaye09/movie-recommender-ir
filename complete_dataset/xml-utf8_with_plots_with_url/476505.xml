<plot>Documentary, following Sandy Denny's way too short musical odyssey, from her earliest days in the folk scene, her work with Strawbs, Trever Lucus, her reinventing Fairport Convention and their unique contributions, to Fotheringay, and her solo work. Overwhelmingly a talking head documentary, with music writers Patrick Humphries, Colin Irwin, and Nigel Williamson, as well as Fairport bandmates Dave Mattacks, David Swarbrick, and Gerry Conway, but with Richard Thompson sadly, mysteriously completely absent. John Renborn is also interviewed. NOTE: There are only very very brief inclusions of actual music performances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476505</url></doc>
