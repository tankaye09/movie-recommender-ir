<plot>An ex-mobster Tony Angelini and a shady real estate broker Sam Jones run for Mayor of the small town of Beach City. Unfortunately there is a tie and the deciding vote has to be cast by Luther Pendergrass, a man so repulsive he was run out of town by the townspeople prior to the election. Now the two of them have to sneak him back into town to vote. Except Luther wants more then this to be his civic duty, howabout a new house and to date Angelini's girlfriend Miss Fish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184300</url></doc>
