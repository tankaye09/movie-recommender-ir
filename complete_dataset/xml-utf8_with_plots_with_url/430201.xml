<plot>After twenty years in the pop business, this is a celebration of the lives, work, and achievements of the Pet Shop Boys. Following Neil's education and upbringing in Newcastle, and Chris's in Blackpool, the two head separately to London where they meet and begin writing, ending up with their classic "West End Girls". Over two decades and ?? albums, they go from strength to strength, revealing their work methods and abetted by comments from musicians Robbie Williams, Jake Shears ("Scissor Sisters"), Brandon Flowers ("The Killers"), amongst others. Their musical variations are discussed including the musical "Closer to Heaven" and writing a new score to accompany Eisenstein's "Battleship Potemkin", performed live in London's Trafalgar Square. A panoramic portrait. Available as a 48-min TV documentary and a 140-minute DVD.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430201</url></doc>
