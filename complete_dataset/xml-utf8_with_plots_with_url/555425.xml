<plot>1996 FCC act caused many stations to be bought and sold at random. The End of the World As We Knew It, tells of one station that was self owned and did what ever the hell they wanted to. In 1996 though, the station was sold to Clear Channel and soon after they were forced to change formats. The story is told through the people who knew the station best, the disc jockeys. Also we hear from bands of the 90's Alt-rock era who give their side to the story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555425</url></doc>
