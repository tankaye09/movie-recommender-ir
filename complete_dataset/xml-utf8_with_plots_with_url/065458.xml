<plot>"A piece of jewellery must be beautiful. It must be a small piece of art that brings joy to the wearer. It brings joy to the giver, just as it brought me joy to create it." BENT GABRIELSEN is a Danish goldsmith,a worthy representative of Danish Design. This film features his life and work as recounted by himself during the course of a day. It is a low-key, poetic film illustrating his daily life, his working habits, his memories of his childhood and of the Second World War period, his own death experience and his views on contemporary craftsmanship. BENT GABRIELSEN has won many prizes and has had many exhibitions around the world,in Japan and elsewhere.For all this recognition,he is still a very modest man.He lives in beautiful surroundings, close to a lake where silence and nature are united.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065458</url></doc>
