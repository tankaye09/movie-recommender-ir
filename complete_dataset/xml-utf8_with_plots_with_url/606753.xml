<plot>Bill Underwood (Tim Holt) falls out with his father (Gordon DeMain) and chooses the life of a cowhand rather than take charge of his father's stage line. He and his pals Smokey Ryan (Ray Whitley) and Whopper Hatch (Lee "Lasses" White), on the road to Durango, prevent a holdup of the Kellogg Stage Line, which the elder Underwood has being trying to buy. Underwood's agent, attorney Steve Farley (Archie Twitchell), has been doublecrossing him in the negotiations by misrepresenting the offer. In Durango, Bill finds that Farley has been corrupting the stage drivers working for Kellogg (Charles Phipps) and his daughter Nancy (Luana Walters.) Using the assumed name of Bill Dawson, Bill hires out to drive for the Kelloggs. Farley attempts to plant stolen mail with Bill, but Bill and his pals defeat an ambush intended as part of the plan, but Farley learns his real identity and informs Nancy that he is an Underwood spy. She fires Bill and, in order to save a mail contract, intends to drive the stage herself. Knowing that Farley's men intend to hold up the stage, Bill and his pals do it themselves, but deliver the mail to its intended destination. Mr. Underwood comes to Durango to expose Farley's treachery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606753</url></doc>
