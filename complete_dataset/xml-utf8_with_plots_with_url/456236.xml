<plot>The evil Nevar threatens the peaceful existence of Raven's childhood homeland, the island of Alaunus, when he captures the Enchanted Oak and begins to cut Staves of Power for his hooded demons. An exiled Raven enlists the help of his trusted friend, Princess Erina, and her sprite companion, Haryad, as well as the wise old astronomer, Cyrus. Together, they guide three teams of four young warriors who must overcome the challenges on the island and collect timepieces, which will be used with the coming solar eclipse to free the island from Nevar's grip.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?456236</url></doc>
