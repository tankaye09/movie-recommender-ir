<plot>A documentary film about Sherman Arch, who began protecting iguanas on his personal property in the early 80's after realizing that the population of the creatures was dwindling due to excessive hunting. Now, 27 years later he has over 3,500 iguanas roaming his 10-acre "farm" and he continues to educate and entertain thousands of visitors each year about the dangers of over-hunting and poaching that threatens this animals' existence on the island.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044713</url></doc>
