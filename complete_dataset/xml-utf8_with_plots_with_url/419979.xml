<plot>Valdez is the headquarters for the rich Copper River country that lies in the Eastern part of the great Alaskan Northwest. The only means of transporting supplies to this district is by pack train, or on the backs of men and dogs. This view shows a heavily laden pack train in charge of long haired Western cowboy packers passing up the main street of Valdez, Alaska, bound for the Bonanza and Nicoli Copper Mines. A most typical scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419979</url></doc>
