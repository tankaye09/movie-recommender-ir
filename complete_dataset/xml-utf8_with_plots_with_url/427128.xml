<plot>In the days before Paul Little goes off to college, he and his sister, Melanie, relate the story of their relationship. They relate the incidents that led their relationship to become incestuous, how it developed, and what eventually drove the two of them apart. They also discuss their unique pledge that they would only eat peaches with one another (never alone, never with anyone else), and the effect that had on the ultimate decisions they would make.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427128</url></doc>
