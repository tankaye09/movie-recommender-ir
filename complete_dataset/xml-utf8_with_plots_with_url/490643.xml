<plot>Fresh off the prison block and back on the streets, Brody is determined to set his life straight. Tired of the troubled streets he knows, he offers his time to assist a former youth councilor working with kids on the edge of the system. But what begins as an opportunity to change someone else's life soon threatens to destroy his own. With long term girlfriend Lisa on one side and the savage gang leader Lewis hungry for blood on the other, Brody is caught between the path he wants to walk, and the streets he can't avoid.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490643</url></doc>
