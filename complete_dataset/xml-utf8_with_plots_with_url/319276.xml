<plot>In a desperate attempt to get a job for Ken Daniels and Alvino Rey and his Orchestra, agent Mike Simms plots to make Daniels a missing heir. Simms hires Austin J. Caldwell to pose as an attorney and go to Gus Borelli, owner of the swank Blue Room, asking if he has heard about Daniels' inheritance. Borelli, figuring he can cut in on the money, bright Daniels and Simms to the Blue Room just as Pamela Mason is rehearsing some songs with Zybisco and his string quintet. Simms refuses to let Daniels sing with the quintet,saying he has already made arrangements with Alvino Rey to bring his orchestra and the King Sisters (Alyce, Donna, Louise and Yvonne King) into the Blue Room. This causes Pamela to lose her job and she is furious with Daniels, who tells her he will get her a job with the Rey orchestra. Later, she discovers the hoax tells Borelli, who sets out to kill Daniels and Simms. They, and the orchestra, manage to escape just as the Blue Room is filling with customers drawn by Borelli's heavy advertising of Daniel's debut. He sends Pamela to bring them back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319276</url></doc>
