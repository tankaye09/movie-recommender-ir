<plot>Their friendship began in El Salvador, where they spent 2 1/2 years serving the Peace Corps. Now Preston, Seth, Mateo and Adam are back together after two years apart for a wild weekend in Las Vegas. Sin City means losing their shirt at the blackjack table and struggling to seduce women at every turn. But their Lost Weekend is also jammed with adventure: indoor skydiving, bungee jumping, and a race around the Las Vegas Speedway at 130 miles per hour. Will anyone hit the jackpot with the ladies? And who will end up running through the parking lot in their underpants?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343716</url></doc>
