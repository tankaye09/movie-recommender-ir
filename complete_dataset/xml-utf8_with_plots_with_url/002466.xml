<plot>15-40 tells the true story of tennis player Kai Hansen. An unflinching competitor, Kai Hansen is well on his way to winning a spot at the European championships in Sweden. Under a comfortable Nazi occupation, Kai's world is limited to the court and to the many luxuries that his status affords him. In order for Kai to realize his dream of participating in the European Championships in Sweden, he has to defeat aging tennis great, Erik Bjarnson. But when it is discovered that Erik, might in fact be a Jew, and that a massive deportation of Danish Jews is planned by the Nazis, Kai has to decide whether to risk it all or for his countrymen or remain veiled in a life of pride and privilege.</plot><plot>15-40 tells the true story of tennis player Kai Hansen.
