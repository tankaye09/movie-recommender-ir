<plot>The Reluctant Narrator is a series of absurd videos about how we make assumptions in our deciphering of the world. The videos are comprised primarily of found sound and video footage with original monologues. There are five videos to date in this series. These videos can be screened together or individually. In constructing the narratives in these videos, we are juxtaposing the rational against the irrational through everyday imagery of contemporary North American life. The scenarios in each of these videos are comprised of illogical narratives that are dealt with in a logical manner. These videos are simultaneously familiar and opaque. This is a world where the viewers are forced to suspend their disbelief and, at the same time, asked to critique the ambiguity of the narrative that has been presented. The viewers are then left to come to their own conclusions about not only what is true or believable but also what they understand to be the underlying message of each video.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586253</url></doc>
