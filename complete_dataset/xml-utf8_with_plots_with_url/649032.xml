<plot>Uses still photographs, home movies, film clips, theatrical trailers, newsreel footage, and a woman's voice speaking for her to tell the actress's story. She grew up close to Hollywood, her mother in and out of institutions, never knowing her father, living in foster care and with relatives. She does some modeling and her film career starts slowly. By "Gentlemen Prefer Blonds," she's a star, but still paid $500/week by Fox. She hates being type-cast and tries her hand at independent productions. She suffers from stage fright and keeps an acting coach close at hand. Marriages, pills, and drinking bring little relief. She's happiest in front of cheering soldiers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649032</url></doc>
