<plot>When Drew, an aspiring armed robber, gets some desperately needed on-the-job-training from a wily jewelry store owner, he winds up with more than improved job skills. As Drew exits the store, he serendipitously bumps into cupid disguised as a lanky skateboarder who hands him a cell phone and a chance at destiny.  Just moments before, the phone was dropped by Candice, a beautiful woman who unwittingly happened by the jewelry store as the robbery was underway. Once she realizes her cell is gone, Candice calls her own number and arranges to meet Drew and retrieve her phone.  They meet and Drew is mesmerized by her.  He risks it all by asking her out for a drink.  Unaware that he is the masked thief from the jewelry store robbery, she agrees. And, the rest, as they say, is history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183981</url></doc>
