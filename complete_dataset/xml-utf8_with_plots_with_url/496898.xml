<plot>7 years ago, Jutah Fate was ordered to destroy the enemy stronghold by his commanding officer, however, it was actually a civilian's residence and countless of innocent people were burned to death and murdered. Feeling with lots of guilts, Jutah was ordered to burn everything to the ground and was imprisoned for 7 years for his unintentional actions. Now 7 years later, Jutah was released from his imprisonment and joins a group of soldiers led by his commanding officer, Annri Ohara. The team was ordered to eliminate the large mothership Dante. Just as Annri's teams' dropship launches, one of the enemy attacks shot the dropship and as it crashes, Jutah ended up separated from his team. Armed with bomb dispensers on both arms and radio communication from his commanding officer, Jutah must find his teammates, destroy the threats inside the Dante and at the same time, finding out Benoit Manderubrot's suspicious reaction to Jutah. Will Jutah succeed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496898</url></doc>
