<plot>On his way home after what has clearly been a long period of absence, a man dies in a train crash. However, desperately wanting to see his beloved wife one last time, he is allotted a few extra days by Mr. Death himself. Unnoticed, he follows his wife home after attending his own funeral and witnesses her making love to another man. In an ultimate gesture of true and unselfish love, he decides not to interfere and, finally, accepts to die.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218393</url></doc>
