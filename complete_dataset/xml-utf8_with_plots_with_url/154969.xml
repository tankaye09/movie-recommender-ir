<plot>Dominick Dunne is known for successful novels, as an investigative journalist and writer for Vanity Fair Magazine ans as the presenter of Dominick Dunne's Power Priviledge and Justice on Court TV. His life story could have come straight out of any of these. When his daughter was murdered by her boyfriend in 1982, he covered the trial for Vanity Fair, it was his first article called Justice. In this piece he talked about the rage he felt and how he hated the judge who let the murderer off with only 2 years of a prison sentence, because the murderer had employed one of the top defense attorney. Dominick Dunne understood that money buys you more chances at law. Since he has covered for Vanity Fair most of the celebrity cases as Claus Von Bulow, OJ Simpson, Robert Blake, Phil Spector, the Menendez brothers and Michael Skakel trial for the Martha Moxley murder. Dominick Dunne devoted his life to battle against the legal system and has successfully overcome his own demons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154969</url></doc>
