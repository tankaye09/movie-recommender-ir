<plot>A young couple has one last hurdle before wedded bliss, meeting the parents. When Mark and Allison come to her parent's house for dinner, Mark does everything he can to prove himself. And when Allison's father finds out Mark is not of their faith, he has to show that love is more powerful religion. When a casual dinner is all but gone, and the wedding appears to be a shattered dream, Mark and Allison's father finally see eye-to-eye as he finally find their common ground.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092133</url></doc>
