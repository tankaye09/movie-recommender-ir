<plot>"Mind Over Matter" is the poignant story about a young filmmaker, Scott Gerow, who embarks on making a documentary about his father's struggle with obesity. In the process, Scott discovers he has brain cancer, unexpectedly shifting the story into a mutual father and son fight for their lives. One man has the choice to live--the other does not. While coming to grips with his own mortality, Scott continues to chronicle their respective battles with each of their illnesses, culminating in the filmmaker's graceful acceptance of his own valiant death. We are left behind feeling the beauty, courage, and dignity the filmmaker never stopped having for the world in which he lived. This film is a salient reminder of how delicate and precious life truly is and the human spirit's will to live or die.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370617</url></doc>
