<plot>Teenager Andy Tark has one goal in his life - to make himself a legend in his own time - or is it his own mind? As classmates years later remember his wild scams, peculiar accomplishments, and odd ways, they speculate on their one common great mystery: What Ever Happened to Andy Tark? We explore the question with them, reliving Andy's high school adventures, from winning the Rubik's cube competition and selling the solution to his classmates, to charging a fee to those same classmates to earn the lowest grade in class and improve the grading curve for everyone else. From girlfriends to teachers to every kid he meets, Andy's world seems like one big scam. Will Andy become a legend? Only time will tell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651576</url></doc>
