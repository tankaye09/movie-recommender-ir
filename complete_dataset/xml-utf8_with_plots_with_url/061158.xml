<plot>It's February 2, 1461 and Edward Mortimer (soon to be King Edward the Fourth) led his Yorkist forces to victory over the invading Lancastrian army just weeks after his father and brother had been executed. The battle took place on the rolling hills of Herefordshire, where Edward's forces faced a much larger army, but prevailed in the end, paving the way for Edward's coronation as King. It is arguably the most famous battle of the War of the Roses</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061158</url></doc>
