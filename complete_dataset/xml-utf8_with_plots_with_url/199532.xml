<plot>Ernie has a vivid imagination and often talks to himself. Shy &amp; introverted, he has been on a lifelong quest to fulfill his mothers dying wishes; to find the perfect wife - as determined by her toes. Connie is in the Hospice program and has months left to live. Having survived an abusive husband, having made peace with what her life has been, she has no one left in her life other than Patti, her Hospice volunteer and friend. Patti decides to introduce Ernie to Connie in the hope that both will find joy and happiness in each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199532</url></doc>
