<plot>Here is a film that will enthuse any audience. Satan seems to be in a particularly good humor, and the antics he performs produce wonderful changes. The subject on which he performs his black art is a female weighing over 300 pounds. By merely passing his hand over her, he changes her head into that of a Donkey, from that to a Lion, then to a Pig, from that to a Frog, then to a Bear, and finally restores her to her natural self. As if by magic a child appears on the scene, and a cake walk takes place between the 300 pound beauty and the little tot of about 40 pounds. A large globe is seen in the background, to which Satan gives his final attention. Passing his hands over it, the glob parts, and an imp jumps out. After performing a number of acrobatic feats, he disappears, no one knows where, and Satan causes the globe to produce another one of his imps, who, with his master, finally disappears from view. The film is decidedly good and full of action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553091</url></doc>
