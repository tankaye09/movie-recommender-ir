<plot>A young Englishman, Paul, after an intensely intimate encounter in London with a beautiful but mysterious Hong Kong business woman, decides to chase a whim and follow his heart to the other side of the world to pursue his love further. Armed with nothing more than a lipstick-marked business card and very little money, Paul arrives in Hong Kong, ready to trek across the former British colony where East meets West in search of the truth- of what really happened between him and his love that night, and of what the future will hold for them both. Throughout his ordeals, Paul must bear a terrible secret. But the gripping final showdown between Paul and his lover reveals Paul isn't the only one with a deep, dark secret.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?296277</url></doc>
