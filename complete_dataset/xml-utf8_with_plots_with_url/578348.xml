<plot>The Naked City is a fictional mid-1930's story about Archer; a disillusioned male protagonist who struggles with his own self worth after his wife leaves him. As an ex-Detective, he is forced to take on petty private eye assignments. He investigates an 'artist' who photographs the crude aftermath of violent crimes, and exploits them by exhibiting this collection at a high society art gallery. Archer is forced to enter the gaudy world he despises and in the process, comes face to face with the source of his aggression.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578348</url></doc>
