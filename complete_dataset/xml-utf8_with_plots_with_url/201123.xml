<plot>Fortune Files examines what happens to a celebrity's money after they die. This special opens a window into the extraordinary lives and even more extraordinary deaths of two icons - Tupac Shakur and Jerry Garcia - and investigates the issues that inevitably arise when a celebrity's estate is at stake. The show reveals amazing facts, among them: Garcia's will is the subject of more than $38 million in claims from business partners, former lovers and even one man who claims he saved Jerry from a bad acid trip. Shakur died at 25 with almost no assets, the result of a handwritten contract with Death Row Records that he signed in prison in exchange for an early release, but his estate has since grown to almost $150 million. Fortune Files will demonstrate that when it comes to celebrity and money, the end is just the beginning. Featuring brand new interviews with Afeni Shakur, Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, Jasmine Guy and Mountain Girl, Jerry Garcia's first wife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201123</url></doc>
