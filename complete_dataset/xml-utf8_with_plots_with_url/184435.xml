<plot>The film Everyday life's changing moods is a kind of search for personal maps of our hidden thoughts during the process of creation. Just like in a diary moments in everyday life are revealed in this film as a site of desires and fears, but in its essence it explores ideas which are constructing (or deconstructing) any work of art. Everyday life's changing moods is made out of intertwined visual and textual elements. However, the subconscious treatment of text in contrast to the conscious use of visual narrative forces the elements to oppose each other. The text becomes a gesture and visual images turn to contents. Both words and pictures are leading to disruption of a fine line between public and private making the clear reading of present reality unable. The film examines the interconnections between me and others; gender and identity illustrated as our connection to the external world as we search for the internal. Through simulated reality, simulated personal point of view, false surrealism, through words and sentences which strive to reconstruct tacitly the visual, the main issues of this film are: simulations of ability to be aware of feelings and imaginations through processes of creation. The intimacy of the artist is brought to be public - this procedure reveals itself as primarily artistic method in producing any work of art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184435</url></doc>
