<plot>Although Eichmann was responsible for implementing the "Final Solution" which led to the deaths of over 5 million Jews, 40 years after his execution, he still remains an enigma. How did this simple and unsuccessful salesman rise to power in the SS and Nazi regime? What motivated him? What inspired him? This film looks at Eichmann the man, parallel to Eichmann the Nazi who invented the "Eichmann System". The "Eichmann System", which was based on lies and deceit, led millions to their extermination in his gas chambers. For the first time, Eichmann's story is portrayed through his own eyes. He reveals how the system operated and how he felt implementing it. EICHMANN - THE SECRET MEMOIRS is not just an in - depth profile of one man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023790</url></doc>
