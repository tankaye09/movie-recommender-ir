<plot>Hunter Leroux is seventeen, angry and going nowhere when he and his buddies decide to hop a freight train out of the depressed New England factory town of Barren Falls, Massachusetts. Their goal: To escape their troubles and the small-town hopelessness, and live like the outlaws of the Old West, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor - themselves. As they slowly journey westward, Hunter becomes increasingly haunted by his past and begins to wonder if what they're doing is going to be worth much of anything in the end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035085</url></doc>
