<plot>A wealthy teenager who suddenly loses her money will go to any lengths to get it back in this made-for-cable thriller. Kristen and Jason are a pair of seniors at an exclusive private high school; they run with a crowd of rich kids more interested in judging others by their wealth or social status than their qualities as people. Kristen has been accepted into Harvard, but learns that her plans may have to change when the business owned by her father (in tandem with Jason's family) suddenly goes belly-up after years of success, leaving both of their families flat broke. Trying not to think about her problems, Kristen goes away for the weekend with Jason and a group of their friends. One of the guests, Richard, is a scholarship student who comes from a economically disadvantaged family and doesn't fit in with many of the other kids. Over the course of the weekend, Richard discovers that a lottery ticket he bought earlier in the week is a winner, and he's now worth several million dollars. Kristen, still smarting from the loss of her family fortune, is determined to get her hands on the ticket before Richard can redeem it. When attempting to seduce Richard fails to get the ticket away from him, she persuades Jason to help her in a scheme to kill Richard during a hiking trip, and then take the winning ticket.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108084</url></doc>
