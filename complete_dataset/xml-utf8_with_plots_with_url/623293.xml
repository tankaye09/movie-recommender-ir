<plot>Nyurgoon tends to have bad luck. He is ridden with debt, and no cash on hand. His wife is expecting their fourth child. Nyurgoon gets in the car with his 9-year old son (who has already learned never to trust his dad) and drives around Yakutsk to try and find a solution to his money and familial problems. The film takes place in the autonomous Yakut (Sakha) Republic of Siberia, and was filmed in the local Yakut language.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623293</url></doc>
