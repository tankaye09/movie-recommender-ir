<plot>Horatio Hellpop has been chosen to be the conscience of his race: haunted by dreams of mass murderers, as Nexus he is forced to seek the killers out and assassinate them. His superpowers, granted by an ancient alien and derived from the stars, are almost limitless, but they are his only because he dreams and then kills. And, while the men and women he destroys are guilty of crimes against humanity, sometimes the effects of their deaths can threaten a world -- or Nexus' fragile peace of mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394776</url></doc>
