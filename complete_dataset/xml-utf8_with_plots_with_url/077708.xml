<plot>T.J. and his older yet very flexible buxom girlfriend Laura invite his friend Mark and her friend Cassie for a tennis match. But since Mark's parents don't like him dating an older woman, parental disapproval is the biggest obstacle facing Cassie and Mark. Although they are gloriously and deeply in love, Mark's parents are set on ending the romance. When Cassie discovers she has bone cancer, she decides leaving Mark is for the best. Elated, Mark's parents send him to Europe to study-and to forget Cassie. When Mark's parents find out the real reason Cassie let Mark go, they are ashamed of their interference. Mark is reunited with Cassie in an emotional moment that now has the blessing of his parents. Cassie and Mark now know that nothing can stop their love-it goes far beyond the limits of her illness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077708</url></doc>
