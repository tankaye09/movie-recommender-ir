<plot>Female Driven Psychological Thriller - "Wait Until Dark" meets "Body Heat" "Blind.Spot" is the classic, "Wait Until Dark" however the twist is like "Body Heat". It is the story of a blind woman a detective and a murderer. The murderer doesn't know that she is blind, so like "Wait Until Dark", he goes after her to kill her. However, as story line heightens, the audience realizes this is actually a black widow spinning her web around the detective who has fallen for her. The writer Tom Sullivan is one of the most famous men in America. He has climbed Mount Everest, he is in the top 1% of golfers in the nation, and oh yes, he is blind. A documentary has been done on him and he has written two books, "If You Could See What I Hear" (which was made into a movie) and "Adventures in Darkness".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074774</url></doc>
