<plot>A chronicle of the University of Maryland basketball program, beginning with Bud Millikan years and the opening of Cole Field House in the 1950's, through the Lefty Driesell years of the 1970's and the Len Bias tragedy of the 1980's, to the hiring of Gary Williams in 1989, replete with internal turmoil and suffocating NCAA sanctions. It all culminates in 2002, with the program winning its first-ever national championship, cementing it's elite status.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615340</url></doc>
