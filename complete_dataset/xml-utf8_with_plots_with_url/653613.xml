<plot>On December 25, 2004, Anantaya 'Nui' Krittapak was a normal Thai citizen living in a small town on the Andaman coast, looking after her young son and cooking noodles for tourists at her beach side restaurant. But the next morning, a giant wave would change her life forever. Her business destroyed, neighbors and friends killed, Nui persevered, motivated by a desire to help rebuild the broken lives that resulted from a disaster that left no one untouched. As relief efforts came and went, Nui found a way to get involved when she saw her neighbors now facing serious and complex legal problems that were unlike anything they'd ever encountered. Working with a mobile team of paralegal volunteers, Nui became a leader in her community, helping empower other villagers with something many never had access to before: the law. Witness some of the tragic accounts of the tsunami, and discover the legal issues that went under-reported and often over looked in the midst of the physical devastation. When The Wave Rolled Back is the inspiring story of Thai tsunami survivors and their incredible strength and resilience in the wake of one of the deadliest natural disasters in history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653613</url></doc>
