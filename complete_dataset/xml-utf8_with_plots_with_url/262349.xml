<plot>A grandfather is allowed to keep his grandchild on the condition that he have with him something that he has never thought to be necessary or even useful: a cell phone. To be even more specific, an Apple iPhone. The two generational bookends take on the task of studying the device. They painstakingly follow each word of the instructions made by the grandfather's son/grandchild's father. They attempt to record a voicemail answer message, they add contacts, and finally they attempt to make a call. In the end who will have better technological skills? The infant grandchild or the wise grandfather?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262349</url></doc>
