<plot>Living in Limbo is a thought-provoking documentary about the predicament of undocumented immigrant children in America and the controversial law that could change their lives. Every year 65 000 children of undocumented immigrants graduate from high school. They were raised in the United States from a young age as American citizens, yet they have no legal status in their own country and their future is uncertain. The DREAM Act is a proposed law that would help these children continue their education and follow a legal path to US citizenship. Despite widespread support in Congress, the DREAM Act has never been brought to a vote and has been on hold for 4 years. As the DREAM Act was again pending in the 109th Congress, Living in Limbo provides a thoughtful look at the issues of this legislature and the lives that it would affect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339276</url></doc>
