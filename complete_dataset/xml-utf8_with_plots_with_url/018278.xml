<plot>Charles Bowers is once again an eccentric inventor. This time, he has only a matter of hours to debut his extraordinary new invention in order to collect a huge bequest from his deceased father. Along the way, his evil uncle tries to sabotage the machine, so the inheritance will go to him. The invention basically does everything, including, in one sequence of near unsurpassed beauty, creating a little doll and bringing it to life by sewing a tiny little heart into its chest. The doll comes alive, and the machine dresses and feeds it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018278</url></doc>
