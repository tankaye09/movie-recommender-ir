<plot>Bill is a previously homeless street vendor from Sydney, Australia. Bill takes us back in time to the warm Technicolor glow of the 1950s, when he was just a boy. At 14 he goes to live with his Mother, a glamorous woman who is unsure of what to make of this child who has come back into her life. Unfortunately, there is a 'fly in Bill's ointment', namely his next door neighbor George, who is always showing off with his nifty new cricket bat, and Bill feels threatened by this. When Bill decides to teach George a lesson, things get explosive in the literal sense but the boys' adventure leads them to a new friendship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401130</url></doc>
