<plot>In the mid-1970s, Alan Root brought the first hot-air balloon to Africa for filming purposes, recognizing that airplanes were too fast to film animals adequately, while the noise of the slower helicopters frightened them away. A visually-stunning and amusing film is Root's Balloon Safari, made with his wife Joan, they chronicle the arrival of the balloons, as well as the tribulations of learning to fly them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057789</url></doc>
