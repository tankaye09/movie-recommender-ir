<plot>In 1970, there was no internet, cell phone, VCR, DVD player, or cable television. All of these things factor into the equation of making it in Hollywood today. Rather than listen to movie giants talk about how they made it thirty years ago, or what it's like working with big movie stars, HOW TO MAKE IT IN HOLLYWOOD BEFORE YOU MAKE IT is portrait of 10 emerging artists on the frontlines of Hollywood, running the gamut from actors, writers, producers, dancers, singers and songwriters, all at different stages in their careers - Just about to break out, maybe they just broke out, and hopefully they will break out. Lisa Heile has sung background with countless stars, yet she herself is not a star; Ken Cosby has a famous name, yet he has no fame; and after nine years of options, David L. Watts had his spec script MY GREATEST MISTAKE turned into a major Hollywood release, but when the movie came out, he did not receive a screenplay credit. A star in Hollywood is exactly that - a star. But it's people like Lisa Heile, Ken Cosby and David L. Watts that make up the majority of the players in Hollywood. They are people who work, make some money, but aren't yet a household name. A Lisa Heile, Ken Cosby or David L. Watts today, is a Hollywood star tomorrow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248653</url></doc>
