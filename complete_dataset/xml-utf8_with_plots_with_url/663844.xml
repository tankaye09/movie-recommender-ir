<plot>Ryo and Atsushi, better know as the comedy duo London Boots, host this show in which friends are invited to talk behind each other's backs. In each show, a group of five young women (all friends) are asked a series of personal questions about each other like "who in your group is the ugliest?" and "who sleeps around the most?" At the end of the show, the one who has received the most votes gets to choose whether she will try for the grand prize by herself, or take her 'friends' with her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663844</url></doc>
