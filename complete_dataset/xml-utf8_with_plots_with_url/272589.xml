<plot>Chaudhary lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his wife and two sons, Suraj and Chander. His brother-in-law, Kataria, conspires against him, and after his demise, abducts both his sons so that his son can inherit the estate in its totality, leaving the two youngsters at the mercy of strangers, and perhaps, never to meet each other nor see their mother ever again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272589</url></doc>
