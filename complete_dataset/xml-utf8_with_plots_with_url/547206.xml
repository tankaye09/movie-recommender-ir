<plot>This is the powerful story of an era dominated by one remarkable man: the Emperor Napoleon, a man who has attracted more debate than almost any figure in history. Ruthless, despotic but an undoubted military genius, this informative film follows the Emperor from his early days, through the glorious victory at Austerlitz, to the disasters of the Russian campaign and final defeat at Waterloo. Superb filmed reconstructions and recreations. Period images and paintings. Informative graphics and maps, Interviews with Dr. David Chandler - the world's foremost Napoleonic authority. Expert commentary and analysis by Niall Barr of the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst and historian John Tincey.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547206</url></doc>
