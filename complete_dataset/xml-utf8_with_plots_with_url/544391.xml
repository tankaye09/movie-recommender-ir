<plot>The American friends David, Craig and Andrew travel on vacation in Bangkok, Thailand, to celebrate the last bachelor days of Andrew that is going to marry his fianc√©e Heather. They hire the gorgeous Thai photographer Sita to sightsee Bangkok with them. A couple of days later, Andrew tells them that they must return to Los Angeles and while going to the airport, they see Sita being dragged out from a river. Once in Los Angeles, the infection on the face of the yuppie David grows and while in a meeting, he vomits on the table and the other executives. Meanwhile Craig is stabbed by a stranger in an alley near his home and is interned in the hospital with a serious infection. When Andrew and Heather go to a Thai restaurant to have dinner, an old lady gives an amulet to David for the protection of Heather. When Heather is possessed by a fiend, David calls the shaman and the woman tells him that the trio of friends has been cursed by witchcraft and only a bridge ceremony may exorcise the evil spirit. But Andrew must tell first the truth about the tragic trip to Thailand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544391</url></doc>
