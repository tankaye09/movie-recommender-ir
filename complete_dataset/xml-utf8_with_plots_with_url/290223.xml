<plot>Zouzou comes from a family of entertainers who live in the Mohammed Ali Street sector of Cairo, Egypt. By day, she is a college student, by night she performs at weddings and other private parties with her family as a dancer and singer. Zouzou falls in love with handsome Said, one of her professors, who breaks his engagement to his cousin in order to be with her. The angry, jealous cousin does some snooping, and discovers Zouzou's shameful secret, that she comes from a family of entertainers. (In Egypt, entertainers are the very lowest class in society, and female dancers are the lowest of the low.) The evil cousin schemes for Zouzou's family to entertain at a huge party where Said and Zouzou will be present as a couple. As the family enters, both Zouzou and her mother Naima are horrified to realize they've been set up and Zouzou's secret publicly exposed. Zouzou must then deal with the fallout in her relationship with Said.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290223</url></doc>
