<plot>Three best friends embark on new relationships in the same week with varying results. One sees a woman that he is extremely attracted to in a peep show and then runs into her on the street and finds her more intelligent than her job might lead one to expect. A second meets a woman at his uncle's funeral and starts a wild affair, which involves public sex, not knowing that she is married. The third, who struggles with relationships, de-flowers an over-weight woman at her request before she enters a convent. Then he gets a break with the waitress he had been pursuing, only to find it all fall apart when she learns of his night with the other woman. All of the central figures are deceitful in some measure and are struggling to find truthful relationships.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600443</url></doc>
