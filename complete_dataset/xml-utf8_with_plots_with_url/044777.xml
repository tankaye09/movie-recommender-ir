<plot>See how the designs of buildings of the late 1920's through the 1930's were influenced by the emergence of the automobile era and see how some of these designs stand today. We will look at the famous Sunset Tower Hotel, the immaculate Wilshire Bullock's Department Store, the magnificent Oviatt Building with it's garden rooftop Penthouse and more. Also see the special feature: Peg Entwistle, the sad true story of a young struggling actress who jumped to her death from the Hollywood sign in 1932.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044777</url></doc>
