<plot>A confident young man with a unique style and a solid entrepreneurial spirit has made it his mission to bring the small pleasures in life to a global market. As an aspiring inventor inspired by history's most infamous jokesters, he's determined to jump through all the hoops in order to realize his dreams. When he's not taken seriously amongst the locals stateside, he takes it upon himself to travel to Shanghai and broker a manufacturing deal on his own. Lost in Shanghai, Johnson discovers that it takes more than a bright idea to succeed. It takes guts, determination, and a fist full of sneezing powder.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350918</url></doc>
