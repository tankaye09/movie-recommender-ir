<plot>A fellow walks out of a bar, tipsy. He soon finds himself, through a string of events, in a dark alley with three thugs, who beat him senseless. He needs is to learn self defense. In a boxing ring, with a large opponent, he practices five lessons: "diplomacy," "make a plan," "God is on your side," "technology," and "preemptive self defense." Once he completes the course, he advances to "applying what you've learned." He returns to the street where he left the bar; mayhem ensues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327786</url></doc>
