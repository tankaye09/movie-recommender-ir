<plot>A very pretty and pleasing picture especially to the children. Four children have received a large number of toys consisting of tin soldiers and sailors. The children arrange their toys in a pretty group about their room, and retire to bed, dreaming of their new possessions. The toys mysteriously enlarge and come to life, the sailors dancing their typical hornpipe. Upon the children awakening and finding their toys to be animated, they join in the dance and other festivities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154655</url></doc>
