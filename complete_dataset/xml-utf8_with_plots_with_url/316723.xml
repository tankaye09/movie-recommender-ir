<plot>The preparations of two political parties, Vivant and Tarte for the elections. The Vivant-party is new (as is also Tarte) and their leader has to train the candidates and teach them how to explain the ideology of the basic-income during meetings. He is a multimillionaire and he directs his party in a authoritarian way and he is also funding the campaign. On the other hand, Tarte is a party that does not do anything to attract the sympathy of the public and they look more like clowns than serious politicians. Their leader, Noël Godin is the world-famous writer who threw a pie in the face of Bill Gates. They are against all authority and they proclaim complete freedom for everyone. The film is showing something of Belgian politics in a funny way but the lessons one can learn from it apply for all countries and raises the question if it is useful to start a new political party.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?316723</url></doc>
