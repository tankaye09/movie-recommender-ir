<plot>Accountant Leonard Dunbar's Monday appointment shows up right on time, 4:15 PM. She is Helen Desareé, who's dressed and looks fit to kill. She asks Dunbar to go through her recently-deceased mother's papers and arrange for the transfer of any and all assets to herself, the sole beneficiary. Helen returns on Wednesday at 4:15 PM for a progress report and again on Friday, same time, to sign whatever is necessary. During the week, Dunbar makes an extraordinary discovery about the death of Alice Desareé. What will he do with his knowledge?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542842</url></doc>
