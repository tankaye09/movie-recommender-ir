<plot>Edgar decides the 4th of July fireworks celebration in town is too much for his nerves, and he and his wife Sally and her brother will take a nice drive out into the countryside and have a nice, peaceful picnic. His first mistake is inviting the sons of his neighbor to go with them, and his second is picking an Army artillery firing range as the location of the picnic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015069</url></doc>
