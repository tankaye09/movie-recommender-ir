<plot>A nationalist allegory about an Indian king's resistance to Alexander the Great. Greek general Seleucus Nicator, her called Minander (C.S.D. Singh), is left in charge by Alexander. He is opposed by Ugrasen (Santhanam), the king of Udaygiri and the founder (321 B.C.) of the Maurya dynasty. Minander's daughter Helen (Rajalakshmi) falls in love with the king and eventually marries him after Minander has been defeated and returns to Greece. The real heroine is Kumudini, as a fiercely loyal nationalist character, who throws out her husband Jayapala (Santhanam again, in a dual role) when she learns that he is a Greek spy. Her brother is Prathapan (Chinnappa).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360986</url></doc>
