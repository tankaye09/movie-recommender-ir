<plot>"If This is the Will of God...Who Needs God?" is a short documentary about censorship in the school environment. Aditi Gupta was a senior in high school when she created a piece of artwork depicting religious violence. Although the art was well received by teachers, its text, which read "If This is the Will of God...Who Needs God?" offended a tenth grade student, causing the assistant principal of the time to take down the artwork. The ensuing controversy, protests, and its aftermath are discussed in the film. This film contains interviews with the censored student, the head of the art department, the school principal, the advisor of the school newspaper, and a student protester. The documentary also includes pictures from the protests, as well as the original artwork.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256667</url></doc>
