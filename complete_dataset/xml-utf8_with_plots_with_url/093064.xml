<plot>A very interesting subject and a fine piece of photography. It shows two young athletes engaged in a canoe fight, one of the national sports of Canada. The picture was taken at Lachine Falls, Lachine River, Canada. Each of the contestants are standing in a canoe, and armed with two long poles, on the end of which is a pad. They fight each other vigorously with these poles, the object being to capsize the other's canoe and throw his adversary in the water.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093064</url></doc>
