<plot>A romantic comedy about a single man seeking a married woman and a single woman seeking a married man. Somehow, someway, the two are matched up. Needless to say that neither are ready for a commitment. Come on, we all know that Married people are already in that magical relationship, so they don't need another one. Right? Keep your sunglasses near, being discreet is a must! Don't ask, don't tell is the law of this land, at least until one of the secret lovers slips up and falls in love. BUMMER! This match made in the Lost In Love section of Misguided Souls Newspaper is only another crazy tale from the mind of Khari Ajene. It's only a movie, I promise!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?359038</url></doc>
