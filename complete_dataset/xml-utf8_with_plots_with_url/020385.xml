<plot>Prashant lives a middle-classed lifestyle along with his dad, who runs a small retail outlet, his mom, and a sister, Geeta. Prashant is concerned about gangsters, led by DK, who openly and forcibly extort money from everyone. When a poor shopkeeper, Raghu, is assaulted, Prashant's friend, Shankar, accompanies him to file a police complaint with Inspector Nagpal. Shortly thereafter Shankar gets killed. As there is no one to look after Prashant's sister, Suman, Prashant takes her home with him, but ends up getting up married to her. Both settle into an idyllic lifestyle, and give birth to a son, Raju. Their harmonious lifestyle will soon be shattered when Geeta will be sexually molested and killed; Prashant's father will be arrested for killing Inspector Nagpal, while Prashant himself will end up killing DK and be on the verge of turning into an extortionist himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020385</url></doc>
