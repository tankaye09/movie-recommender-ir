<plot>Angry Kid stands outdoors, near a fish and chips shop, eating his chips from a sheet of newspaper. He tosses one into the air and catches it in his mouth. But, he's drawn the attention of a neighborhood dog, who leaps high enough to catch a chip or two in mid air before Angry Kid cottons on to what's happening. "These are my chippies, not for doggies," exclaims the Kid. Then he makes a big mistake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103888</url></doc>
