<plot>A most excellent bathing scene secured at Kiel on the coast of Germany. A large number of bathers are indulging in the sport of trying to withstand the force of the heavy surf. They are in many cases knocked about like nine pins, which, together with the beautiful spray and surf effects, makes this picture very valuable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060856</url></doc>
