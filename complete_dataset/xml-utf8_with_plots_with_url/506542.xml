<plot>In July, 2005, filmmaker Jon Ezrine flew from Los Angeles to Miami Beach to shoot a documentary about his mother, an extremely charismatic yet misguided narcissist. What transpired is a very strange, sometimes hilarious, and often disturbing portrait of mother and son. Also featured are the director's brother, an unemployed golfer obsessed with happy hours and tee times; his sister whose strained relationship with her mother stems from the fact that she married a German; and the father, a detached attorney living in Manhattan who's been divorced from the mother for over thirty years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506542</url></doc>
