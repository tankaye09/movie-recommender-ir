<plot>Barkitecture gets families barking up the right tree! Each episode is the rags to riches story of a wayward dog finding a permanent home, and the family who welcomes the new pet into their lives. Hosts Dr. Karen Tobias and Kenny Alfonso walk the family through the adoption process and help them prepare for the dog's homecoming. Dr. Karen uses her experience as a veterinarian to give the family tips on how to care for their new friend and teaches them how to pick out the best supplies. Kenny designs and builds a stylish, custom doghouse that's safe and functional.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059865</url></doc>
