<plot>On her husband's demise, attractive Bridget suddenly finds she can't meet the financial demand of her Sussex country house in Brighton without his income. Her solution: take in lodgers. Two other "belles" soon take up her offer. One is Annie, a rather thick-skulled but likeable and friendly farmer's daughter from a small English village who is also a widow who had to sell her house for money. The other is Frances, a sardonic and sarcastic ex-headmistress who has divorced a pig named Michael who took the house when they seperated. Also, Bridget shows her seductive side and she searches for a new mate. Later on, Frances' tactless and over-protective mother, Josephine, moves in as well to hover over and generally annoy her daughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083142</url></doc>
