<plot>Vijay Saxena lives a middle-class lifestyle along with his college-going sister, Sweety, in a small town in India. He gets a job as a Professor at the City College, where he meets with Sweety's friend, Sudha Verma, and both fall in love with each other. When a student, Adhikari, attempts to molest Sudha, Vijay comes to her rescue, only to subsequently apologize to Adhikari when Sudha retracts her testimony and ends up blaming Vijay for molesting her. Later Vijay finds out that Adhikari and some goons had threatened to harm Sudha's younger sister, and the duo resume their romance. With the help of Inspector Arjun Singh, Vijay is able to get Kalicharan, the son of gangster don, Natwarlal, arrested and held in a cell much to the chagrin of Natwarlal. Arjun gets killed, Sweety witnesses his death, and takes Inspector Arvind Phadke to the murder scene, but Arjun's body is missing. Subsequently Sweety is molested and killed. Inspector Arvind Phadke arrests Vijay for molesting his sister. Watch what happens during the trial amidst Vijay's pleas that he is not guilty of this heinous crime.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431401</url></doc>
