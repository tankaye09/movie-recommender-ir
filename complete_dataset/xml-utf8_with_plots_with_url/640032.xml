<plot>Classic celebration of Mithila's King Shiva Singha's (Kapoor) love for his wife while chronicling the influence of the pacifist court poet Vidyapati (Sanyal). Invited to the royal court by the king, Vidyapati arrives with his faithful follower Anuradha (Kanan Devi). Queen Laxmi (Chhaya Devi) falls in love with the poet, much to the distress of the king. The king falls ill and starts neglecting his royal duties until Anuradha persuades him that true love does not need reciprocation. The queen, equally distressed by by her divided loyalties, contemplates suicide, encouraged by the prime minister who is worried by the nefarious impact of Vidyapati's poetry on the king.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640032</url></doc>
