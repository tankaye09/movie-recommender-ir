<plot>The basic idea of the film: This world has not been tailor-made for us. We are not "at home". We live in a world, which is according to Jacques Monod "an alien world", a world which is "deaf to our music, just as indifferent to our hopes as it is to our suffering or our crimes". Within this alien world, in this vast and cold and dark universe, we have built, and keep building day by day, our own human world of dignity, freedom, security and happiness. Deliberately or unintentionally, in or without awareness, we construct (and demolish) this world every moment, including the most trivial acts of our lives. How? That is what the series will show. First episode: Are we at home in this Universe? Is our Planet an Earthly Paradise? Or a killing field? Why do certain animals die so early? Will butterflies, cockroaches and dolphins survive us? How did we convince ourselves that we were at the center of the world? Homo sapiens and the human adventure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?053353</url></doc>
