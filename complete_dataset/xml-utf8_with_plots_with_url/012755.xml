<plot>Andy is left alone to mind the clothing store while his wife goes to the Amazon Hotel for Women to practice rolling bandages for the Red Cross. A woman comes in to buy a pair of shoes and tells Andy she wants the pair on the mannequin on the sidewalk. Andy mistakes a lounging (wasn't she always) Barbara Pepper for a mannequin and takes a shoe off of her foot. This does not go unnoted by her highly jealous boyfriend Vernon Dent, who pokes Andy in the jaw. A couple of more incidents with the blonde gets Andy more trouble. He goes to the Amazon Hotel for Women to get his wife and can't get past the Amazon House Dick, and disguises himself as a woman. That he eventually ends up in the Blonde's room, shortly ahead of the arrival of his wife, the jealous boyfriend and the very-mannish House Detective should come as no surprise to anyone... other than Andy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012755</url></doc>
