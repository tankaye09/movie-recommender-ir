<plot>A beautiful but penniless Cuban girl (Calypso) kidnaps herself a seemingly wealthy and apparently married American gringo (Ulysses) in modern-day Havana, Cuba. Calypso spends her victim's money, sells his passport, loses him his job, and drives him across Cuba locked in the trunk of a 1958 Cadillac Eldorado convertible. However, Ulysses comes to think of his captivity as a liberation, and his captor as his love... Cuba Libre is a re-telling of Homer's Odyssey on modern-day Cuba, featuring parrots, handcuffs, rum, baseball, Santeria, socialism and hurricanes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?120587</url></doc>
