<plot>Just outside the city of New Orleans in Jefferson Parish, officials have created a Mardi Gras event for the entire family. Family Gras is a weekend filled with live music, parades, cultural events and activities for everyone. Situated in the heart of the parade route are two stages with live musical acts, an art market, food vendors and a gaming area for kids. A celebrity host and a street reporter team up to give you a sense of what it is like to experience Mardi Gras, family style. The special includes exciting concert footage and extensive coverage of electrifying parades featuring extravagant floats and lavish costumes. Horizon shows people around the world that there is more to Mardi Gras than Bourbon Street.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188801</url></doc>
