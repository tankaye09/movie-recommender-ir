<plot>With the support of his wife Angela, Michale Taylor resigns from his job in search of a new and more satisfying chapter to both his career and life. The path ahead of him however, is less assured. As weeks turn to months and Michael's search goes unfulfilled, other issues - rising doubt and insecurity - become prominent. As his perception of all things clouds over, Michael finds himself in uncharted waters both within himself and his marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135285</url></doc>
