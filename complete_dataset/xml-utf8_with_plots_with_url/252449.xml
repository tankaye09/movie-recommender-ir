<plot>Children with Tourette's Syndrome, ages 8 to about 14, candidly describe what it's like to have Tourette's, a poorly understood neurological disorder. They show what their tics are like, talk about difficulties with school, social isolation, embarrassment, and feeling misunderstood and even unwanted due to the inherited condition they have no control over. The DVD has extras that explain Tourette's Syndrome, both from the viewpoint of the children and that of experts, as well as where to get more information about Tourette's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252449</url></doc>
