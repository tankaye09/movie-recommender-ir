<plot>Follow the hilarious misadventures of Brian O'Brian, a clever, problem solving, good Samaritan who somehow manages to turn everyday tasks into major comedy mishaps. Watch and laugh as Brian physically gets himself into, then miraculously out of, seemingly impossible situations that go unnoticed by the world around him. Each short episode is silent yet full of cleverly designed music and sound effects that perfectly complement Brian's brilliant physical comedic timing. This show is laugh-out-loud funny!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082751</url></doc>
