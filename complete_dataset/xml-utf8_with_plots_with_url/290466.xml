<plot>Chai, a forestry official, tells a campfire tale about his first days on the job and why he believes the forest is protected by an elephant's spirit. It's a story about his hot-headed first boss, Kamron, who wages a battle against illegal logging conducted by powerful business interests and the corrupt police. Caught between the two forces is the title character, named Boonsong, and his devoted jumbo beast of burden.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290466</url></doc>
