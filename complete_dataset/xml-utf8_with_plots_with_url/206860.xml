<plot>We are the first to show this picture in the United States. The picture was procured at an enormous expense, as it is almost next to impossible to obtain a picture of this kind in Germany, owing to the stringent police regulations. But we succeeded in getting an excellent film of that imposing pageant and are pleased to offer it to our patrons. The cortege is seen descending a hill, both sides of which are lined with soldiers. After the carriage passes on which rests the body of the late queen the soldiers fall in and follow it to the grave. Very imposing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206860</url></doc>
