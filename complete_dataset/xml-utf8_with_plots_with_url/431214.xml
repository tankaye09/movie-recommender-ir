<plot>True story of MC Breeze, aka Joey B. Ellis, who overcame childhood adversity to form his own record label in 1986. His single, "Discombobulatorbubulator," was the first rap record to be banned from radio. As a recording artist for MC Hammer he composed and performed the Theme Song for Rocky V (Go For It). After Hammer's legendary bankruptcy, he returned home to Philadelphia only to suffer dual tragedies that only his love for music could help heal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431214</url></doc>
