<plot>Alone on "Executioner's Row," Ned Blessing is a haggard, old cowboy and former sheriff. With nothing more than reflections on a life that's been filled with danger and excitement, he marks his time waiting and hoping that the man responsible for his imprisonment makes an appearance before the hangman does. With only a few days left to live, Blessing recounts his unbelievable life story. We meet Ned as a young boy heading west with his father, Anthony. We see the brutal shooting of Ned's father by the notorious Bruto Half-Tongue and Ned's enslavement by the Commancheros, a dangerous band of Mexican outlaws. While in Mexico, Ned meets Crescencio, a healer and visionary who will watch out for Ned the rest of his life. We also meet the beautiful Jilly Blue, the love of Ned's life, and the ruthless Tors Buckner, Ned's worst enemy. With just days between Ned and the noose, Ned has nothing to gain and no time to lose. But as we witness how these characters helped to weave Ned's life together in this action adventure Western, Ned's about to set his record straight...if the hangman doesn't get there first.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392112</url></doc>
