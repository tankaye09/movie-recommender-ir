<plot>A very pretty film which we class among the dances, although more strictly speaking it belongs to the order of Pantomime Tableaux. It shows seven beautiful children surrounding a giant lily with fancy dancing. The lily suddenly unfolds, revealing a beautiful child in the midst of a most gorgeous transformation scene, which takes the spectators back to the Christmas pantomimes which they have seen in their younger days. A complete entertainment in itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071820</url></doc>
