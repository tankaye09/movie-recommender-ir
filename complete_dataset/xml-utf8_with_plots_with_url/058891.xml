<plot>Two stories unfold simultaneously with Lea at the center of both. One story takes place in Lefkosia, Cyprus, the other in Montevideo, Uruguay. Lea's disappeared brother is the catalyst for both: while in Lefkosia a group of DNA scientists is trying to reveal the identities of persons missing, in Montevideo, Lea sees her brother in a photograph together with an older tango singer. Are the two stories a game of parallel times? Does one of them belong to a different dimension? Or is Lea's character stolen from a J.L.Borges novel where his heroes are able to make more than one choice. The answer is securely hidden until the end of the film since between the two cities, the two stories there is...a BAR.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058891</url></doc>
