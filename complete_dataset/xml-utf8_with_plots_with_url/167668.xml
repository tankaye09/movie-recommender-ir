<plot>Thodorakis, the film's hero, has a happy go-lucky attitude about life and women, but this all changes when he is forced by his uncle to train as a chef. He soon becomes a top chef and is so impressive that he enters a 'secret society' for chefs, who battle it out to see which one is the best. To his detriment he becomes so obsessive that the women in his life find him obnoxious and nothing seems likely to save him until the news of his patron's death slaps him in the face like a cold fish. In the end, the shock reminds him to keep his life in perspective.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?167668</url></doc>
