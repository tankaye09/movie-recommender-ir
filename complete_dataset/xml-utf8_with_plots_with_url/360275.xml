<plot>Priya lives a middle-class lifestyle with her parents in an apartment complex near Vishshakapatnam in Southern India. This is a city that is paralyzed with fear by the local crippled gangster, Satya, and his dreaded son, Shatru, who are known to kill anyone who dares to stand in their way. Then a new resident named Ganesh moves in to the complex and Priya falls in love with him. Shatru receives a threatening phone call from a man who calls himself Mass - who swears to humiliate, frighten, and then kill him - all within 30 days. Shatru scoffs at this, but gets concerned when his vehicle is blown up, and several of his goons end up dead. He confers with Satya, and together they decide to entrap Mass. While returning home, Priya watches Satya's goons taking Haftas from local businesses, and it is then she sees Ganesh, who is attempting to stop them. Priya does not know that she is headed for heartbreak for Ganesh has fallen in love with Satya's daughter, Anjali, who is not permitted to see Ganesh at any and all costs. When Shatru finds out Mass is Ganesh - he abducts Priya and another girl and holds them hostage and will only free them once he has Mass in his custody - so that he can first torture and then kill him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360275</url></doc>
