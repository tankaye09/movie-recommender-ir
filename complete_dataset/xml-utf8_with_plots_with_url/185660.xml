<plot>Experimentum Mundi is a poetic film about a unique musical performance and its composer Giorgio Battistelli. Inspired by everyday sounds of craftsmen from his hometown Albano Laziale, Battistelli created a score that has been performed successfully around the world for 18 years now. What makes it so unique, is the fact that except for the percussionist, all "musicians" are musical laymen. They are exactly the same craftsmen whose work forms the basis of the composition.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185660</url></doc>
