<plot>Taken at the Mid-Lent Carnival at Nice, France, 1903. This picture was taken in front of the judges' stand and brings into view "The Square" which was the centre of festivities. The panoramic device is set in motion, and swinging from left to right, shows the great crowds of people dancing and throwing their confetti in every direction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061142</url></doc>
