<plot>Documentary about pioneering British advertising executive and self-proclaimed genius, David Ogilvy, who led a revolution in advertising, feeding dreams and shaping aspirations with famous campaigns, slogans and jingles. He started what eventually would become conglomerate Ogilvy and Mather in 1948 and the film reveals the extremes and eccentricities of the man through interviews with those who knew him and worked with him, including his widow and son and authors Peter Mayle and Fay Weldon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130351</url></doc>
