<plot>"Devils Are Dreaming" is a bizarre black comedy about high art, pornography and a thirty-year-old loser caught in between. Beginning in the world of experimental theatre, careening into the world of pornography and landing side-ways in suburbia, the film combines striking visuals, raw performances, a disjointed timeline, and layered musical atmospherics to tell the story of a wannabe trying to find himself through various doomed artistic pursuits. Joseph Avedon (Stephen Donovan) is an annoyingly unfocused thirty-year-old living at home with his worried parents. While taking part in a ridiculously bad experimental theatre version of "Hamlet", he falls in love with the talented and beautiful Cessia (Jessma Evans). But Joseph soon finds himself kicked out of the production, rejected by the girl and being drawn in to a successful life as a pornographer. When confronted with failures in art and love, as well as the potential for success in a field he abhors, Joseph starts losing touch with reality - falling in to hallucinatory "spells", striving to make his life work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143673</url></doc>
