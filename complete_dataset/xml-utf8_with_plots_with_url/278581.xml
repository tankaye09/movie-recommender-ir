<plot>When a serial killer, tormented by horrendous apocalyptic visions, massacres several pregnant women in a small hypocritical Austrian border town at the end of the 19th century, a young slightly eccentric doctor from Scotland Yard is called to help solve this murder case, which shows striking similarities with the "Jack the Ripper" homicides in London a few months earlier. The killer's motive, however, seems to be rather different. Despite the fact that the young doctor has soon got the whole town against him, he sets out to hunt down the killer and to prevent further murders - not realizing for one moment that his actions will end up having shocking consequences for world history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278581</url></doc>
