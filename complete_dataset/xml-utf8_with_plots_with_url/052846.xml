<plot>This is the story of a school teacher, Mini. Her efforts to change the conventional pattern of education creates hurdles in her own career. Without being able to compromise, she is frequently transferred from one school to another. Her only solace is her childhood memory which surfaces time and again. Finally Mini does not reconcile with the present educational system. Resigns. Starts her own school where there are no four-walls and no regimentation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052846</url></doc>
