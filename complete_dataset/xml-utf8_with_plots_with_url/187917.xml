<plot>The Hare Krishnas. Known to many for their shaved heads, saffron robes and airport solicitation, the Krishnas were mainstays of the Flower Child generation. Faith and Fear: The Children of Krishna explores one of the darkest secrets From the mouths of children, born of, and raised by, Krishna converts, come tales of darkness and lessons of betrayal. And from the Krishnas themselves; a plea for compassion and a struggle to prevent their religion from being dismantled in North America. This documentary explores the history and of Hare Krishna, a Hindu denomination popularized in the 1960s and 70s and once endorsed by icons such as John Lennon and George Harrison. More than three decades later, dozens of young adults have come forward with chilling allegations of neglect, mistreatment and exploitation at the hands of their Krishna boarding school caretakers. If successful, their $400 million civil lawsuit could claim the majority of the Krishna's North American assets and effectively dismantle their religion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187917</url></doc>
