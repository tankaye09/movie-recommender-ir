<plot>Shows a garden wall in the background. Two lovers appear and lean over the garden gate where the moon throws a shadow upon the ground. The young man invites the young lady to a settee, when the moon's face brightens into a very pronounced grin. As the pair begin love making, the moon winks one eye and then the other, and, finally, as the lovers become more interested, the moon comes down from the sky with a grin on his face as large as an old-fashioned apple pie. When the couple discover the moon so close to them, the young lady faints in the arms of her escort. Highly amusing from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345328</url></doc>
