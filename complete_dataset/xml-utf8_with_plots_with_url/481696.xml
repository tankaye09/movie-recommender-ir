<plot>Peter goes home for the first time in many years after inheriting the unwanted house from his estranged uncle Ray. Once there, Peter finds Ray's caretaker, the eccentric young Lily, living in the old house. Ray's death leaves Lily alone and with no place to go. With Lily's subtle help, Peter is forced to face some of the harder truths about both his past and present situations. 'Scotch Hill' is a quiet character study of individuals at personal crossroads. The film is a simple, but potent slice of life addressing in subtle, poignant ways the complexities inherit in family relationships, aging and a person's sense of home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481696</url></doc>
