<plot>Musical Youth formed in 1979 at Duddeston Manor School, Birmingham, England. This pop/reggae influenced group, featured two sets of brothers, Kelvin and Michael Grant, plus Junior and Patrick Waite. Their massive 1982 hit "Pass The Dutchie" was the first of their songs to capture the public's imagination. It propelled their record to Number 1 in the UK singles chart, and went on to sell over four million copies. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award, and charted in the US Top 10. "Youth Of Today", "Never Gonna Give You Up", "007" and "Tell Me Why?" were also big international hits. This DVD features these incredible musicians live in concert!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382499</url></doc>
