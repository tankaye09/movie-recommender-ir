<plot>Keepintime started as a simple idea, bring some of the most revered and notable L.A. session drummers together for a photo shoot (Roy Porter, Earl Palmer, Paul Humphrey, and James Gadson), and having them talk about their famous and sampled recordings. However memory can be elusive so to remind these rhythm legends Babu and JRocc with the aid of their instruments (turntables) remind the elders of why we hold them so dearly. The session captured in this short builds bridges between generations, collapsing preconcieved ideas about how music works. Ultimately, Cut Chemist gets in on the action and the music is edited by DJ Shadow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?289047</url></doc>
