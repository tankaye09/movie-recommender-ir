<plot>Elijah, also known as MC Ellipsis, is an aspiring hip hop artist that feels connected to his past. The elements of his childhood start to play key roles in a recurring vision that affects the up and coming musician on another plane; a place that separates the norm from extraordinary. Elijah remembers fishing trips with his father deep in 'the boot' of Louisiana but is haunted by what waits for him at the end of the line. He talks about his microphone that was given to him by his older brother John. The relationship he shares with his microphone is much like Arthur with his sword Excalibur. Losing his mic would be like tragically reliving the losses of his belated brother and his remembered father just as they happened the first time. But most of all, losing his microphone would be like Elijah losing himself. Elijah explains his vision to a stoop full of confused yet interested friends. Figures in his life that he has grown to trust even if they cannot relate. A passing blunt burns away to a story about a frayed fishing line, a disconnected microphone chord, and a fatherless child becoming a man, a man from Emerald City.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176354</url></doc>
