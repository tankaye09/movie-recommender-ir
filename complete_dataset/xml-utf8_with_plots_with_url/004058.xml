<plot>Set in the future, a computer programmer named Zeebo has just finished creating the first versions of his digital personalities that will be used by the Home Systems Corporation to give computers, appliances, bank machines and other devices more human-like personalities. While developing the code for the personalities, Zeebo learns from his digital personal assistant Simone of an anti-computer terrorist group called the "Pink Bunny Brigade" and its leader "The King Bunny" who have threatened the lives of all engineers who will not immediately stop programming machines. The slightly deranged King Bunny warns of an age where the human race will be taken over by artificial intelligent machines in his "they keep going and going" manifesto. As Zeebo continues to test his newly developed digital personalities on his own appliances hurrying towards a launch deadline, he realizes some of the advanced features he has thrown into these digital beings are causing them to have "minds of their own." Organizing around a microwave with the personality of John F. Kennedy and an ornery toaster named David, the digital personalities begin to question their existence and creators. What will happen as the executives at Zeebo's company pressure him towards releasing the not fully tested digital personalities into the appliances and machines of the entire world? Will the Pink Bunny Brigade assassinate Zeebo before the launch in the name of humankind? Are JFK the microwave and the rest of the digital appliances plotting to take over the human race?...find out in 2010 A Kitchen Odyssey.</plot><plot>Set in the future, a computer programmer named Zeebo has just finished creating the first versions of his digital personalities that will be used by the Home Systems Corporation to give computers, appliances, bank machines and other devices more human-like personalities.
