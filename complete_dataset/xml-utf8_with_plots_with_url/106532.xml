<plot>CINEMA AZN is a weekly half-hour program broadcast on AZN Television, a Comcast cable network. CINEMA AZN is an entertaining and informative program on Asian and Asian American movies - the first of its kind on American television - and reaches 17 million subscribers around the United States and in all major markets. The program mixes popular entertainment and informed reporting and features some of Asia's biggest stars such as Tony Leung (2046), Stephen Chow (Kung Fu Hustle), Amitabh Bachchan, Zhang Ziyi (Hero, Memoirs of A Geisha) and Joan Chen (Saving Face); and major filmmakers such as Zhang Yimou, Im Kwon-Taek, Wong Kar-wai and Hayao Miyazaki. It is aimed at the mainstream US demographic audience and appeals particularly to audiences interested in Asian and Asian American entertainment, personalities and movies. Cinema AZN is produced by Woo Art International, a New York-based production company, in association with Asian CineVision, a non-profit media arts organization.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106532</url></doc>
