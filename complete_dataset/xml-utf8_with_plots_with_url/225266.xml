<plot>Vaudevillian Gus Visser (1894-1967) enters from our right, walking toward a white duck standing on an elaborate small table. Gus is comically dressed, with hair parted in the middle and slicked down, wearing a three-piece suit and extra-long shoes. He and the duck share a small treat Gus has taken from his pocket, then he picks up the duck, holding his legs in the right hand as he faces the audience and sings "Ma, He's Making Eyes At Me." At key moments of the song, the duck joins in with a squawk.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225266</url></doc>
