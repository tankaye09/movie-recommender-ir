<plot>Avid outdoorsman and trophy hunter, Cad, is escorted by the ever-faithful Irish tracking guide, Iris, and his trusty driver, Guther, who lead them through the searing desert on their equipment laden Jeep. Together they are called into action to track down a potentially elusive and stubborn prey. Using his keen sense of smell, Iris leads the band to a remote hill where Cad formulates a strategic plan to attack and capture his game. Once on scene, Iris becomes too frightened to go on and forces Cad to go the final yards alone. Cad enters the lair of the beast and after all weapons have been spent, resorts to hand to hand combat. Once victorious, Cad emerges from the creatures den with his trophy held high in hand. Reunited with Iris and Guther, the trio mounts their jeep and ride off to challenges unknown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222309</url></doc>
