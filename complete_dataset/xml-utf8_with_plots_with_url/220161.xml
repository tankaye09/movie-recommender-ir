<plot>Gearheardt wants to take over Mexico. Jack, working for the CIA running the Mexico City station, ought to know better. But Gearhardt's sexy assistant with the disdain for clothes is so darn cute and Gearhardt's insane resolve is just so darn convincing. But does the agency really want the Cubans to take over Mexico? Goodbye Mexico takes a riotous, clear-eyed look at how the right hand of our intelligence establishment often doesn't know what the left hand is doing. The result is laughter too loud to be covert and the haunting suspicion that truth may be stranger than fiction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220161</url></doc>
