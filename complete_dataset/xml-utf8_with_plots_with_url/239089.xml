<plot>High Velocity matches the power-endurance of cross-country skiing, and the chilling focus of rifle marksmanship, with the speed of an aerial "pursuit." From cool to calm, the story continues with a solitary winter trek into the "outerspaces," blazing a fresh single track, and crust-cruising through hardwood forests past frost-blasted trees, on route to the mountain summit. Then, rewind the clock to the year 1920 and press play to contrast vintage footage with today's pro-elite skiers as they play on the same trails separated only by time. Fast-forward to 2002 with a preview of extraordinary images of pre-Olympics World Cup racing performances at Soldier Hollow USA, using point-of-view and tracking cameras that allow the viewer to experience the action first hand. "On location, all the athletes, and all the action."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239089</url></doc>
