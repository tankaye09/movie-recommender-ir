<plot>Quite unlike the approaching scene [LEHIGH VALLEY EXPRESS "BLACK DIAMOND"] of this most popular train, the audience first sees the track and mountain in the background, when the train suddenly dashes into view, going at a rate of about seventy miles an hour. In this manner the train speeds down the track for more than half a mile, when it rounds a curve in the road, disappearing from view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457336</url></doc>
