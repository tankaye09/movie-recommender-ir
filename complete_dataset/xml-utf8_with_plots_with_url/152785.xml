<plot>Black South African Djadje wants to return to Cape Town for her father's funeral after 12 years of European exile. In Zimbabwe she interrupts her journey. 'I cannot go back so quickly.' The nearness of her homeland, the people, the light and her own history become confusingly present. Her thoughts and memories combine with the familiar smells of Africa, which overpower her and disturb her equilibrium. She has come home to Africa but is unsure about her return to South Africa. 'Djadje' is a film that straddles the line between reality and contemplation, a journey through the South of Africa and into the feelings of an expatriate, her inner conflicts and doubts that, in the end, prevent her from crossing the border into her homeland.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152785</url></doc>
