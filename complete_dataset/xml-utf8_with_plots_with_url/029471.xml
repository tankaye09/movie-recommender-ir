<plot>A meditation on age, aging and the false perceptions created by adoring filmmakers. Alfred Levitt was a truly extraordinary artist, radical, philosopher and adventurer, who died in 2000 at the ripe old age of 105. Having lived through three centuries, Levitt reminisces about some of his friends and colleagues, including Jack London, Marcel Duchamp and Emma Goldman! But was this cute old man really the sum of all these wonderful experiences, or, was there something deeper and darker, waiting to emerge - things that would sully the character of this great man?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?029471</url></doc>
