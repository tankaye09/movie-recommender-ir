<plot>Taken from the Brooklyn Bridge. Shows a tugboat with two large barges loaded with freight cars. As they approach, the camera is trained on them until they pass directly underneath, giving a very novel effect. After the boats pass out of view, the camera is raised until the new East River Bridge comes in view. Then the camera is moved to the west, showing a splendid view of the lower East Side.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036835</url></doc>
