<plot>Sarah is agitated. It's 3:30 in the afternoon and she's just listened to a phone message from the guy she's been dating for almost a month. She calls her two best friends over to listen to it, and listen they do, over and over, discussing, dissecting, and deconstructing the 11-word message. The friends balance each other - one is pessimistic, the other looks for a silver lining. Sarah listens, distills her feelings, and picks up the phone to call him. What will she say? What will she reveal?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530109</url></doc>
