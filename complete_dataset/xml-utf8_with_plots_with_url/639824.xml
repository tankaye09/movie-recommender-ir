<plot>Cameras panned over individual panels from stories selected from DC Comics while voiceover actors read the dialogue seen in the balloons. Comic books chosen for this treatment included "Adam Strange," (Gardner Fox), "Nutsy Squirrel" (Woody Gelman) and "Sugar and Spike" (Sheldon Mayer). After story recommendations by Larry Hama, hundreds of pages from DC's vaults were photostatted and then recolored with luminescent dyes. There was no animation and no alteration of the original B&amp;W panels. Complete stories were shown, panel by panel, and most came from back issues of "Sugar and Spike." Some "Adam Strange" and "Swamp Thing" stories had more extensive production work with the addition of sound effects and music. The live-action opening showed kids arriving at a store to buy comic books.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?639824</url></doc>
