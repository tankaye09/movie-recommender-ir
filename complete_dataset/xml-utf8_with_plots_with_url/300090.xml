<plot>The only daughter of a wealthy industrialist, Rohit Narang, is kidnapped with the kidnappers demanding a ransom of 20 lakh rupees. Rohit and his wife, Sunidhi, come up with the money to secure the release of their daughter, Shilpa, but she, along with a friend, Neha Bose, are both found dead. The Police assign this matter to controversial Inspector Aditya Solanki, whose investigations take him to Amar Mathur, the son of a college lecturer. Aditya obtains a warrant to search the Mathurs' flat, and that's where they find the ransom money. Amar is arrested and held in a cell, where he confesses everything to Aditiya, alleging that he was a friend of the deceased girls, and that they were beaten to death by two of his friends, Tony Brar, and Vikram Desai. The problem facing Aditya is Tony is the son of a wealthy owner of Brar Constructions, while Vikram is the son of the Home Minister Rajiv Desai. It remains to be seen if Amar will be made the scapegoat for this gruesome crime or will justice and truth really be seen in action in this case.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?300090</url></doc>
