<plot>We follow Barbara through her morning preparations, but she has bad habits; she doesn't wash her sweaters or her hair, her room is a mess, she doesn't have time for breakfast, and she's late for school! Then she falls apart at a party; maybe she should take some tips from the more well-kempt Helen. All this time, she is lambasted by a condescending narrator who makes you want to hit her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226737</url></doc>
