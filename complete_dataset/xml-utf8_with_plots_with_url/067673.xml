<plot>In 1930's Studio City, a little girl from the desert struggles to find a sense of belonging when forced to move in with grandparents she has never met. She soon discovers her estranged grandmother is hiding behind a wounded heart, and Marian's resemblance to her own lost daughter is almost too much to bear. Despite her grandmother's wishes, Marian cannot let go of her rural past, leading them through a journey of secrets and confrontations that ultimately transforms their relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067673</url></doc>
