<plot>John Grierson coined the word "documentary" and was a key figure in the history of the documentary film worldwide. His best-known accomplishments are starting the British documentary movement of the 1930's, and founding the National Film Board of Canada just before the war. He was the subject of the 1973 NFB release "Grierson". This ONF film is the French version of that earlier release, with the addition of French narration and voice-over. Most of the film is identical, however some francophone interview subjects are substituted for anglophone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375914</url></doc>
