<plot>After the tragic death of her dad, Dr. Rekha continues to live with her step-mother in Bombay, where she runs a Mental Institute. While traveling by train one night, they are accosted by a knife wielding escaped mental patient, Sunil, whose aggression is calmed by Rekha. She gets him admitted into her hospital where he is put under observation and treatment at the hands of Dr. Mathur and herself. He soon starts responding positively under their care, and is on his way to recovery. Once he saves Rekha from being molested in a parking lot, and this sparks romance between the two. All is set for the two to get engaged at a lavish party. It is at this party that Rekha will find out that Sunil is not who he claims to be, and subsequently Sunil will also find out that Rekha has a dark secret in her recent past - a secret for which she is being blackmailed by a man named Tiger - and a secret that may well expose her as a murderess!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040640</url></doc>
