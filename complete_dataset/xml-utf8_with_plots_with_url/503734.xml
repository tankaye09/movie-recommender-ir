<plot>SO MANY WOMEN, SO LITTLE HAIR: One moderately attractive man's quest for beauty. A film by and about Jon Rubin. SYNOPSIS: A "hilarious and fast-paced"(New York Sun) comic documentary film following Jon Rubin as he fearlessly attempts to pick up attractive women on the streets of New York City (not a "mockumentary" but a true documentary, profiling something Jon does in real life!). Jon calls these encounters "at-bats", and the film follows them via hidden cameras, mostly with Jon failing, but with some successes! After each "at-bat" the unsuspecting women are approached by the crew to sign release forms and are interviewed to get their assessment of Jon's approach. The film is a true human comedy, not only funny, but also provocative, raising issues of attraction, dating and the pursuit of love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503734</url></doc>
