<plot>In a 22nd century city wrought with corruption, where politics and organized crime combine to rule, a former cop becomes a vigilante in the quest to find those responsible for his father's untimely death. Gabriel Dietrich does the work that the police refuse to do - bringing those above the law to some semblance of justice. The years in the darkest reaches of the underworld have taken its toll, and Dietrich has lost himself and his purpose for being, now only feeling frustration, sorrow, and rage. After Dietrich sends one of the city's elite away for his crimes, his ex-partner informs him of a contract that the machine has put out for a mysterious woman. Her presence in the city threatens all those in the highest levels of power. Dietrich races to find her in the hope that what she knows may help him in the quest for his father's killer. But he's too late, and now Gabriel Dietrich must confront an old nemesis to save the woman and hopefully discover the truth. In the end the truth he discovers is something about himself - something he lost as the rage and the darkness consumed him and his true purpose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?149893</url></doc>
