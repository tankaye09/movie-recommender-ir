<plot>"The dominie is making the most of his opportunity with the young lady of his choice, when his wooing is interrupted by a small boy who dangles a spider in front of his nose. As the minister jumps up suddenly the bench upsets; and the girl, thinking this is done intentionally goes away in anger, much to the minister's chagrin."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576720</url></doc>
