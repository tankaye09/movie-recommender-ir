He gets disappointed when his mother doesn't come to pick him up on weekends. One day, he follows his mom to Izmir, where she is on tour. Selma gets angry at him for doing so. Ilker injures himself as he falls down while riding a horse. In the hospital, it turns out the boy has leukemia. Selma now leaves her job and spends all her time with his little son.
