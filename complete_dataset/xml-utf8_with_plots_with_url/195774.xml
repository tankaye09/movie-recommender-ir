<plot>"This film is doubly interesting owing to the fact that you see the gun that fired the first shot at the Manila rebels, again fired, but for the purpose of celebrating the anniversary of the defeat of the Spaniards. A beautiful film, full of smoke, effect and activity. This film must be seen to be appreciated."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195774</url></doc>
