<plot>Born with furious ambition and a weak heart, Owen Irving is a prodigious movie producer who must face his own mortality when a severe heart attack rips him from the life he loves. Owen is convinced by longtime friend and colleague Rex Milton to get as far from the pressures of life and work as possible. While recovering on North Carolina's Oak Island, Owen meets Jery Norman; a local girl with a dark past. Jery quickly develops an intense fascination with the outsider, determined to show him a life that 18 hour days will not allow. But just as Owen is settling in, Rex returns unexpectedly with vague news of a power play from within the studio. Before long, Owen is unable to tell enemy from friend and must choose between fighting to get back to a life that might kill him, or embracing one that would ask him to give up everything he has worked for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410648</url></doc>
