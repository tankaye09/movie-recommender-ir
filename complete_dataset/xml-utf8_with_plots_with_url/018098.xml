<plot>"The Wayfarer's Journey: Listening to Mahler is an exploration of the relationship between music and healing. It presents a parallel story between two icons from the world of music featuring the legendary composer, Gustav Mahler and the renowned conductor, Christoph Eschenbach. Although they lived during different eras separated by one hundred years, both men experienced tragic childhood, but were able to achieve healing and redemption through music. Additionally, other participants are featured including Academy award-winning actor, Richard Dreyfuss, (as the voice of Mahler), Dr. Richard O'Reilly, one of the leading pediatric oncologists from the Sloan Kettering Institute, Dr. Balfour Mount,a cancer survivor and founder of the Hospice movement in North America, as well as, the students from the Curtis School of Music. Together they affirm the healing power of music. Actress, Kathleen Chalfant as narrator.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018098</url></doc>
