<plot>Andrew Lam arrives home to find his wife brutally murdered. He spots a man slipping out the back door but cannot tear himself away from his wife's side to give chase. The police arrive and immediately consider Andrew a suspect. Before they can arrest him, Andrew runs. Bennett Rayne, an off-duty police officer driving home after a hard day's work, crosses paths with Andrew and is thrust into the chase. Bennett follows Andrew to an empty warehouse and is forced to proceed on foot. Inside, Bennett is faced with the difficult task of single-handedly arresting a desperate man who has no intention of going peacefully.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265228</url></doc>
