<plot>The film "Breaking Up The Signals" revolves around four phone conversations, interwoven yet separated from one another. The meshing of four different settings, four characters roughly described and highly stereotypical through their use of the telephone, supposes a dialogue between the actors as a visual paradigm, an unconditional cinematic reality. If these stories are truly connected to one another, it is only because of certain common aesthetic features, from art direction, props, colors, to wording, oral and wandering facial expressions. Also, the notion of break up shifts from the human facet of an idiomatic expression to the technological meltdown leading to one's misunderstanding. Incidentally, if there is a theme that firmly holds this film together, it has to be the themes of miscommunication and miscomprehension, themes that try to be echoed throughout four different sets of parameters, four different sets of discourses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082343</url></doc>
