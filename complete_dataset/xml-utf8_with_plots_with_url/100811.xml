<plot>The Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 is known as the most treacherous and grueling off road race in the world where danger lurks around every curve and over every horizon. In this close up look at a rookie off road racing team who are attempting this granddaddy of all races, we join three men who will come together to form a dysfunctional family that they call Team Horizon. Meet Jeff Lloyd once homeless teenager, self-made millionaire, race car driver, Milo Brown, ex-con, junkyard owner, team captain and Toby O'Mara, plumber, chief mechanic, co-driver. We go inside to experience the ups and downs and prove that Murphy's Law truly exists as they bumble through the days leading up to the race. At times they're hysterically funny while also dealing with moments that are heart warmingly sad. It is here we discover what it takes physically, mentally, and emotionally to follow the dream of one man trying to bring his family, friends and a team together to experience life in the moment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100811</url></doc>
