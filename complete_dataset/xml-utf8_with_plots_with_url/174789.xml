<plot>The period from 1924 to 1928 saw a stimulus to immigration of Lithuanians to Brazil. The initiative, however, was part of a government endeavor to make the Brazilian population more white in color. The result is seen today in the presence of some two thousand Lithuanians and their descendants. Eldorado - Lithuanians in Brasil includes scenes filmed in SÃ£o Paulo, Rio, and in Vilnius, in Lithuania, with statements by people who left their native land to try life in Brazil. The documentary also includes files never previously on view from the last century made by anonymous film makers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174789</url></doc>
