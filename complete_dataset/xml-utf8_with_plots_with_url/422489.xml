<plot>Paper Girl is the story of Peiyu, a child who was partially raised by her grandparents in a Paper-mill in the country. Her grandparents pay for her to live in a foreign city that is believed to be more advanced, allowing Peiyu to pursue a better future. The middle-aged couple that takes her in, prove to be abusive and immoral. Peiyu grows up hating everything about the city. It is a filthy, corrupt home to people who have turned savage in their poverty. She falls victim to the pollution throughout the city, while holding on to vague memories from her past that are slowly fading away. The one element within the city that keeps Peiyu's faith in humanity is a woman named Cricket, who lingers in the alley beneath her window, watching out for her. At the age of sixteen Peiyu applies the knowledge of self-defense she learned from her grandfather, saving herself from her foster father. This is a pivotal moment in the story, freeing her from the chains that bound her to the city.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422489</url></doc>
