<plot>On a day one a beautiful blonde shows up at Mr. Evans residence and demands to speak with him. She is rejected. But Evans has seen her kind before, a young beautiful Hollywood wannabe who will stop at nothing to become famous. Evans refuses to see her but Amber Grace won't take no for an answer. Day after day she knocks at his front door, hiding behind dark glasses and wig she introduces herself as a journalist. She gets rejected. That event send her to a frenzy. Evans finally relents. She is, after all, quite beautiful and seemingly vulnerable. What harm could there be? Evans invites her in and then takes her out on the town. A little game of cat and mouse and before Amber Grace knows it - she's putty in his hands. Again, she's not the first young starlet to knock on Evans' front door. It's only a matter of time before he will get to the bottom of who she is and what she wants. She is shrouded in mystery, but the pistol she points at Evans by the end of the night very clearly tells us what she's after. Revenge. Let the games begin.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370608</url></doc>
