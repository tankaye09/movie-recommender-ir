<plot>29-year-old lawyer Heinz Wiegand goes to the Eastern part of Germany on a business trip. When he comes upon a gang of Neonazis who have blocked up a road in order to keep their village free of unwanted strangers, he refuses to obey their commands. They thrash his car and beat him over the head. After Wiegand has died in hospital, his former colleague Werner Neuss acts as attorney for Wiegand's widow. In court he viciously attacks a man wrongfully accused - a hitchhiker who was in Wiegand's car at the time of the incident. The Nazis, in cooperation with the village population, have framed the poor guy, and Neuss buys their fake evidence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?656355</url></doc>
