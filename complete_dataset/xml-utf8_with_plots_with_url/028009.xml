<plot>Hwang Nam gets drunk and intends to spend the night with the prostitute, Min-ja. However she ends up telling him the story of her life as a 'comfort woman'--the term used for women forced to become sex slaves by foreign soldiers. Nam becomes so touched by her story that he gives her all his money. He then leaves her so he can think of a way to improve the lives of people like Min-ja.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?028009</url></doc>
