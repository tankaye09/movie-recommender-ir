<plot>A quirky love story set in the suburbs of South London, about a Koi Carp enthusiast who realizes his obsession with fish is ruining his marriage. Mike and his friend Pete return home after a competition to discover Mike's distraught wife has swapped places with a prize fish. Even though his wife seems to have had some kind of breakdown, Pete can think of nothing else except his fish. His lack of compassion has a palpable effect on Mike who comes to realize that his own relationship may be suffering as a result of the same selfish behavior. On his way back home, Pete makes a life changing decision. This film is about obsession, it's destructive effects on a relationship, redemption and forgiveness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341295</url></doc>
