<plot>Klaus Rifbjerg is a portrait that has the author talking about his work in a series of tableaux. Under three major headings, "Talking easily about great things", "Standing freely on all sides" and "Being able to receive" Rifbjerg starts by talking in a self-conscious, posed picture in which he is seated at his desk. From then onwards he is moved around a little as he continues to pronounce a series of deliberations on writing. He poses in the dunes, in his garden, and in front of his car, and we attend a meeting with his publisher, a tennis match, and a family luncheon. In the garden Rifbjerg also reads aloud from one of his many works. This verbose film was mainly shot in wide shots and very few scenes stand out. The final image, however, is a well-performed backward tracking shot showing Rifbjerg as he strides energetically along the beach in a frontal half wide shot.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294161</url></doc>
