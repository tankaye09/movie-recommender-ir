<plot>Tony Bennett sits in his apartment. A compulsive man. Repeatedly making his bed, arranging his things, checking to see if the doors and windows are locked. He has no job, no friends. He is allowed to collect from social services until he gets back on his feet. He's on probation for the next 5 years. Today is the first day his Probation Officer comes to the house. He can't bring himself to take down all Grace's pictures. They wallpaper his room. He sits on a wooden chair... waiting... The clock ticks away on the wall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263405</url></doc>
