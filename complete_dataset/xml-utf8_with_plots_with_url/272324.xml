<plot>Jackpot is the story of the super rich, indulging their depravity out of the boredom of needing nothing and having everything. A rich young heiress played by the sensational Lisa Marks has hired a companion for the weekend and tells him the saga of how she came into her fortune. Her father, a tycoon is into playing games for high stakes, in this case his friend's wife. Little does he know that everyone has their own game to play; his wife and their very sexy maid, and the man out to con him out of a fortune. The entire film is lushly photographed in the luxury surroundings of velvet and chrome, Rolls Royces and champagne. JACKPOT is an adventure in eroticism, intrigue and savage desires that only a few can afford.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272324</url></doc>
