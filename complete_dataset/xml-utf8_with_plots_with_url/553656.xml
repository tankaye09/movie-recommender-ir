<plot>Robert, a mysterious loner, drives his car endlessly at night. No destination; no clue as to where he's come from, except a guilty conscience and a sleeping bag on the back seat. Late at night, all back roads are the same and the dark is oppressive, disorienting. He could almost be in any country at any time. It's impossible to tell. On a desolate country lane, Elaine, a young woman, flags him down, looking for help. Confused and vulnerable, she needs a ride out of town, and perhaps a sympathetic ear on the way. As the night grows longer, though, Elaine will discover that not all strangers are to be trusted - and that Robert might just have run out of help to give. Two strangers, the threatening night, and an open road - but what sinister secret lies at the journey's end...?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553656</url></doc>
