<plot>When a man and woman return home unexpectedly and start making love, the thief who had broken in has to hide. They fall asleep, and he sneaks into their bedroom and starts pilfering jewellery. He spots a diamond ring on the woman, and decides to try for that too, but when he touches her hand, she subconsciously thinks it's her lover, and drags him into bed. He manages to extricate himself and slip the ring off her finger, but on his way downstairs he trips and wakes her. Before he can get out the door, she confronts him, and turns out to be his ex-fiancee, off whom he's trying to steal back her engagement ring, because he can't afford to pay for it!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586979</url></doc>
