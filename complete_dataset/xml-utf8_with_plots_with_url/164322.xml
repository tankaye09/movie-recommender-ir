A valet comes with the house and he spends a lot of time trying to soften Kennedy;s rough edges, but when he becomes to insistent about giving his master a bath, the always-irritable Kennedy throws the valet in the hot tub, clothes and all. Meanwhile, his father-in-law has been putting the squeeze on Edgar's boss, telling him that Edsgar has fallen heir to so much money he is going to buy out the business and fire his boss.
