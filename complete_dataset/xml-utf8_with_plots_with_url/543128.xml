<plot>A Made for Television English Documentary TV series that explores English cinema through clips from various films. The series was a casual examination of English films and not very informative to those already into the subject. The Episodes were themed ( ie: "The War Games", "Heroes"). The episodes were 25 minutes long and were narrated by John Mills.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?543128</url></doc>
