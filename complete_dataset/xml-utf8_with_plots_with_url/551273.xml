<plot>An intellectual and farcical comedy that fades up on a New York cafe &amp; bar, bustling with hipsters, poets, and posers. Our main man, Joseph, steps up to the mic and begins a Network-style self-important rant about the twenty-something generation. Joseph's problem is with his own generation of bored, unhappy cynics. He thinks the hipster generation is so preoccupied with being cool, that they won't believe in anything. But Joe doesn't want to be jaded anymore, so he's going to start a cult of sincerity. He wants to find something to believe in, something simple enough to put on a T-shirt. Reminiscent of Don Quixote, Joseph sets out to find the most genuine thing you could ever say to anyone. And secretly, Joseph's trying to get his divorced parents back together. Joseph immediately starts trying to be "true-blue," by opening doors for strangers, planting trees in the city, and apologizing to anyone who'll listen for things like chauvinism, sarcasm, and fascism. Along the way, he meets a cast of sleazy music agents, oversexed nihilists, pretentious filmmakers, and finally, an elderly woman who shows him that simplicity doesn't mean stupidity. But by then it's too late. "The cult of sincerity" has been appropriated by Joseph's community as the next hip-status movement. Joe finds himself in the same caf√© as before, surrounded by "cult" buttons, trucker hats, and phony fans. And Joe must now decide between fake sincerity and genuine mistrust. The Cult of Sincerity is the witty exploration of changing friendships, permanent regrets, and hope in the age of irony.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?551273</url></doc>
