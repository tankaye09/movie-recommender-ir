<plot>This top-down, turn-based strategy game was the predecessor to the popular "Heroes of Might &amp; Magic" series. As knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, you must amass an army of creatures to battle through a fantasy world, and construct a map in search for the twenty-five pieces of the Scepter of Order, a magical artifact which long had kept the forces of darkness from invading the realm of King Magnus. Arech Dragonbeath, leader of the Dark Legions, stole the Scepter, broke it, hid the pieces and unleashed his evil forces. Now, you are in a race against time to prevent Dragonbreath's minions from taking control of the realm. As you capture Dragonbreath's forces, you advance in army leadership ability, spell power and knowledge, and weekly commission earnings with which to hire more creatures into your army in your quest to rebuild the Scepter and drive out the evil invaders.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292710</url></doc>
