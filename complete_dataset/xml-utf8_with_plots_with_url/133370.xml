<plot>In the early morning of August 4, 1977, a veteran Los Angeles police officer, from the Ramparts Division, stopped his car to investigate Ron Burkhold, a naked unarmed man on a street corner. Within minutes, Burkholder lay dead, shot six times. The use of deadly force continues to be a recurring and divisive issue in communities across the nation. This powerful and provocative documentary examines police accountability for civilian fatalities by focusing on a killing that rocked Los Angeles and led to the re-writing of the city's gun policy. Scenes are filmed inside the Coroner's inquest, and district attorney's offices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133370</url></doc>
