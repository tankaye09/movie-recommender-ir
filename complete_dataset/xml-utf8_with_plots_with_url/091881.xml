<plot>In Spain, since the 1920s, it is a tradition to celebrate the New Year with the sound of the bell of the clock in La Puerta del Sol, which is just in front of the point where all roads in Spain start, "the km 0", by eating 12 grapes, one for each bell sound. This tradition starts when, one year, there was too much production of grapes. The producers talked about "the lucky grapes", and gave them for free to celebrate the New Year. This tradition has gone more and more popular. Nowadays there is no Spaniard that doesn't follow this tradition. In the past, until 1962, radio broadcasting made possible for everybody to follow the sound of the bell and eat the grapes. Since 1962, TVE made the tradition even more closer giving it the image of the clock. It is not until 1991 that there have been hosts to this event, before there were only voice commentators. Since 1991, we also see the host that guide us in the way the clock works and how we have to eat the grapes. It is a live transmission that cannot be avoided if you are in Spain, all broadcasting channels connect with the clock when New Year is about to begin.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091881</url></doc>
