<plot>Jonathan Hensleigh knows good action. This former attorney stopped practicing law to pursue screenwriting, and with his big break writing episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, his foray into the action/adventure genre began. After writing the screenplay for Die Hard: With a Vengeance, he worked on the films Jumanji, The Saint, Armageddon and The Rock. Hensleigh also wrote and directed the film adaptation of Marvel Comics' The Punisher, for which he is also writing the sequel. In this no-holds-barred interview, learn his approach to developing action scenes and what he really thinks about screenwriting classes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553272</url></doc>
