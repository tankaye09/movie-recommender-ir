<plot>Angela has been kept inside the "boxed paradise" (their home) for all the years of her life. Her very traditional, obsessive-compulsive and overprotective mother takes care of her long, beautiful hair, yielding to their family tradition that "a woman can only be beautiful if she has long hair." But the irony lies on the fact that her mom pulls her hair everytime she gets mad at her. Until the grand celebration of her debut (18th birthday), her hair becoming bars of cage on her face exemplifies her imprisonment. The house sequences promoted the feeling of constriction-as the mansion-type house became a cage to Angela-grand and yet constricting. As the film progressed, the visuals gradually became more and more dynamic as Angela's liberation drew nearer and nearer. The enriching of the film's mood and temperament was utilized through magic realism. And in compliance with their family's legacy, Angela's hair symbolized her mother's complete authority over her - the strands of her hair, becoming bars of cage on her face, exemplify her imprisonment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287373</url></doc>
