<plot>The disturbing and the satirical come together in this fractured tale of suburban angst and ennui, which revolves around the marital difficulties of Michael Eisner, a psychiatrist who constantly squabbles with his domineering executive wife, Jane, at the expense of the mental health of their prepubescent son, Alex. The story intersects that of Ted Sacks, a budding child pedophile who loses his job as a data recovery specialist and slips further into the seedy chatroom-centric realm of would-be child molesters. He soon grows tired of chatting about molesting "boyz" and begins stalking them in Alex's neighborhood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248526</url></doc>
