<plot>Rosa and Carlos, the ghosts of young Spanish republicans, roam the ruins of Belchite in Northern Spain, waiting for the discovery of their unmarked graves. For three weeks in the burning hot summer of 1937 in the Spanish civil war, the medieval town of Belchite was blasted to pieces by republicans and fascist fighters and left in ruins. Franco dubbed it the symbol of the fascist victory and for 70 years Belchite has slowly crumbled over the bodies of the dead, while next door in a new 'modern' town built by republican prisoners, people go about their daily lives shutting their ears to the sounds of falling walls and the whispers of the dead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401145</url></doc>
