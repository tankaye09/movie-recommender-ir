<plot>Percival Montague marries a penniless American and is disowned by his father, Lord Battleaxe, an English Duke. Monty and wife Mary head to the United States, promising to make a fortune. A few months later, they're looking for work of any kind. They hire on as waiter and cook at a nice Manhattan hotel. Monty shaves his mustache, but can't stop using his monocle, so he's teased constantly by the other hotel staff. He runs into trouble when people he knows arrive at the hotel. He pretends to be a fellow guest, joins them in revelry, and may lose his job. Mary is alarmed. Monty decides to tell his friends the real reason he's dressed as he is. Is this their lot?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235250</url></doc>
