<plot>Vera is on a train traveling to her wedding to George Baker, which was arranged when she was a child and whom she has never met, and meets and falls in love with George Smith, who is actually her intended bridegroom, but she doesn't know it. Her friend Grace advises Vera to act crazy when she arrives at the Baker estate, and the snooty Mrs. Baker will call off the wedding. Vera does so and Mrs. Baker is ready to call it quits on her son marring the loony Vera, when George makes his appearance and Vera realizes he is the man she fell in love with on the train. She then tries to makes amends for her weird behavior, but the harder she tries, the more she confirms Mrs. Baker's opinion that she is a genuine fruitcake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666358</url></doc>
