<plot>The world is entirely covered with water. Two men, a father and a son, seem to be the only survivors. They bear up against the ordeal of life in a vast water desert by holding out on a derelict factory chimney. One day the son retrieves from the water the most unlikely proof that there must be other survivors out there - a piece of human excrement. Now, the monotonous life gets stirred up as the son, longing for love, indulges in the idea that the piece of human waste matter might actually belong ... to a woman. An unusual love story unfolds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198439</url></doc>
