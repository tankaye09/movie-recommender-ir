<plot>This is a documentary short about five caregivers who have given up the things in their lives that made them who they were, in order to transform into who they are, caregivers. Each has a member of their family who has a disability or a chronic illness and needs help performing the daily activities of life that many of us take for granted. Just like a parent of a newborn, oftentimes those needing care are able to do little for themselves and depend upon those who give the care. The caregivers, in turn, create a life that is dependent upon the care and life of the afflicted person. This film attempts to be an instrument in which these five can share their stories and for some, the venting of long pent up emotions that they have had no other avenue for expressing. In turn, "Caregiver" becomes a film which shows that someone's disability or illness does not just affect them, but their entire family. It also informs us that no caregiver is a hero, a saint, or a sap. They are also not completely unique or alone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?094285</url></doc>
