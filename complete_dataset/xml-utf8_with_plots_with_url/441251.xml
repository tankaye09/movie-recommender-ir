<plot>When the Rangers visit the set of an action film, a stuntman is injured and Wes (Red Ranger) volunteers to fill in. But the Rangers soon discover that they're the unwilling stars of a reality movie titled "The End of the Rangers". The director turns into Cinecon, a mutant who transports the teens into different movie scenes, each filled with life-threatening dangers and challenges...and a script that calls for their demise. Is this the the final curtain for the Rangers...or will they survive to find fame and fortune in Tinseltown? Mitch, a young photographer for the local paper, hires Katie (Yellow Ranger) to help him on a big assignment-to reveal the identities of the Power Rangers. When the mutant Artillicon attacks the Rangers, Mitch and Katie go to take photos but Katie sneaks off to help her friends. In the fight, she and the Rangers are demorphed and Mitch captures it on film. She begs him not to publish the photos but he can't afford to lose his job. The mutant grows and attacks again. Can the weakened Rangers defeat Artillicon? And, if they survive, will they be exposed by Mitch? We shutter to think.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?441251</url></doc>
