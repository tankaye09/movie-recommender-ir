<plot>Renato is 27 years old and is severely disabled. Standing only 2'6" with leg and spinal deformaties one would think he would lead an inactive life. But this man works 6 days a week selling 'Lotto' tickets to help send his siblings to school. He lives with 10 other members of his family in one of the many squatter areas in Manila. He has many things going against him but what he has going for him, is attitude.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513267</url></doc>
