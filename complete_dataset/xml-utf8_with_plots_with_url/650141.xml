<plot>What Does Women in horror mean to you? Well to us at Last Doorway Productions it means how women have created and supported horror films and the genre at all levels and how they feel about the business in general. In the past the films used to be dominated by stereotypes in a mostly male dominated genre. So let us take you on a journey into the female psyche and see how they view and create the Horror Genre. Welcome To My Darkside-Women in Horror! A Documentary from Last Doorway Productions examines women's roles in the horror genre. The film takes a look at women in all aspects of the filmmaking process, from the scream queens of the 60's and 70's to women producing and directing today's horror hits. The documentary, due for release mid 2009, is directed by Independent Horror Filmmaker and Horror Host Reyna Young and it explores how women's roles in the industry have changed over the years and how women have led that change in a predominantly male-dominated genre. We take a look at Actress's, Models, Photographers, Special FX, Directors, Journalists, and Horror Hosts. Featuring in the Documentary is Reyna Young, Shannon Lark, Priscilla Ozuna, Judy Cerda, Felissa Rose, Lynn Lowry, Elske Mccain, Nikki K Homicide, Heidi Martinuzzi, Bianca Barnett, April Burril, Ms. Monster, Rachel Grubb and many more.... The DVD will include interviews with women in horror, movie clips and lots of special features.
