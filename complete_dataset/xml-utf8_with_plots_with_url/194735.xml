<plot>In Final Exit, an aged one is confronted with his options in blunt terms. Does he want to drag out his existence, increasingly infirm and a burden to his caretakers, or go quietly before resentment overwhelms sentiment? Does he wish to go on living, the quality of his life increasingly diminishing, or be euthanized? Would he prefer cremation or burial? This tape confronts the issues of mortality and advancing decrepitude that faces even the friskiest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?194735</url></doc>
