<plot>A classic tale of a man alone - facing an unknown enemy in a world without friends or refuge left to resort to only to his own cunning and courage. Sometimes heroes can be found in the most unlikely of figures-none-so-unlikely as Frank Graham. Frank is an accountant, a man who lives a quiet life, more at home with numbers than human-beings. Suddenly a gorgeous woman enters in his life, introduces herself with the unlikely name of Lola and hands him her phone number.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037451</url></doc>
