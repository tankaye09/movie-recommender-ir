<plot>Hooligan begs food from a farmer's wife on the promise to saw some wood. Having devoured his dinner he starts off, but is stopped by the farmer's wife with a gun. Hooligan objects but with the gun staring in his face he is forced to saw away for dear life. Very well done and humorous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037534</url></doc>
