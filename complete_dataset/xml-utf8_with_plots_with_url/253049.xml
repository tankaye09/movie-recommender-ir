<plot>Dr. Shivani Dutt lives a wealthy lifestyle in London, England, along with her widowed mom, and a dog named Kaali. She works at the Thomwell Hospital. One day she notices that some of her fellow doctors indulge in organ trafficking, and decides to expose them. Before she could do anything, her car has an accident, and she ends up in the very same hospital as a comatose patient. Her condition remains serious, and she continues to be on life-support systems, without any chance of future recovery. The doctors recommend to her mother that the life support systems be turned off. Unable to speak for herself Shivani's troubled spirit arises and attempts to find someone to convince them about her situation. The only one who can understand her is egoistical 'British Raj' TV host, Raj Jaiswal, who believes that he is irresistible to women. A disbelieving Raj is finally convinced, and together with Akshay Kapoor, they decide to abduct Shivani's body from the hospital to his residence. Watch what happens when events spiral out of control and a Bollywood-speaking Police Inspector named John Smith starts taking a special interest in Raj and the case of Shivani's missing body.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253049</url></doc>
