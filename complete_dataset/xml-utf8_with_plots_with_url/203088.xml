<plot>This is a moving picture of the well known comedian, Fred Poplar. He appears on the stage accompanied by a dummy of a man, and the two apparently engage in an animated conversation. It is presumed that the dummy does not agree with his partner, and they proceed to engage in a fight. Judging from their actions, each has an even chance of winning. To say the least, this picture creates roars of laughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203088</url></doc>
