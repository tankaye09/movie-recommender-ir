<plot>"Dream Networks" is a company offering to solve your problems - no matter what it is. But are they really helping? Or are they just using you without your knowledge to satisfy their own devilish purposes? How much would you be willing to pay? Not an easy answer, if the question is "to live, or not to live". "Dream Networks" is a story about a guy who does not want to jeopardize the most valuable thing he has, his family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159401</url></doc>
