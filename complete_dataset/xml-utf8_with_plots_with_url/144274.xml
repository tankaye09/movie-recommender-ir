<plot>Taking Kafkian propositions into satire, "Diagnose" tells the story of FRANZ FLÃ–TER, a nice chap who's only problem is a paralysed thumb that stands too awkwardly up. He doesn't like the position in which his thumb stands and wants to have it operated to make it more discreet. Why shouldn't he? After all in his country people are free to do whatever they want with their body. The problem is that because of the bureaucratic inefficiency of the hospital, FRANZ keeps on being mistaken for other patients. Finally a defective machine considers him dead. That's when he gets taken to the basement to be dissolved in acid! In a last hallucinatory flash before painfully dying, FRANZ will reconsider his so-called "freedom".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144274</url></doc>
