<plot>In this documentary shows the journey by bicycle, helicopter, and car from Chicago to LaSalle on this 19th century canal, which is the last link of canals and waterways connecting the east to the Mississippi River down to the Gulf of Mexico. This canal was the 'super highway' of its day. Although it was well known at the time, most people today don't know what the I &amp; M Canal is, much less its history. In this video, some of the industries along the canal are spotlighted and also how it was used as a sewer for Chicago. This canal helped make Chicago what it is today - little known facts about Lincoln's debate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151791</url></doc>
