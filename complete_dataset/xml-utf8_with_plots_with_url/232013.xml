<plot>Hawa Kay Naam (For a place under the Heavens) is Sabiha's personal journey through the Islamization of Pakistan. From her own perspective, she depicts the transformation of the Pakistani from a vibrant, liberal society into a more conservative, religious-oriented one. Sabiha interviews five women, in search of answers regarding the issue of this growing religiosity. Why are more and more women taking to the hijab when there is no state directive to do so? What is the true nature of this creeping Islamization? What are the liberal forces doing?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232013</url></doc>
