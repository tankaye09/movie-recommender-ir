<plot>This short-lived attempt to revive live comedy on Channel 7 was a combination of interviews, popular culture, trivia and topical current affairs with a light hearted bent. The program was equally hosted by all the those credited in the cast, although Richard Stubbs took a leading role. The program was initially the second half hour in an hour, and was preceded by a woefully bad 'The Big News'. Soon, however, 'The Big News' was axed and 'The Late Report' took over the entire hour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570088</url></doc>
