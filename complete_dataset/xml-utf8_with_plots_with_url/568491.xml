<plot>"The Kingdom of Could Be You" was a spin-off series of "The Most Important Person;" it explored the various occupations adults have as well as what school-aged children would like to do when they get older, hence the title. The animated kids from "The Most Important Person" (Mike, Cindy, Nicola, Pablo, etc.) returned, but in place of Fumble, Hairy, and Bird, they were joined by a wizard who acted as their guide through the kingdom and who often cast spells that backfired. There was also an unnamed creature that looked like part duck and part bumblebee that provided commentary throughout each episode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568491</url></doc>
