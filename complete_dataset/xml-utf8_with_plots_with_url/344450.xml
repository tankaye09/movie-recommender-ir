<plot>Al lives a simple life, peddling office supplies through his workplace, Micro-Tweeze, where no hair goes undetected! The highlight of his day is Bridgette, the spastic office vixen. He often dreams of working up the nerve to ask her out. But his desire must first be approved in The Central Post Between Thought and reality, the meeting chamber in his head where all of his personalities duke it out. His libido Mr. Fuckit, his conscience Mr. Wise, and Frank the Fear Monster, compete to have control over Al's actions. In the end, it is Al himself, who must find his own voice to silence them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344450</url></doc>
