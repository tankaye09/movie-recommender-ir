<plot>Terror bombing after terror bombing, day after day. Never has a nation had to endure such attacks. A sidewalk caf√© becomes as dangerous as a military outpost. A simple trip to the supermarket becomes a horror of flying nails, glass and death. How do Israelis deal with this pervasive terror? How do they explain their near-solitude in the world? How do they really feel about Arabs? These are some of the questions that one of America's most respected thinkers, Dennis Prager, went to Israel to find answers to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269534</url></doc>
