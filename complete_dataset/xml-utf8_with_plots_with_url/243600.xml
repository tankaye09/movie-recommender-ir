<plot>Holo is a cyberpunk story about a totalitarian future society where technology and cyberware are the key to everything, even life. In a world where dissent is viewed as subversive and politically dangerous, any perceived condemnation of the governmental regime is a threat. Rebellion is kept in check through a series of punishments that starkly demonstrate the necessity to conform.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243600</url></doc>
