<plot>The first scene is a panoramic view of Nature's main entrance to the Garden taken from a mesa opposite. The towering white and terra-cotta rocks are seen through the whole picture, Pike's Peak appearing in the distance through the gateway. The second section is also a panoramic view of the entrance, but it is taken from the inside of the Garden. This picture shows many of the queer formations, among which may be noticed the Temple of Montezuma, the Kissing Camels, the Sioux Head, General Washington, the Two Gods, and the Gateway. The third section is a scene of the life in the garden. The celebrated "Balanced Rock" forms the background and before it passes the native burro, the cracker outfit, bronchos, and at the end a photographer very humorously pursues his vocation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422083</url></doc>
