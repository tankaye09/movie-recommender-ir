<plot>One of the greatest attractions at the famous Summer resort, Coney Island, N. Y. A huge elephant stands at the top of the chutes and prepares for his trip. At his back is another elephant who starts his companion. The huge animal assumes a sitting position as he leaves the top and like a flash slides down the steep incline into the water. He strikes the water with a tremendous splash, remains under the water for a short time, enjoying his cool bath. It takes considerable coaxing on the part of his Arabian keeper to get him to come out of the water.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175213</url></doc>
