<plot>NBC joins partner Sports Illustrated to launch a nation-wide search for the next great swimsuit supermodel with its new unscripted series timed for the launch of the magazine's famed annual Swimsuit Issue. During Sports Illustrated's search for an undiscovered model for the popular Swimsuit Issue, the six-episode series will focus on what it takes to become a successful swimsuit model. Twelve selected finalists will live in Los Angeles where they will compete for the chance to appear in the best selling issue of any magazine in the world and win a million-dollar modeling contract from NEXT Model Management. The series and competition culminate with the final two contestants who will be flown to an exotic location to shoot a photo spread for Sports Illustrated. No one will know who the winner will be until America votes as part of the series finale in February. Charged with the task of whittling down the field of hopeful models is a three-judge panel including former Sports Illustrated model Roshumba Williams, NEXT Model Management President Joel Wilkenfeld and Sports Illustrated swimsuit editor Jule Campbell. "The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Search" is produced by Pariah, PB &amp; J Television and Sports Illustrated. Gavin Polone, Patty Ivins, Julie Pizzi, Terry McDonell and Roy S. Johnson executive produce the series.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511281</url></doc>
