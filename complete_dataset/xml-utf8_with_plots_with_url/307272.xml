<plot>A peddler of "the best glue" sets up his outdoor stall. A crowd gathers for a demonstration. As he gives his pitch, two observant cops decide drive off his customers and close him down, much to his fury. He seeks revenge as they sit on a park bench. Incensed, they give chase to administer frontier justice. The crowd, with a mob's psyche, cheers on whomever is on top. It's a pity because this glue really does work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?307272</url></doc>
