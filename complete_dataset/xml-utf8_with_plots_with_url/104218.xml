<plot>Erwin Vanderveer just decided his know it all father was right all along, maybe a Harvard education really shouldn't be wasted on a silly aspiration of becoming the next Hollywood superstar. Failed dreams in hand, he boards a bus towards home to face his fathers music. Little does Erwin know but his journey will come to an unexpected end at a diner in Abilene, TX where a foul-mouthed washed up old oilman is waiting. Merle is on the brink of losing his land to bank foreclosure on the count of not being able to find a single damn drop of oil on it. To make matters worse, he still can't find a way to tell Faye, the town's favorite waitress, that he is in love with her. Fortunately for him, a young man just walked into the local diner, who just might be the answer to his mounting problems. Together these two are about to go on a wild adventure to save Merle's land, get his girl, and restore Erwin's faith in dreams. To do it they'll need a little country boy charm, ivy-league ingenuity, and some good old-fashioned acting talent. This is the story of hope and redemption, and how it can sometimes be found in the unlikeliest of people and places.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104218</url></doc>
