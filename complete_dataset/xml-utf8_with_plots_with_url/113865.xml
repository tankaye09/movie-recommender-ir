<plot>Meet Joe Zara: son of an Italian railroad worker who came to the United States during the immigration boom of the early 20th century. Growing up with 12 brothers and sisters in a small row house in Trenton, New Jersey wasn't easy for Joe, but he managed to make it work. Now, he's ready to tell the world how his cramped upbringing helped him form solid opinions on everything from the Catholic Church to gambling addiction. Join filmmaker Fred Zara, Joe's son, as he turns the lens on his father to uncover confessions a lifetime in the making.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113865</url></doc>
