<plot>"This is an exhibition drill by the Charleston Cadets of Boston, Mass. At the opening of the picture the men are behind a trench in a swamp firing at random. At the order of 'Rapid Fire, Charge,' the men spring to their feet with a cheer, charge through the swamp, leaping over ditches, and force their way through the underbrush. This scene is lively and realistic."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?455531</url></doc>
