<plot>Grace is an aspiring writer while Christian is an aspiring actor. Their differences over each others' chosen path is just the beginning of the end of their deteriorating relationship. Heightened, theatrical monologues are performed by a 'Female Provocateur' and a 'Male Provocateur'. They serve as not only representations of Grace and Christian's underlying emotions but also reflect the universal factors people may feel and experience when involved in a relationship that is heading toward destruction. A mysterious character known as the 'Purpose Maker' serves as the narrator of the piece and frequently comments on Grace and Christian while attempting to find justification for their behavior.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082252</url></doc>
