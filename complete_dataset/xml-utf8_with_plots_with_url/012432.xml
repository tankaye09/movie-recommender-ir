<plot>Paul has just lost his girlfriend, his job, his dignity, and gained a rash. With nothing left to live for, so he decides to end it all. After several failed attempts at suicide, Paul opts for the next best thing: asking complete strangers on the street to kill him. Strangely enough, everyone walks away from him. While Paul is moping on a park bench, George happens upon him. Paul discovers that George used to be just like him. George passes on the advice that whenever he is feeling down in the dumps and wants to cut the old life line, he thinks about all the misery of others and feels much happier. With that, George takes Paul on a whirlwind tour of misery, until Paul confronts his abusive ex-girlfriend. Can he stand up to her verbal bashing? Or is murder still in the cards?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012432</url></doc>
