<plot>The Unknown Comic at home preparing for a "hot date" that he has planned for that evening. However, when she calls and cancels, the frustrated "bag-head" decides, instead, to go bowling. He proceeds to take the viewers on a wild and crazy tour of the wackiest bowling center ever seen. Ultimately, after befriending the wise-cracking bowling instructor, the Unknown Comic is stunned to discover his "hot date" at the bowling center with another man! After a confrontation, the woman suggests the two men compete for her affections by having a bowling contest. It's comedy until the victor (guess who?) decides how he's going to celebrate his victory!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335764</url></doc>
