<plot>Inspired by a true story. Newly arrived in a small Oklahoma town after the death of his mother, high school wrestler MILES CARTER hopes his immersion in the sport will help ease his closed-off father, JACK, into having a normal relationship with him again. Though he does well on the team, coached by the charismatic, powerful, beloved COACH MAJORS (who coached Jack thirty years before), Miles is disturbed by the fact that the coach deliberately sets his scales light, giving his wrestlers as much as a ten pound advantage over their opponents. Pressured by his girlfriend, ADRIAN, into telling the truth about the cheating, an increasingly troubled Miles knows that his honesty will come with enormous consequences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095464</url></doc>
