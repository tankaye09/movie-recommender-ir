<plot>The fourth in the series of Senchimento no Kisetsu films, this one looks at the escapism aspects of romance. In the first part, a young woman decides on a whim to go with an older man offering to take her on a ride to the seashore. Though she feels some misgivings at first, the two gradually come to open up to each other. In the second part, a student starts a relationship with a college professor. Although it starts out as something merely physical, the two begin to explore the reasons for their attraction, and whether or not their relationship is something that can last.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485737</url></doc>
