<plot>An habitual, but good-natured, criminal is in and out of prison 38 times. Finally he is sentenced to 10 years though without a trial after facing the accusation of stealing a goat. Feeling certain that the elderly jailbird would die before his sentence is complete, the warden takes pity on him, helps him escape, and keeps the fugitive hidden in his home treating him like one of the family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101760</url></doc>
