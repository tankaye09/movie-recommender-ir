<plot>Cash Markman is trying to shoot a Mary Carey movie, but things keep going wrong, including the death of porn actor Steven St. Croix after doing his third sex scene of the day. The porn crew stuff St. Croix's body in a closet and try to finish their movie, until a cop shows up to check on their filming permit - which they don't have - and wonders what the funny smell from the closet is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095877</url></doc>
