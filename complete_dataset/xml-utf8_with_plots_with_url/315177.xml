<plot>The body of Sinbad the diver turned up floating off the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. The mermaid has turned his soul into a turtle, and the turtle was the one who returned him to the world of men. Sinbad was born once more as a Miskito (Native Americans in Central America) and was raised on the banks of the wonderful Coco River. When he grew up, nature took care of carrying him back to the sea, where the mermaid is waiting for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?315177</url></doc>
