<plot>Kent steals some wood from a lumber yard for some construction work on a baseball field. Afterwards he feels guilty about it, and goes to see a lawyer for advice on what to do. The lawyer gives him a speech about how disrespect for the law can lead to even worse crimes than stealing. After Kent shows the proper amount of contrition, the lawyer cuts a deal with the lumber company to have Kent work off the value of the wood he stole, teaching Kent a valuable lesson: while all that high-falutin' talk about respect for the law may be important, having the money to afford a slick lawyer who can keep you out of jail is much more important.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655903</url></doc>
