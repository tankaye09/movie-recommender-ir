<plot>As with how the lives of a single father and his daughter are intricately bound together. Tutos - the stitch sewn to join to pieces of cloth, makes a pair of trousers and earns a living for a tailor. Tutos is a story of a small town tailor Rey and his only daughter Elisa. Not having any other female around the house, Elisa grew up being a bit too tough for a lady, or "astia", something her father incessantly complains about. While Rey effortlessly makes pairs of trousers day in and day out, he agonizes over the cold and distant demeanor of Elisa. How long will it take before Rey creates a seamless relationship with his daughter? Will it be as easy as sewing a perfect piece of garment he so skillfully makes? Boyet, a loyal co-worker, is witness to this tattered and patched relationship that is just waiting to be sewn beautifully together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621515</url></doc>
