<plot>New Age City is raging with crime. Rivalling gangs fight amongst drugs, gambling and prostitution. The legal authorities are out of their depth and have been bribed, too. Amidst all this mayhem are Stevie Speed and Carmen Cobra. The pair's raids are legendary and even the biggest mafia bosses fear for their lives. The pair's reputation extends as far as Heaven and Hell. So it comes as no surprise that Satan himself has a crush on Carmen Cobra. He abducts her from the world of the living. Chained up in Hell, she is waiting for her boyfriend Stevie to rescue her. With the aid of a voodoo priest Stevie is teleported to Hell's gate and from there he will be fighting his way to his lover.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217432</url></doc>
