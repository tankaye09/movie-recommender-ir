<plot>This documentary follows one man's quest to save the last remaining stands of old-growth native Eastern and Carolina hemlock in the southeastern United States. The trees have been infested by an introduced insect pest - the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA). Entire ecosystems of rare ancient forests will now be lost and the southern Appalachian hemlock forests will lose much of their viability and biological diversity. The current and future loss is in great part due to the failure of the US Government to act promptly. Only a small fragment of intact old-growth hemlock forest remains free of infestation, but it can be saved if the financial and human resources are allocated in time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598700</url></doc>
