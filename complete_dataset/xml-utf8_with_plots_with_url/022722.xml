<plot>"Act of Honor," is an intimate portrait of a Mexican-American family dealing with the tragic death of their son, Rafael Peralta, who threw himself on top of a live grenade and saved the lives of several Marines in his unit during the battle of Fallujah, Iraq. "Act of Honor" traces Peralta's extraordinary journey from Tijuana, Mexico to San Diego to the streets of Iraq. A truly unique Immigration and War story, the film chronicles the extraordinary Peralta family, and several of the Marines as they come to terms with their loss and endeavor to move on with their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022722</url></doc>
