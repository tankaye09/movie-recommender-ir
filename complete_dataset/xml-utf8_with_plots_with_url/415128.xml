<plot>Suffering from an intense case of hypochondria, Jerry Conrad Walsh mostly keeps to himself. Between his home, his garden, and a well-visited hospital room, Jerry doesn't get out much... until he becomes obsessed. Warped by guilt and lies, when Paul moves in to the house next door, Jerry is not quick to open up. Over time they establish a relationship but little does Paul know that Jerry's many secrets and lies may have involved him all along... or does Paul already know? Meanwhile, Camille Young, a lonely teenage candy stripper at the community hospital, struggles to connect with one of her regular patients. As she learns of his secret fixation with another man, she offers advice that may very well be to her own disadvantage. A contemporary love triangle entangled through time, ORANGE is the story of two mens' struggle to cope with their pasts, and one lonely teenage girl who gets caught in the middle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415128</url></doc>
