<plot>Top agents of the KGB and CIA battle to posses a startling new scientific discovery. In the right hands, the discovery will create an end to famine and war. In the wrong hands, it's misuse will certainly destroy the world. The KGB supported "Ninja Organization" headed by the infamous "Number Zero" gains possession of the secret. CIA agent Tommy must single handedly defeat the Ninja and get the secret microfilm back. It seems a hopeless task, but being as brave as he is, Tommy tries every means.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071453</url></doc>
