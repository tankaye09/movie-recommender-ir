<plot>Showing women's day in one of the East Side public baths in New York City during summer. A large number of women and children are seen frolicking in the water. The patrons of these baths, being poor and unable to own regulation bathing costumes, are seen in old dresses of every description, making it a laughable as well as interesting subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394389</url></doc>
