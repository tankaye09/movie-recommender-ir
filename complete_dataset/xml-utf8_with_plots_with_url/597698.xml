<plot>Two rookie cops accidentally walk in on a gambling operation and arrest everyone there. And don't realize that several important people were there, one of whom is the mayor's mother. Because there was a lot of media coverage, they were promoted to detectives. And after the press no longer pay attention to them they are told that not only did they cause the mayor great embarassment but also ruined an operation. And in return for their efforts, they have been assigned to the 25th precinct or "two-five", which is were all of the department's screw ups are sent. All they have to wait for is another to take office. They also discover that the precinct's commander is weary of investigators being sent to check on him and not wanting to risk his pension he orders his men not to make any waves, which to do nothing. Feeling that they can't last there for long they try to come up with a way for the press to notice them and hopefully they can get the juice to get out of there.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597698</url></doc>
