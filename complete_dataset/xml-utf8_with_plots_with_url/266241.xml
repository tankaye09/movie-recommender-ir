<plot>A gang of small-time confidence-type crooks, led by the elderly Pop (Lafe McKee) and Mom Cobb (Rose Pulmmer), have just completed a small scam when a wallet found on a drunk gives them a big-time opportunity; it contains an appointment as a cashier in the Walnut Park bank. They put a member in the bank intending to escape with the deposits at the end of the week. To complete the pose, they attend Sunday church services and decide to go straight. When one of the group decides to run out with the money, they catch up with him at the border and return to the town as heroes. They all decide for a life of rural domesticity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266241</url></doc>
