<plot>Shades of Crimson is the tale of a painter, Sam, a young woman who is struggling to find recognition for her art. The story follows her inner turmoil about 'selling out' and all that it entails both as an artist and as a woman. Befriending a handsome, artistic neighbor allows Sam to dream of a hope that may not exist. She stumbles through a world of art galleries and lonely abodes searching for a connection; searching for a chance to be noticed. All the while her nightmares haunt her. The line between reality and dream become blurred. Will she regain her senses and find artistic success or will she give in to the darkness and become trapped by her own desires?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?489569</url></doc>
