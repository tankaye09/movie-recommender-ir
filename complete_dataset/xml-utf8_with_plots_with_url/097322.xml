<plot>Jack Proximo has seen a lot in his life - most of which hasn't happened yet. When an interview with potential employee Sheldon takes a sharp turn down lunatic lane, Jack's uncanny ability to see the future goes completely haywire causing the most explosive and far-reaching foresight he has had to date. In a last ditch effort to save his own life from this psychotic interviewee, Jack begins to describe to Sheldon the visions that are flashing before his eyes. We are flung into a futuristic society where machines and computers operate the basic necessities of human existence and Jack's great grandson Brian must save his daughter Abby from the dangers of a seemingly 'idealistic' society of no real work. The family story hidden within the haunting foresights that have cursed Jack his entire life proves to be his only hope for survival, in more ways than even Jack can imagine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097322</url></doc>
