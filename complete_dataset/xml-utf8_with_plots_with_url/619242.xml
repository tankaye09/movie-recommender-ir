<plot>The fifth chapter of the "Troublesome Night" series, this movie has three stories. The first story is about a taxi driver who gives five people/creatures a ride: a gang boss, a fake ghost, a mysterious old woman, an edgy lady and a real ghost. The second story is about a working class guy named Fat who moves to a new home with his wife and son to hide from his enemies. His new home is haunted by a phantom, and it appears to be responsible for the guy's sudden wealth and his family's uneasiness. The third story is about Fat's son, who has since grown up, and is employed as a night security officer at a business firm. There, he encounters paranormal events.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619242</url></doc>
