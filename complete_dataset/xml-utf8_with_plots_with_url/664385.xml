Marlowe is impressed by the head shots (drawings) of the actors that the Agent represents; Barely Maninuff (Barry Manilow) Chuck Gunnery (Sean Connery) Nigel Blackbum (Micheal Jackson)and Tony Scotchkins (Anthony Hopkins) amongst others.

And hence the rumor is started...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664385</url></doc>
