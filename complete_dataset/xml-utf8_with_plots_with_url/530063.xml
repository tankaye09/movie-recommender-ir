<plot>Talk Fast chronicles a week in the lives of five screenwriters living in Hollywood, all from various backgrounds-A puppeteer, a cult film star, a fallen starlet, a former stockbroker and a new mother - all with big dreams of seeing their scripts make it to the big screen. They scramble to prepare for an event called "Pitch Mart." Run by script doctor, award winning writer and former studio executive Ken Rotcop, the event gives many first time screenwriters a rare opportunity to sit down with major studio executives and make their best "two minute pitch."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530063</url></doc>
