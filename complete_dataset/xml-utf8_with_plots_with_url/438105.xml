<plot>"Nobbi, don' worry! I'll take care of your gem!" But elder boxer Norbert doesn't believe that! He's getting sick thinking that his daughter - his precious pearl - is going to marry this narcistic and newly rich guy Lukas. Full of anger he starts his shift as a taxi-driver, and the suddenly Ingrid gets in his car. She feels the same way, but deals with it differently. She takes Norbert into a long night, which brings him a new view oh his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?438105</url></doc>
