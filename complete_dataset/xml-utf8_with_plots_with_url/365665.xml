<plot>A provocative and moving film, "Men on Wheels" offers a rare glimpse into the intimate world of Omer &amp; Sammy, two IDF disabled veterans, dancing in a group combining paraplegics and their healthy, walking women partners. The film uncovers the damaged sexual self-image of the films' protagonists and the way they overcome it. Interwoven into their intimate life are scenes from the dance group as they rehearse to an approaching dance festival. Sammy travels to Holland to compete in the world wheelchair dance championships. Omer, following a deterioration of his health, decides to undergo a life threatening operation abroad. The two friends face the challenges they have undertaken only to prove that despite the wheels, they are men.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365665</url></doc>
