<plot>What do you get when you cross self-serving game show host Alex Getback with Tyrone, a grammatically challenged homeboy who only wants to win a few dollars so he can "turn his life around", with Keisha a sister who's on the show by very questionable means, with John, a George W. Bush loving, French conservative on a very urban and contemporary knock-off of America's second favorite game show - Jeopardy! Ummm, it's called Jepardee! Sit back, answer a question or two and laugh as these three contestants go at it head to head guessing your favorite questions about celebrities, hot sauce and old household appliances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275721</url></doc>
