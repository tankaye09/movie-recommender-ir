<plot>BLITZKID, a band eternally committed to their fans, has been in motion for nearly ten years, and still carries with them the same momentum, inspiration, and love that forged their beginning. Fame is not a goal with this band. There are more important issues that the band feels should be accomplished. Such as leaving great music, song and memories that will stand the test of time. With a consistently growing worldwide fan base and an untouchable live show, BLITZKID is at the front of Horror-rock's blood-soaked future. Their music is an amalgamation of punk, metal, thrash, goth and rockabilly. It is romantic and melodically hooky musically, disturbing and gory lyrically and intense and devastating sonically.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074968</url></doc>
