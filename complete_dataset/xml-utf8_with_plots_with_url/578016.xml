<plot>If you were to yahoo the words "moderate Muslim" today you would get more than 8 million hits on the internet. The invention of the epithet "moderate" and this renewed, twenty-first century interest in Muslims is the result of a post-9/11 Western world trying to make sense of Islam and its followers. The need to identify "militant Jihadists" by distinguishing them from moderate Muslims has cast suspicion on all Muslims in America. Stereotypes are becoming well-entrenched. The purpose of this documentary is to break those stereotypes by showcasing Pakistani Americans and asking them questions non-Muslim Americans have framed through vox pop interviews. A secondary goal is to educate people about the basic tenets of Islam in order to highlight similarities with the Judeo-Christian tradition.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578016</url></doc>
