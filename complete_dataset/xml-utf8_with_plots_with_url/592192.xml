<plot>THE SOUND Of THE BELL is the story of two young boys who have a drastically different vision of life yet sharing the same planet. Unlighted by the dream of going to school, JAVED lives by the dunes of Rajasthan in India where he has no other choice but to be a shepherd, at the cost of free education. The other boy, ALEX, lives in Yorkshire in England and goes to school everyday against his will. Alex doesn't understand the benefit of free education - why does he have to endure such a hard life when he could be free? Why is school so important? The Sound Of The Bell is the tale of one boy's dream that happens to be the nightmare of another one. Ironically, their differing frustrations lead them to retreat to a similar peaceful place in their respective countries where one enchanting tree stands out of nowhere. Only there, can they meditate and hope for a better world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592192</url></doc>
