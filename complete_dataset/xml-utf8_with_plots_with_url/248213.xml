<plot>A large figure of a man seated behind a table reading a paper is first seen. On the side of the paper toward the audience, one can plainly read the words, "How old is Ann?" Turning the paper over this meets his eyes; he lays the paper down with a sarcastic smile and begins to figure with pencil and pad. After several attempts, he becomes excited and tears his hair. Scene 2 shows him in a padded cell. A large blackboard is hanging on the wall at the top of which are the words, "How old is Ann?" The inmate of the cell looks up and observes the words, and springing to his feet, and seizing a piece of chalk, he attempts to do the problem again, but fails and he tries to dash his brains out against the wall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248213</url></doc>
