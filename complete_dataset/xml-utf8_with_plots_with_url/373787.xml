<plot>Twenty years ago, European telecoms operators signed a document that paved the way for global mobile. This agreement led to a common mobile standard - it gave us international roaming and lower cost handsets, but more than that, it changed forever the way we communicate. Mobile has spread through all aspects of life - no matter what our social and economic background. 'Mobile Planet' marks this anniversary by looking at the many diverse and varied uses of mobiles around the world. The film visits countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas, to witness the dramatic impact of mobile communications - from Indian fishermen to Afghan entrepreneurs; and from teenagers in Chile to AIDS doctors in Rwanda.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?373787</url></doc>
