<plot>The search for home, identity, loss, travel, and human connection are all themes explored in "Perhaps, Somewhere". David is a young man deeply affected by painful memories of his past as an adopted child. He chooses to live in protective solitude and silence to preserve a sense of his own identity. Maya is a young woman living a sheltered and confined life caring for her elderly sick mother. She longs for independence and in leaving home struggles with the guilt of abandoning her mother while being haunted with her memory. David and Maya are emotionally and physically detached from the world navigating through their uncertain past and present. An unusual chain of events leads to a chance encounter bringing them together. In meeting, they forge a brief yet deep bond, learning to understand themselves and one another, wondering where they will go next. It is this connection that moves them to find new pathways in their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429246</url></doc>
