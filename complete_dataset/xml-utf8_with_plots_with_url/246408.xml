<plot>What started off as a side-gig for a middle-aged, single mother to make a little extra cash, ignited into a full-time gig for a trio of talented women. "Hot Flash" introduces the world (outside of those blues purists) to a unique and inspiring group of musicians, named Saffire-The Uppity Blues Women. They offer a raw, but universal view you can only get from women who have lived...really lived - and can sing, shout and laugh about life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246408</url></doc>
