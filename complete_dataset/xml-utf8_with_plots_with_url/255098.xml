<plot>A comedy with heart. A simple trip to Washington turns into chaos when a farmer from the backwoods of Mississippi visits his pompous, city-slick brother to try to mend their bitter ten-year rift. Pierre (a writer for WDDC News with dreams of being the next Oprah) invites his older brother Zeek and his family to Maryland under to guise of mending their feud, but the cunning Pierre is only setting a trap that will cause their rift to become even bigger. Zeek (whose biggest goal is to carry out his father's deathbed plea) and his family fall into Pierre's trap, but Pierre is surprised when he gets snared by it himself. Zeek and Pierre clash from the word "hello", and the family of misfits embarrass Pierre and wreak havoc at every turn. Pierre's snooty Fianc√©e wants Zeek to leave and take Zeek and Pierre's cantankerous, elderly mother and Zeek's feisty wife with him. This modern-day Cain and Abel must work together when one suddenly stands to lose everything-that is, if they don't kill each other in the process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255098</url></doc>
