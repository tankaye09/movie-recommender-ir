<plot>As a young girl, Kurenai was leading a normal life. That is until her father was brutally murdered (for a powerful weapon) by 'The Black Lizard Clan' and she was left for dead, hanging on a wire for days. A few days later, Kurenai was rescued by some fellow Japanese People and was saved. Now an adult, Kurenai is seeking revenge on The Black Lizard Clan who killed her father and left her for dead, using the wire they hanged her with as a weapon called the tetsugen - which is just as deadly as she is. Players get to play as Kurenai, hacking and slashing and using lots of special abilities in this 'Kill Bill' style game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458238</url></doc>
