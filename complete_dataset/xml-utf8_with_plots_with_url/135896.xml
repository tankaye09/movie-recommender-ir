<plot>A sheepish pizza delivery boy wants nothing more than the love of his longtime crush and co-worker, Lisa. Unfortunately she is the daughter of his unforgiving and unrelenting boss, Papa B, who would rather Lisa date the star driver at the store, and Sean's rival, Joseph. Now Sean, accompanied by his best friend and fellow driver, the sexually charged Rahul, must endure muggings, off the wall co-workers, and Joseph's constant harassment in his quest for Lisa's heart. Whilst Rahul strives for his dream delivery, involving a lonely housewife short on cash and wishing to pay by 'alternate' means. When it seems that Lisa will end up with Joseph, and Sean's life will forever be nothing more than delivering pizza's, he must decide between the life he has or the life he wants in his heart. In the tradition of the great Disney Musicals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135896</url></doc>
