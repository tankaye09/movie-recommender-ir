<plot>Some of the steepest hills in the world are in the city of San Francisco, Cal. These hills are traversed daily by electric and cable cars and the trip up and down them is most thrilling. In this picture we give the audience a trip on the front platform of a cable car running down Union street, the steepest hill in San Francisco. The trip is begun from the top of the hill and one can see the business portion of the town many hundreds of feet below and seeming to be miles away. The trip is very thrilling and the subject entirely interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008078</url></doc>
