<plot>Lon Chaney was considered the "man of a thousand faces" for his facility with special makeup techniques which allowed him to transform into any role required by a motion picture script. In this one-time stage show, filmed on October 16, 2004 for a live audience at Universal Studios Citywalk, cast members portraying Chaney and several of his creations were brought to life on stage. This DVD is an edited version of the live-to-tape three-camera show as performed at ScreamFest LA. In addition to the seven live performers, many of Chaney's characters are shown as multimedia images that pass across the screen throughout.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017462</url></doc>
