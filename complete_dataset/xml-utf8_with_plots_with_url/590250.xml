<plot>Sometimes fighting for what you believe in can cost you your life. In 'The Sheep That Sleep' Jared Larkin has to take that risk. Set in 2034, the American government has implemented a new law that forces everyone to be taken away on their 50th birthday to meet their early death. All in the hopes to raise the failing economy. Jared, now in his last week, must find a way to escape his fate and save his wife. His only son is a member of the group running these executions so he will be of no help. If Jared can't find a way out within 5 days he will fall in line just like the everybody else.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?590250</url></doc>
