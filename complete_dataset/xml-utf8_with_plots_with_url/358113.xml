<plot>The discovery of a candy box full of matchbooks leads to a filmmaker's search for information about two female family legends. Marie and Mildred collected the matchbooks from various clubs, restaurants and tourist attractions in the 1920's to 1960's, supporting themselves through their careers as telephone operators. Chasing an image of Hollywood glamor, the women married late in their 40's, never had children, and spent much of their lives traveling. Using interviews, photos, family film footage and close-ups of individual matchbooks, the remnants of Marie and Mildred's lives are displayed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?358113</url></doc>
