<plot>The evil Zamindar of a small village has his lustful eyes on the beautiful wife of Jagga, a labourer, who also has a small son. He has her brought in by one of his men, and has her raped and killed. The son is also killed in this process. An enraged Jagga wants to avenge this humiliation, but in vain. He abducts one of two of the Zamindar's sons, and brings him up as his own. His motive is to raise this child in a responsible manner, and instill all the good values in him, so that he can then confront the evil Zamindar later. Years later, this young man has grown up to be called Badal, while the other son has grown up to be called Police Inspector Ram. Now Jagga is all set to avenge the humiliation and death of his wife and son, and pits the unknowing father and son against each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020407</url></doc>
