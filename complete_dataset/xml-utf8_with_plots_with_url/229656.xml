<plot>Hooligan introduces himself to the audience and also to a large juicy apple pie on a window sill. Happy Hooligan slouches around the corner of the house, and, spying the pie, gets outside of it. Having finished the pie, he turns his attention to a large pan on the window sill, full of ready mixed batter and flour. This he pulls over his head, and is immediately enveloped in a cloud of white flour dust as the cook appears in the window and discovers him. She promptly douses poor Hooligan with water.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229656</url></doc>
