<plot>This is a documentary film, built on the novelette-like principle. A historian, a political science expert and an artist start on a tour round the Balkan countries aiming to put an end to an old dispute - what should an all-Balkan text-book of history be like, since that is one of the ways to find a common ground for the Balkan peoples. Which of the events should be included in this general history book, which are to be highlighted and which should be passed over in silence? Is it possible for a history textbook of that kind to carry out the mission it's been assigned to - reconcile the irreconcilable? Is it really possible for such a textbook to be written?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057549</url></doc>
