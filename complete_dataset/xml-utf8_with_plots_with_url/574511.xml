<plot>In 2000, the King of Anyuak dies, naming one of his sons, Adongo Agada, as his successor. Anyuak is in the Sudan, with 70,000 people; civil war has raged for more than 20 years. Adongo is reluctant: he is newly in Canada, working and trying to bring his wife and eight children to join him. He returns to the Sudan, under armed guard. We see his coronation. He's a Christian conflicted by tribal beliefs in polygamy. He wants to modernize his people, build a school, and improve farming in the face of tradition. In an impoverished, war-weary land, can he leverage power? He also needs to take care of his family. Can he find a path to be both a wise leader and a responsible father? Is it good to be king?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574511</url></doc>
