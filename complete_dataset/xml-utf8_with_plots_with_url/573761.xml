<plot>This made-for-DVD documentary details the work that went into the production of A Sight for Sore Eyes, Shane Stanley's 2003 film about a successful but egotistical man who rethinks his life after discovering the changes the object of his old high school crush has gone through. Drama and romance fans are treated to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of this short but provocative work, as well as to interviews with the director and cast members, who give their insights into the efforts that were needed to bring this project to completion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573761</url></doc>
