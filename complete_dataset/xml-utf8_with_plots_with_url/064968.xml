<plot>Born near Kiev in 1882, Yakov Ben Dov came to Jerusalem from the Ukraine in 1907 with little more than a still camera to his name. He became one of the most accomplished photographers and filmmakers of his time, capturing the momentous events in his country. This eloquent portrait of an early cinema pioneer and a pioneering Zionist mingles astounding documents of early twentieth century Jerusalem with images of contemporary Israel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064968</url></doc>
