<plot>In this picture we present as fine a train as has ever been photographed; a picture of the day express which runs between Chicago, St. Paul and Minneapolis on the C. M. &amp; St. P. R. R. When the scene opens, the train is at a distance of considerably over a mile and appears not much larger than a mere speck on the screen. It gradually grows in size as it approaches the camera, until the volumes of smoke that are sent twirling into the air are plainly seen. The train approaches, as it were, straight at the audience, and rushes by at a sixty-mile an hour gait, making an entirely realistic scene. This is a perfect picture photographically. The train is generally conceded to be the finest and fastest in the United States.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582771</url></doc>
