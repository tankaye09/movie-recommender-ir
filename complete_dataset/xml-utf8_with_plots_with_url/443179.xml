<plot>If this were a future, it would have been mawkish! Now it's ruthless! She is Nelly Chervenusheva. The cinema fans know only her voice. For almost half a century Nelly interprets the great Italian cinema from the back of the hall at the Odeon film store cinema. The cabin is 1.30m at 1.50m. And this tiny space has accommodated;the whole of her Italy. And Nelly has never actually been in Italy.The film shows Nelly's tragically late meeting with Italy, when she's 78 years old, visiting the places she has only seen on film. She's finally with her princes: Ettore Scolla and Mario Monicelli. With a tender and merciless sentimentality the film reveals this late realization of dreams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?443179</url></doc>
