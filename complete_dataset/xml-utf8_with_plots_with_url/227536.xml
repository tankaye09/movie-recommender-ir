<plot>Woody Allen called them 'Kamikaze Women'. Whip smart, alluring as hell, dynamic, and sexually predatory. The kind of women that own every room they walk into, and who think of all men as 'boys'. Yet, just beneath the surface, there is an insecurity and fear they cannot face. HALE BOPP is the story of just such a woman; her name is Rachel. The year is 1997. The comet Hale-Bopp is shooting across the sky for the last time in 4000 years. And in Wicker Park (Chicago's answer to Greenwich Village), Rachel is about to meet her cosmic match. Ethan, a confident young architect and seeming 'perfect guy' has invested himself, and his heart, in women like Rachel before - and he is sure he has learned his lesson. Together, Ethan and Rachel navigate the course of a relationship that is as infuriating as it is inspired, as tender as it is passionate. But for Rachel, this love stirs not only untested emotions, but forces her to confront her past. She must look beyond her history with men into a childhood that stopped short because of a shocking event that she has buried deep inside herself. If she can come to terms with it, Rachel might just have a chance at love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227536</url></doc>
