<plot>This funny movie begins in silent movie style and a setting of the late 19th century. From a small summer hotel a young man comes, and on the beach a visibly enthusiastic girl is waiting. She has got a love letter, and this will be their first meeting. But when they are about to kiss, something goes wrong with the film. Their lips will move back and forth in irregular movements (not the same for both persons). Finally the movie will crack. After a four-letter word emitted by the cinema engineer, he will paste the movie together - though upside down. So first the water at the shore will fall upwards, and then the wreck of a small boat. The man will keep on catching hold in the sand, his feet pointing upwards. The girl will hold on to him but glide slowly and eventually fall. After a while the movie will be right. First the man will fall down on the sand, then the boat, then the girl, and then the water. The man, mostly covered by water, will try to reach the shore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?322178</url></doc>
