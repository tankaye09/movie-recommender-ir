<plot>"Maybellene" was recorded on May 21, 1955 and is referred to as the birth of rock 'n' roll history. Berry took an old Western swing-style song, gave it an extra kick with his signature electric guitar licks, and renamed it Maybellene. Berry's guitar style influenced an entire genre of musicians and the song had a tremendous social and cultural bearing in the transitional environment of the 1950's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260986</url></doc>
