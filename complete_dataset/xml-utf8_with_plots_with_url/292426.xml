<plot>Lati is only eight years old, but he already has a heavy load on his shoulders. Born in Tel Aviv to a Senegalese father and a Belarusian mother, he is heir to the throne of a Senegalese tribe. But he is also a typical Israeli child; a fan of McDonald's and especially of the local basketball team. . He is now about to travel to his kingdom for the first time where over one million of his subjects await his return. Told with a light, comic tone, this film highlights the personal cost of globalization and the dilemma we face as we straddle the crossroads of tradition and modernity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292426</url></doc>
