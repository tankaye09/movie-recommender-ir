<plot>An angry young death row rapist on the eve of his execution is compelled to meet with a persistent older visiting preacher. In their strange perceptions they confront each other in adult language over women, sex, God and nature of the universe. Intimidated, the preacher is coerced into confessing his sexual liaisons with women in his church. Their intense confrontation ultimately exposes them as opposite sides of the same coin. Reluctantly, the preacher must reveal a startling secret dramatically altering their relationship. Inadvertently, they find a unique way to experience a different kind of redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?614288</url></doc>
