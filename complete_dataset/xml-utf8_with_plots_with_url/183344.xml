<plot>The day to day life of the muppet-like inhabitants of a wind-up music box castle. This Castle is named Eureeka's Castle and it's owned by a giant. Of the inhabitants there's Eureeka, a young sorceress in training, Batly an egotistical bumbling bat, Magellan a one toothed dragon that has a tail with a mind of it's own, Bog and Quagmire otherwise known as the "Moat Twins" who just swim around in the moat, and there are also singing mice!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183344</url></doc>
