<plot>"I Wish You Love" offers a time capsule of Miss Dietrich's legendary stage act. The television special was taped in London over two days and later edited to a one-hour concert version. Dietrich wasn't pleased with the final result, saying that it "ain't as good," not on a par with her usual exellence. Still, if this late Dietrich concert doesn't show the diva at her most brilliant, it is still fascinating to watch her cast her spell over an audience and the artful way in which she manoevures their every emotion with her choreographed moves and song. She sings some of her old movie songs, war ballads and love songs. Highlights include her rendition of "Where have all the flowers gone."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253440</url></doc>
