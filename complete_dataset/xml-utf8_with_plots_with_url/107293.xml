<plot>Set just after Willy Wonka's death at 87, "Citizen Candy Man" is a mockumentary - a chocumentary - that imagines the characters from the 1971 cult children's classic "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" as they might appear today. First we see sad sack Charlie Bucket, who was promised the whole chocolate factory when he was 12, but was too timid to ever take it. Then we meet spoiled rich girl Veruca Salt, who has found other, more grownup ways to get what she wants, particularly from men. The two of them are locked in a legal battle over the Wonka estate, and both have reason to believe it should go to them. Charlie because he won the infamous Golden Ticket contest 30 years ago, and Veruca because of her personal and intimate relationship with the Candy Man himself. We also catch up with abrasive Mike TeeVee, gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde and gluttonous Augustus Gloop. Like Veruca, they all seem to have thrived in spite of their horrible personalities, and possibly because of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107293</url></doc>
