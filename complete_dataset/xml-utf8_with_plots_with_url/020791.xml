<plot>Kishan lives a poor lifestyle in Sitapur along with his sister, Gomti, and brother, Arjun. He is a farmer as well as operates a ferry service, while Gomti looks the household, and Arjun is away in the city for educational purposes. Abdul, a close friend of Kishan, helps him farming, and is treated like a family member. Kishan's marriage is arranged with Kiran, who loves him with all her heart and will do anything for him. Kishan is overjoyed when Arjun returns, but this joy turns sour when Arjun wants his brother to sell the land and re-locate to the city. Before Kishan could recover from this incident, he is told that Gomti and Adbul have eloped. A disbelieving and enraged Kishan decides to confront everyone who subscribes to this rumor leading to series of incidents which land him in the bad books of Police Inspector Tiwari, who arrests him for stealing from the Mandir.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020791</url></doc>
