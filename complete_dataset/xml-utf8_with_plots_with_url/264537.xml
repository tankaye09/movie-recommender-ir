<plot>Written and directed by Leondre Campos and Andres Pires Indo.doc has as it's main objective showing the effect caused by the tragedy in Sumatra, Indonesia, affected by the Tsunami of December 26th, 2004, and the earthquake of March 2005 that affected the same region. Leondre Campos went on this trip along with three other friends that volunteered to travel to the center of chaos. A real and risky adventure in search of magical waves and wonderful beaches that ended up as an expedition to the epicenter of the cataclysms in Asia. During their journey through the impressive scenario of Sumatra the group captured unforgettable images and heartfelt stories of places and people they met in their quest. More then a surf trip or a social expedition, Indo.doc became a message of hope and friendship in the middle of one of the biggest natural tragedies of our time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264537</url></doc>
