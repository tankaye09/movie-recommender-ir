<plot>In just over a decade, "mixed martial arts fighting" has gone from a novelty spectacle to a World Wide sport. The Ultimate Fighting Championship made its debut in the USA in 1993. Now over in the UK and bolstered by some heavy financial backing and unprecedented television coverage, the UK's version of UFC- Cage Rage has had sell out events at the huge Wembley conference centre with a card that included five UFC veterans (more than some UFCs!) and some of the biggest international names side by side with the cream of UK talent. No Holds Barred (NHB), Cage Fighting or Ultimate Fighting as it is now more commonly known, is a general term used to describe the convergence of boxing, jiu-jitsu, wrestling, kickboxing and judo into one form. There are so many ways in which to win - but just one mistake and you can lose. The best protection you can have is to be better than the next man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090405</url></doc>
