<plot>Manolis Sgouros, the youngest descendant of a generation of free Cretans, returns, as a young man now, to the land of his ancestors and becomes overseer of Captain Thanasis' estate, to whom, however, he has been introduced by a different name, as Manolis Xyladakis. By that same name he has met a girl as well, Maria, granddaughter of captain Thanasis. His intention is to keep his identity and origin secret, because he has serious reasons to believe that the Turks will wipe out anyone connected with him. However, he is recognized by captain Sifis, who reveals the secret to priest-Dimitris and contacts other captains who want to begin again the resistance against the occupiers which their ancestors began. The love of Sgouros for Maria, who is also fond of him, compels him to thwart the plans of an Italian who also wants to marry her and take advantage of her family's estate, which is rich in minerals. And when the latter turns him in to the Turks, the heroic Cretans rush to rescue him, and with their actions ignite the spark of a general uprising.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?405243</url></doc>
