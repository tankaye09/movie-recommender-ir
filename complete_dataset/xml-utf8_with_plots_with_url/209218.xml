<plot>As played at the Crystal Palace, London, England. This is a new sport and is the very opposite of foot-ball. A huge, rubber sphere, which is about ten feet in diameter, is pushed in opposite directions by the contending teams, and some very exciting rushes and scrambling ensue. Very novel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209218</url></doc>
