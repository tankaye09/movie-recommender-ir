<plot>This DVD includes a rare performance from the always intriguing Lene Lovich, with Thomas Dolby on synthesizer, at Studio 54 in NYC on December 4, 1981. On this night, Lovich projected her strong soprano with brilliance and explored the limitations of her voice in a way other New Wave experimental singers of the time could only dream about. Of this show, Stephen Holden of the NY Times wrote, "Miss Lovich put on a fascinating show in which she sang, played the saxophone and danced with a lurching spontaneity that seemed half-demented. Her favorite mode is a wild, hiccupy vocal attack that often breaks into semi-improvisatory bird calling that soars easily to an E-flat above high C."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329191</url></doc>
