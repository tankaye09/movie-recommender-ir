<plot>After the defense budget was cut during President Reagan's term in office, and Vice President George Bush having served as the ex-CIA director, a large portion of the intelligence community suffered greatly. Secret Cold War agents that thrived throughout the world could no longer be financially afforded and were considered a threat to the US as long as they were alive. The agents were assissinated in masses. All of which were killed...except one. But they know where she is. 18 years later, an international threat arises and the US government can not afford for the public to find out, so all normal means of action are impossible. Agent Janie Grey is found and black mailed into returning to service for one last mission. But she is torn...should she return in hopes of finally being forgotten, or should she betray the country that betrayed her. So four international agents are brought together to stop a Biblical prophesy. They are...the Lemures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329137</url></doc>
