<plot>The portrait of an American family... The Davis household is like many in today's American landscape; A mother, a stepfather, a son, and a daughter all living together in the outskirts of a Californian suburban city; built upon the pillars of divorce. An eerie obsession... Our young hero, Devin, is an introspective, artistic child whose imaginative glow is constantly put out by his stepfather's volatile behavior. Devin transcends melancholy earthly experience by escaping into the world of the extraterrestrial. From a young age, Devin has been obsessed with astronomy, space travel, and most significantly - the possibility of life existing in a world much like our own. A close encounter... One night, Devin wakes up to the sight of what he believes to be an alien lurking between the slates of moonlight that illuminate his bedroom. Time and time again Devin is visited and tormented by this strange figure that comes to him while everyone else is sleeping. Riding over an under-lying theme of child abuse and neglect, Devin must figure out a way to prove the existence of this stranger from somewhere other than this world is a very real and menacing danger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517529</url></doc>
