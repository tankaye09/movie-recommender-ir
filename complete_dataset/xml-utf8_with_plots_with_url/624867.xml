<plot>During World War II, in two operations in August 1942 the German Nazi kidnapped over 600 Slovene children up to 18 years of age and separated them from their parents. They were sent to child labour camps or adopted by Germans. Their parents were either arrested as bandits and most of them killed, or taken to concentration camps, from which only a few survived. At the end of the war, most of them returned home to find them empty or burnt down. They were named The Stolen Children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624867</url></doc>
