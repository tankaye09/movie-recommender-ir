<plot>It's 3:00 AM at the Firewater Club, and Stanley has had more than enough to drink. When he tries to take over leading the orchestra, the manager - a former boxer - lets him know that he needs to restrain himself. But it's not long before Stanley causes another disruption anyway, and when he then tries to dance with the manager's wife, the manager's patience finally runs out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432182</url></doc>
