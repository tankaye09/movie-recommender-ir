<plot>A comedy about a thirty-something man, named Victor who is to perform in a town, after having left group therapy. Victor cleverly bases his diatribes on the handful of locals who attend his performance. As his monologue coils out, his stories accurately reflect the audience's own lives, offering glimpses of themselves which irrevocably shift their relationship with each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247369</url></doc>
