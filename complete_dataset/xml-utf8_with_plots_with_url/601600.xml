<plot>As a force of light, angels are God's ministering spirits, messengers who protect and comfort, created for the purpose of carrying out the will of God. Serving as an intermediary between heaven and earth, angels pass through the invisible windows between the worlds. The Witnessing of Angels" features breathtaking eyewitness accounts of people who have seen and heard angels. These divine encounters with angels have brought with them a renewed sense that God is at work and that these angels among us are real. Join us on a spiritual journey of never before told stories of ordinary people's personal encounters with God's Messengers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?601600</url></doc>
