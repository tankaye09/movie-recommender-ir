<plot>A troubled man, John Patrick, is witness to a car crash and must decide whether or not to help save another man. In his mind if he saves the man he will receive accolades for his heroism. The most important person in his life, his son, will see him as a hero and his depressing workplace will surprise him with a promotion. His good deed does not go unnoticed but this quickly leads to a nightmarish twist, and his own downfall, as the world learns of his criminal past and the dangerous men he works for come back to take away everything that is most important to him. John's other option is to let the man trapped in the burning car die. In one moment one decision is made that will forever change the lives of these men.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?460863</url></doc>
