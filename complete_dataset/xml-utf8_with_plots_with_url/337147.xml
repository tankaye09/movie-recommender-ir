<plot>Lines in the Sand is a lyrical portrait of art and meditation. Using simple handmade tools Encinitas artist Kirk Van Allyn creates public art on the pacific shore. Beginning at low tide, the process of creation is the work of art. Using the beach as his canvas, the artist paints with the elements - sand, surf and light. Van Allyn creates a labyrinth, a sacred space. His body dances through time, leaving patterns of beauty in the sand. The tide doesn't wait; its return offers a fresh canvas for the morrow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337147</url></doc>
