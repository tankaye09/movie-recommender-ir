<plot>In this stop-action animation, a mournful bride sits alone on her wedding night wringing her hands. The wood floor is unadorned, the organ music sorrowful. The imposing groom enters the room, she shudders, and he strikes her. Later that night, she walks down the grand staircase of this large manor house, past family portraits of past generations: she notices that in each the mum is pale, the father dominant, his hands tight around the shoulders and necks of his children, and the children have no mouths. She turns and runs back to her room to find a way to set free herself and someone else: what is this life-affirming action?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380525</url></doc>
