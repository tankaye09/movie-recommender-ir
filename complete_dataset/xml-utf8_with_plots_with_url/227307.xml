<plot>A nine year old privileged American boy, Quinn, gets lost in the poorest country in the western hemisphere. He and his father are in Haiti on business when they get separated due to a car jack. Quinn must find his way to the only landmark he can make people understand--the Citadel, a castle-like fortress and local tourist attraction. He and his driver were to meet Quinn's father at The Citadel when he finished with a meeting. The Citadel is one of the landmarks Niya, the family's Haitian housekeeper, used to identify the way to get to her family's home-Quinn has a map that Niya drew for him. With help from kind Haitian people and drawing upon his courage and desire to get home, Quinn journeys through Haiti's beautiful countryside to find his father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227307</url></doc>
