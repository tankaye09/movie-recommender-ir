<plot>A beautiful picture, showing the arrival of a boat at Kiel, Germany, conveying Kaiser Wilhelm and Emperor Franz Josef. A fine, clear and easily recognized view of the two great monarchs, as they leave the boat and walk up the gang-plank which has been beautifully and artistically decorated for their reception. Emperor Franz Josef comes first and is warmly greeted by Prince Henry, of Prussia, who stands at the head of the gang-plank clad in the full dress of a German Admiral.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284508</url></doc>
