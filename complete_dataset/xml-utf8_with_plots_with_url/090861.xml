<plot>On March 18, 1978, an estimated crowd of 250,000 gathered at Ontario Motor Speedway to witness an all day festival brining together nine of the most popular hard rock acts at the time. They ranged from established hard rockers such as Aerosmith and Ted Nugent, the Latin sounds of Santana and up and coming acts in the form of Heart, Foreigner and Rubicon. This special is a condensed sampling of the events that occurred that day and not only shows many of the performers at their peak, but how the crowds were entertained between acts with skydivers as well as skateboarders performing on a very primitive half-pipe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090861</url></doc>
