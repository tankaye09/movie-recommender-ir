<plot>Patra (Ann Corio), the Sultan's daughter, has inherited all the oil lands of Araband following the death of her mother. The Sultan (Charles Butterworth) wants to sign them over to Rata (Jack La Rue) and Ludwig (Gene Stutenworth), German agents, but Patra says she will only sign them to Americans. Kuda (Fortunion Bonanova), the Sultan's right-hand man, actually in league with Rata and Ludwig, wishes to marry Patra, but she refuses. Patra and her best friend and teacher, an American named Irene (Irene Ryan), visit the city incognito, and there meet Americans Jimmy (Edward Norris) and Tim (Tim Ryan). Kuda hires them to talk Patra into signing over the oil leases to him and they, not knowing he is working for the Nazis, agree to try.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?594214</url></doc>
