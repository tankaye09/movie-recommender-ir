<plot>When Chan comes to Vancouver to be with his wife, he finds her sleeping with a local cop, as well as discovering that the deed to his house has been sold. Devastated, he wanders the streets, and is eventually helped by a no-nonsense woman who is the sister of Chan's high-school friend. The two start an odd romance, which is periodically interrupted by the ghost of Chan's friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661718</url></doc>
