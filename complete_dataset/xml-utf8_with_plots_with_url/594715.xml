<plot>Lance and Mina live a happy life together filled with romance, seduction, and irreplaceable memories. Like any young couple, Lance and Mina share the friendship of their best friend Joe. However, during their moments together, Joe falls in love for Mina and a secret love triangle arises. Lance grows suspicious and his jealousy drives Mina insane. As the original magic that brought them together goes away, the relationship falls apart, and Mina leaves Lance in a matter of desperation. The relationship is left without an absolution, and Lance's fears for an inevitable lonely future strike his present. Time passes, and Lance never sees or hears from Mina again. Between his loving memories with her and the painful reality that confronts him, his pain grows and becomes overwhelming. Now, between his daydreaming fantasies with Mina and his new relationship with Jessica, a woman he likes but doesn't love, he will have to choose either staying attached to Mina or moving on in life with his new girlfriend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?594715</url></doc>
