<plot>"School Without Walls" is a documentary feature film on the effect of Rishi Valley Institute for Educational Resources (RIVER) educational program in the State of Andhra Pradesh, India. It is at one and the same time, both an enchanted voyage and an onerous story. Little Ashwini and her friends from the village take the viewer by the hand and bring them into their homes and their school. This discovery of the villagers' everyday life reveals their rich tradition, colorful folklore, and music. The men have their own way of looking at life, and the changes taking place in their community as they gather to discuss and drink. In intimate moments, the women confide the plight of their situation, their work, their married life, and their children's education, wherein hope still reigns. The RIVER program was developed by the Rishi Valley School founded by Jiddu Krishnamurti. The presentation of the village, villagers and school is punctuated with quotes from the writings of J. Krishnamurti tying together his philosophy with how it is affects the lives and stories of those who live in its presence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?480816</url></doc>
