<plot>Mitch is a senior at Harvard with a serious girlfriend and a serious problem: the girlfriend is Cat, an English student headed to London after graduation; the problem is that Mitch hasn't told her parents yet that she's gay. She thinks about her family a lot: she takes photos of them, she makes home movies about them. She photographs herself dressed up to resemble her mother when her mother was her age. She's pals with her dad, close to her grandmother, and not so close to her mom. She'll be home at Thanksgiving and Christmas in up-scale Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and they are visiting her in Cambridge. She resolves to tell them. What will be their reaction?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435740</url></doc>
