<plot>This illustrates an old and time-honored joke, but it is very well done and very laughable. A nurse girl becomes interested in a park policeman, and forgets her charge. A tramp sneaks up, and steals the baby's bottle. He is rapidly devouring its contents when the policeman discovers him, and marches him off to jail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410821</url></doc>
