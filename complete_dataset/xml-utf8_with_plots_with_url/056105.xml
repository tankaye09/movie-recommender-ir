<plot>It is Christmas Day in Calcutta and David Dawson is off to celebrate it with his sweetheart, Nandini Shom. The meeting does not go well as Nandini wants him to start working so that they can get married and start a family, while David wants a career as a musician. She tells him that she will never see him again. Despondent, he returns to his rented apartment and is chided by his landlady, Lillian, who threatens to have him evicted as he has been delinquent in paying his rent for over a year now and will not permit him to party with his friends. To make matters worse, Raka, a dumb boy, tells him in sign language that he has just witnessed a murder in a barbershop and the killers are after him. David takes him to the police-station where he lodges a F.I.R. (First Information Report) on Raka's behalf. What David and Raka do not know is that this is going to be last sane moment in their lives, as soon the killers will be literally camping on their doorstep - demanding that David withdraw the F.I.R. or this may well be his last Christmas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?056105</url></doc>
