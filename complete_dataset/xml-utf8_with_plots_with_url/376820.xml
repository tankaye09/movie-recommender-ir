<plot>The series of pictures of the Indian dances secured under the direction of the Interior Department, of which this dance is the first, constitutes a most valuable record of the weird and unique ceremonies of the Moqui, Zuni, Navajo and Crow Indians. Many of these dances take place at very rare intervals; then for the most part they are guarded very jealously from the eye of the curious white man. They constitute in fact an essential feature of the region of the aborigines, and as such are conducted with great pomp and ceremony. In the Rain Dance of the Moquis, as shown in this picture, over a hundred Indians take part. They are arrayed in the most gorgeous trappings of their tribe. On their heads are enormous grotesque masks heavily decorated with eagles feathers. The chief warriors and medicine men of the tribe lead the dance and give the signals for the various changes of movements. In the background, in the shadow of the adobe houses sit the old men of the tribe beating time with their tom-toms and rattles. This picture, with the others in the series, put on in a theatre with appropriate music and effects, is most impressive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376820</url></doc>
