<plot>A boy feels that his father (Joaquín Cordero) doesn't pay him to much attention. He wants to take karate classes, but the father argues that the family income is very poor, the fifteen anniversary party of his older sister or the trip to Disneyland for his little brother, who always wear a mask to play. One day, the boy and his best friend steal an obscene toy from his father and lend it to one spoiled and rich school friend, who give them a porn magazine in exchange. Nevertheless, they lose the magazine and the other kid wont return them the toy. In the end, the boy makes a friendship with the rich one, trying to get the toy back, but he begins to enjoy all the kind of stuff that only rich families can afford. However, and accident occurs because of the pride of the rich kid, and this event will test the authentic friendship between our kid and his best friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?189545</url></doc>
