<plot>When Detroit auto worker Terrence Rawlings is suddenly laid off from his job at EM Motor Company, he &amp; his wife of seven years Bridget are caught off guard and must suddenly re-think their priorities. As weeks turn into months and no job prospects open up, Bridget, who is not willing to give up the material things they've become accustomed to, secretly hatches a plan to become a strip dancer to make some fast cash. She soon realizes she not only likes the money, but the lifestyle as well. When Terrence eventually finds out, he is confronted with a harsh reality about his marriage and as his anger consumes him, must make the critical choice to do the right thing in dealing with it -- or the very wrong thing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006619</url></doc>
