<plot>Sunil lives with his mom and sister in a middle-class dwelling in Delhi, India. He works for Chopra &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants. He comes across a beautiful woman posing for a painting, and thinks she is poor and needy, and gives her a tip. The woman's name is Anita, and both are attracted to each other. Sunil and Anita intend to marry, and Sunil even introduces Anita to his mom. One day when attending a party, Sunil is shocked to learn that Anita is a multi-millionaire. Stunned at this deception, he swears he will have nothing to do with her. When Anita attempts to sooth things over, Sunil does cool down. It is then he finds out that Anita's dad, who is serving time, had killed his father, and that Anita mother is still alive, after making her living as a former prostitute.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366357</url></doc>
