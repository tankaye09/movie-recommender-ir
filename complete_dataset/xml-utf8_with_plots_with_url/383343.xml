<plot>"My Best Friends Are Strangers," is a road trip documentary examining the modern phenomenon of online friendships. In an impersonal world MySpace has become the drug of choice for those who are tied to their keyboards and unhappy with the corporeal. Disjointed and fed up with the lack of tangibility in her life, Zoe, a popular blogger on MySpace, decides to venture out from behind her computer screen and travel across America to make physical contact with her tribe of on-line "friends." This film is a funny, surprising and compelling search for identity; a disturbing examination of the nature of intimacy in the cyber age.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383343</url></doc>
