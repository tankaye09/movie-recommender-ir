<plot>The carriage containing President Roosevelt draws up at the door and the new President alights and passes into the City Hall. Next comes the hearse containing the body of President McKinley escorted by the sailors and marines. It stops immediately in the foreground of the field of our lens. The casket is carefully and reverently removed from the hearse and carried on the shoulders of the sixteen stalwart sailors and marines into the City Hall, where it lay in state during the afternoon of September 15. The casket was beautifully decorated with flags and flowers and was within twenty feet of our camera.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046139</url></doc>
