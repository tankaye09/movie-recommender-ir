<plot>She has supermodel good looks and is on her way from Hamburg to the bright lights of New York. He's a slacker-seeming cabbie, cigarette in hand, reading a book about Ennio Morricone. He carries her suitcase into the Hamburg train station, but it proves better timing for him to take her in the taxi to the Frankfort airport than for her to take the train. On the trip to the airport, they share laughter, Morricone theme songs, and a Polaroid of the two of them that he divides, keeping her image for himself. Intercut with this road trip are scenes of her on a train, shaving her legs, reading USA Today, talking with a man in a suit, and him negotiating traffic: where are they headed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?140212</url></doc>
