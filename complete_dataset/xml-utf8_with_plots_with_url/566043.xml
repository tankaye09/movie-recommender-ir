<plot>The Immortal Beaver follows the resurrection of de Havilland Beaver, "Olivia," who has been resting quietly for years in the Arizona desert, adjacent to the infamous 'airplane bone yard' outside Tucson. Features exclusive interviews with Harrison Ford- a proud Beaver pilot and owner- as the film follows the compelling story of Olivia's rescue and restoration- celebrating the history of a remarkable aircraft. Since the 1940's, the de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver bush plane has redefined performance, versatility and toughness for modern utility aircraft. Its pilots flew deeper into Alaska's remote northern frontier than ever thought possible, fearlessly taking off from and landing on lakes and glaciers that were once considered too dangerous to navigate with an airplane. The plane's reputation grew to every continent, both poles and over 15 military and over 60 countries. Over sixty years later, demand requires that the remaining aircraft be hunted down- one by one- pulled from jungle crash sites, lake beds and museums to be resurrected, modernized and flown again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566043</url></doc>
