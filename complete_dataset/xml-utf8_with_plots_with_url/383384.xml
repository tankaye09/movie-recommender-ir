<plot>A teenage girl receives a letter on her sixteenth birthday only to find out she has been deceived by her mother about her biological father. This letter was written by her father shortly before his death and is based on a true story and actual letter. She discovers that he had tried desperately to see her for the majority of her life but her mother made it impossible, defying the courts, hiding and lying to her about everything concerning him. Despite all of this, love comes from beyond the grave to painfully heal the wounded.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383384</url></doc>
