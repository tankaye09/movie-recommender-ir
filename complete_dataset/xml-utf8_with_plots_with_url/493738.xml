Carolina, however, is in love with Max, her French teacher. Pinchas finds them making out and is furious and even more adamant that she marry soon. Reb Kalman finds Kuni Lemel as a possible match. It turns out that Max and Kuni are cousins and are identical, except that Kuni is blind in one eye, limps, and stutters. Max plans to act like Kuni so that Reb Pinchas will have his daughter marry Max by mistake.
