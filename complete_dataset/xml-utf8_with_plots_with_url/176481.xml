<plot>The Zapata Presents Film Saga is, at its heart, a story of revolution. Each chapter unfolds the epic telling, over four films, of a possible future in which a repressed people rise up to take control of the system that oppresses them. The story of the Mexican immigrant (illegal and otherwise) and the way in which our society, our corporations and indeed our very government has come to depend on him for blood, sweat and silence rings especially true in these tumultuous times. The Red Rover is the second of a four-part story, a fiction based in hard and sometimes tragic fact, in an unlikely place with unlikely faces. The revolution ultimately goes beyond the immigrant struggle, about the path of every man that has revolted against the system he helped build. A tale of mystery and mysticism as there are greater forces at work then just man, the time has come for revolution. The time has come for the story to be told!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176481</url></doc>
