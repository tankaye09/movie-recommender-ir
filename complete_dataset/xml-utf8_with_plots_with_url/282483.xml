<plot>Matt Wilton, a 10-year-old Eurasian boy, is having breakfast with his parents when they tell him that he must go and see his Grandpa because it's Grandpa's birthday. Matt isn't keen on the idea. Grandpa lives in the past and Matt doesn't understand him. Grandpa's so old-fashioned that he doesn't even own a computer. But Matt is a good boy and does his duty and when we finally meet Grandpa we discover that he's a real groovy geezer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282483</url></doc>
