<plot>Detox is the story of young man named Eric. Eric passes the time indulging in various narcotics, with seemingly no direction for his life. That all changes when his older brother Ian comes to him with a plan to rob a huge crime lord and retrieve a mysterious envelope. As the story progresses Ian's plan is uncovered by those in charge and his ambition leads him to his eventual death. Now Eric seeks out the help of a close family friend in order to quickly sober up and serve up some justice to those responsible for his brothers' murder. The film takes us on a journey along side Eric as he dissects the organized crime world to find those responsible for his brothers murder. We learn that Eric's addictions never disappear, but that his desire for drugs has now merely been replaced by the desire to kill. Throughout the story is the ongoing question: What is in the envelope? Everyone involved seems to place a large amount of importance on it, except Eric; he cares only about making those who have wronged him pay. Can Eric succeed in his quest, or is the power of the envelope and those controlling it too much for a recovering drug addict to handle? One thing is for sure, Eric doesn't care about the odds being stacked against him, after all, they always have been.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143038</url></doc>
