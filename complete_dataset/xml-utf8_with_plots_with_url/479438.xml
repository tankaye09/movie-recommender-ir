<plot>Two contestants, one a returning champion, competed in this classic series. The announcer described merchandise gifts; it was up to each contestant, one at a time, to select which items would help them get as close to a prescribed dollar limit without going over. The first contestant to go over loses the game and his accumulated prizes for that round (all other winnings are considered safe); however, a contestant could "freeze" or stop selecting items at any time if they feared the next item would make them exceed the limit. The contestant to win two rounds was champion; he/she competed until defeated. On occassion, a contestant could win between 1 and 100 cases of a certain product (e.g., five cases of motor oil; 100 cases of bottled Crush soda) to go along with a bigger prize (e.g., a new Cadillac Sedan DeVille 4 dr. hardtop; a Crush soda vending machine).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479438</url></doc>
