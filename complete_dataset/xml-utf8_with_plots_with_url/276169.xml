<plot>A poetic film that follows a season of an unusual open air swimming pool in Cambridge, England, through the work of artists who are inspired by it. Dormant over the winter, in the spring the pool is emptied, scrubbed, painted and filled with fresh water. An artist works patiently on his canvases. An elderly poet swims and then writes a poem as he rests on a poolside bench. A musician plays his guitar. A photographer makes a portrait of the pool. Singers give a charity concert. As the season draws to a close, leaves fall into the water, the temperature and finally the shutter is dropped for the last time. The pool dies, but will be re-born the next year.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276169</url></doc>
