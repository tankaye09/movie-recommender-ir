<plot>In 1996, the legalization of medical marijuana won by the citizens of California and the DEA has been at war with the clinics ever since. This is costing the tax payers of California millions of dollars each year. If it is legal, why are they raiding the medicinal clinics? Are they going to make the use of medical marijuana illegal or can they come up with a solution to make this practice work. It is about time that the tax payers of America learn what really is going on. Marijuana is not a dangerous drug. For years doctors and scientists have tried to show the government that the drug is safe. For people to better understand what marijuana is and Prop 215, Medicinal 101 is an educational documentary made to teach people the truth. We have interviewed doctors, lawyers, and activists with all having clear and solid evidence about the truth about marijuana.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363407</url></doc>
