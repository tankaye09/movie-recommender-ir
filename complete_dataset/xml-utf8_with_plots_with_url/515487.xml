<plot>This video was shot shortly before Steven Brown, who had lived for ten years in Brussels and previously for seven years in San Francisco, decided to move to Mexico where he still (as of 2002) resides. In this "farewell to Brussels" video, Steven Brown shows the places where he lived in Brussels, plays some music, alone or with Blaine Reininger, in a sunny and deserted city, and talks about Tuxedomoon, about himself as an expatriate wanderer and about his passion for cinema.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?515487</url></doc>
