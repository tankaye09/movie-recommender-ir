<plot>A Little from Left of Right takes a fascinating route to promote awareness of cannabis' essential place in our arsenal of medical treatments. Exploring a history going back to ancient cultures, the film recounts how cannabis was prevalent in American medical treatments until as late as the 1940s. The backlash against "marijuana" - the word is a thinly veiled racial epithet contrived by opponents - stemmed in large part from economic self-interest. The vanguard of the medical marijuana movement relates the inside story surrounding Californians passing Proposition 215 in 1996, ensuring the rights of the seriously ill to cannabis treatment despite daunting federal laws. We meet the people whose lives and health are impacted at a San Francisco holistic clinic. From societal bane to therapeutic remedy, cannabis' gradual hard-earned return is revealed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012512</url></doc>
