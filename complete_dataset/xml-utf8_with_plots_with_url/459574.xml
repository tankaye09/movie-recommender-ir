<plot>Claire and Audrey contemplate the seriousness of their relationships and the boys that they're involved with. Audrey dates Sean and Claire is in a relationship with Greg. Audrey has been best friends with Greg since high school and shares the most intimate secrets with him. She doesn't love Sean but likes him, wanting to end her relationship but not knowing how to do so. Claire disagrees with Greg's lifestyle because he smokes cigarettes. She forbids him because she doesn't date guys who 'do it.' Greg, feeling pressured and arrested in his relationship, decides to smoke in secret and hide his habit from his girlfriend. All of this culminates with a night of drinking where both relationships end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459574</url></doc>
