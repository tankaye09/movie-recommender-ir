<plot>It was a plane 20 years ahead of its time, scrapped by a government that was out of touch with the times. Now the Arrow once again takes to the air, if only on your TV. Compiled from rare colour film footage shot by Avro Aircraft this is a tribute to a great aircraft and to everyone who worked on it. See the Arrow from design through to its many test flights. Rare scenes include: design work, wind tunnel tests, model test flights, aircraft assembly, engine testing, and the Arrow's first flight. Beautiful shots of all five Arrows that were completed, and in the end, the Arrow's final destruction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052774</url></doc>
