<plot>A very fine circular panorama giving a most comprehensive view of Parisian streets and thoroughfares. A fine view of St. Michael's Bridge, and Notre Dame Cathedral is shown. Passing omnibuses, double deck electric and horse cars, and a fine avenue crowded with pedestrians and vehicles add great interest to the scene. A typical Paris picture, carefully planned, and giving a better idea of the city in one scene than a dozen street scenes made under old methods of animated photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422068</url></doc>
