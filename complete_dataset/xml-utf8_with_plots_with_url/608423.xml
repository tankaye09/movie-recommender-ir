<plot>A famous rock star dies in Toronto under suspicious circumstances. As his body is transported through the netherworld of the death industries, the deceased's questioning spirit speculates about the meaning of his life and the cause of his death. On his journey, he encounters the people who make their living where life ends-the person who delivers the body, the chief pathologist who performs this autopsy, the embalmer, and the hairstylist: and finally the creamatorium operator. His odyssey reveals a society that demands to be shielded from the reality of death. And the death industry workers who comply. Part documentary, part fiction, TIME IS ON MY SIDE contrasts the hard realities of death with the metaphysical questions that surround it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608423</url></doc>
