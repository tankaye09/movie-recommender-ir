<plot>Boxing bantam Pepe Chickeeto is continually bested in the boxing ring and considers retiring. Fortunately, he and his wife are expecting a son who, Pepe hopes, will carry on his great boxing legacy. He is quite disappointed when the son, Pepito by name, much prefers playing bongo drums to any kind of pugilism. Fortunately, his love for bongo playing comes in handy the night of his first big fight when a bucket lands on his opponent's hand and, using it as a bongo to practice on, knocks his opponent out and wins!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545151</url></doc>
