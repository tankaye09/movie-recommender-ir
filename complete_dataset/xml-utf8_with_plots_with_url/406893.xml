<plot>Set in late eighteenth century Japan, Ocha tells the story of a woman who anxiously awaits her fiancé on their wedding day. As she prepares a tea ceremony a messenger comes bearing bad news. Her fiancé, an officer in the Emperor's service, will not return. Filled with sorrow, she continues alone with the tea ceremony she had meant to share. Will Ume be able to survive without the man she loves? With luscious scenery and beautiful costumes it is hard not to get sucked in to Ume's life as she comes to terms with her loss.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406893</url></doc>
