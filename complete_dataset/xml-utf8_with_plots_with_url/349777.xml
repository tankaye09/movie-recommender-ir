<plot>Dibyo (Ringgo Agus Rahman) is a natural born loser whose fate changes one day when a pretty woman, Mira (Mulan Kwok), falls head over hells with him. Their romance goes too far, and Mira finds herself pregnant with Dibyo's child. Unfortunately, without Dibyo knowing, Mira is still legally bounded as a wife of Lamhot (Eddie Karsito), a big-time thug. Lamhot goes mad when he finds out about this, but he is smart enough to punish Dibyo in an unusual way: by forcing him to marry Lamhot's equally-stubborn younger sister, Butet (Shanty). Can Dibyo escape this hideous plan?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349777</url></doc>
