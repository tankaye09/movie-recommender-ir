<plot>The town of Rio Blanco is the center of a fight over the statehood issue and is a perfect setup for Lon Bryson (Roy Barcroft) and Chuck Bowers (Don Haggerty), who organize a couple of phony protection associations. Opposing them is Henry Waterman (Emmett Vogan), publisher of the Rio Blanco Herald. He and his assistant, Andrew Jackson Weems (Paul Hurst), send for the help of the Territorial Rangers. One of the dispatched Rangers is Jeff Lanning (Monte Hale) who, unknown to him, has a brother as a member of the gang under an assumed name of Bob Mitchell (Douglas Kennedy.) Jeff is so shocked at seeing his brother gun down Waterman that he is unable to act in time to prevent it. Unable to explain the cause of is inaction, he is suspended by the governor. Unable to persuade his brother to quit the gang, Jeff, with the aid of Weems and Waterman's daughter Carol (Kay Christopher), begins his quest to bring the outlaws to justice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?508498</url></doc>
