<plot>A tour through the history of the "King of the Air" event, the epicenter of the sport of kite boarding, held annually on the island of Maui, HI, and the sport of kite boarding itself, examining the progression of the event, technological advances and new crop athletes who are pushing the limits of what is possible in the sport of kite boarding and the impetus of kite boarding events taking place around the world today. Features archival footage from the very earliest attempts to merge performance kites and surf boards, wake boards and the ultimate development of specific kite boards. Also features the best of prior "King of the Air" shows, as well as previously unreleased footage. The show also showcases kite boarding pioneers telling it like it was and giving a unique perspective on a sport from its very inception through its explosive growth around the world as well as "new school" from an "old school" point of view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292578</url></doc>
