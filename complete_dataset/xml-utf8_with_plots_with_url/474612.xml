<plot>A New Zealand version of the US TV show of the same name. In this quiz/game show, contestants had to answer relatively simple questions on general knowledge categories. Correct answers earned the contestants a few dollars. The show's gimmick was that the contestants could then exchange some of their money for expensive prizes which would be offered at extreme discounts. The contestant who finished the show with the most cash could then return to compete in the next show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474612</url></doc>
