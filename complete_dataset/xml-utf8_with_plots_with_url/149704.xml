<plot>It is the story of a happy man who's been jailed only to dry out his drunkenness. But he's forgotten. Deep down in the basement of a local police station. It is the story of a sudden fight for survival. It happened just over night. Accidentally but merciless. There is no water. But a stove that slowly converts the room into a sauna. There is his wife reporting him missing ten feet above in the same local police station. He can even hear her through the old AC system. But he can't call her. His voice has dried out. From an ordinary man's life right into bare horror: an existentialistic thriller.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?149704</url></doc>
