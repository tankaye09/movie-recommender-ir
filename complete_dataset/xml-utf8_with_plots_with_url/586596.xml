<plot>The Return Of The Fabulous Seven is a high-caliber romp through the world of fashion. With a good splash of camp and a darkness tickling their collective underbelly, the characters in Fabuluos 7 weave a story that pokes fun at our contemporary obsession with surface beauty, examines what getting older is really all about, and questions the fabric of friendship and loyalty, all under the shadow of a past that proves to have a relentless and unforgiving grip.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586596</url></doc>
