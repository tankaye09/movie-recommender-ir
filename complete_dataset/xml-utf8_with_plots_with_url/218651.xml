<plot>"This is a companion picture to No. 960 [Meadowbrook Hunt]. It shows the members of the hunt galloping on their way to the meet, hearded by the pack of hounds, with the master of the hunt and the whippers in. The riders are followed by a large number of well-known society people riding in carriages. The composition of the scene is exceedingly artistic."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218651</url></doc>
