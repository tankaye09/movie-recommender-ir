<plot>Pennyman lives his life on the street. He has become known as Pennyman for his 25 year habit of connecting to people through pennies. Pennyman spreads a simple joy and collecting pennies is merely the catalyst. Each day Pennyman takes his pennies to his bank and lets them build - for what? '...Im gonna listen and follow...' and following takes him into the life of Darryl, a young man who has invested his peace of mind in the stock market. The day finally comes that the stock market crashes. Feeling like a failure, in both job and family, Darryl is ready to give up. The two men of different generations, vocations, and life purpose meet and what ensues can only be described as fate...or to some...Destiny!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?428223</url></doc>
