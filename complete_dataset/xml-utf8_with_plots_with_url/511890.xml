<plot>Od, a professional burglar from Thachalom, is married to Waew. The couple's life is fraught because of Od'slow sex drive, leaving Waew frequently ill-tempered. When a criminal dies in prison leaving a puzzle, the number "33/9" inscribed on the cell floor, Inspector Sansern instructs two sergeants to find an insider spy to investigate the mystery, and Od is nominated. Od accepts the job for fear of being arrested if he refuses, despite his wife's concerns about its potential bad effect on her career. When Inspector Sansern meets Od, the thief recognizes the cop as a cross-dresser he saw through a window, setting Od up for a bizarre time as the unwilling spy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511890</url></doc>
