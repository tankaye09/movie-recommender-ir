<plot>A brave Indian policeman named Raj beats up and then arrests a Muslim terrorist by the name of Khan. This gets him promoted, and he is congratulated by none other than his father-in-law, who is also a very high ranking policeman. Then all of a sudden, Raj finds out that many policemen would like to see Khan go free. He discusses this issue with his father-in-law, and to his surprise, does not find any support from him. Disagreements and arguments ensue, and as a result, his father-in-law gets killed. The Police suspect Raj of killing him, they begin the process of arresting him, he runs away, while Khan is all set to get freed to do whatever he likes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264271</url></doc>
