<plot>A Movie that can Save Lives - In the donor-fatigued, jargon-laden, taboo-filled world of HIV/AIDS, two innocent and innovative voices revive our understanding and compassion. By asking questions ("that only a child could ask"), two young girls get basic, honest, and fresh answers about the pandemic that defines our times. The result is a refreshing and thought-provoking documentary about our inability to make the epidemic understandable to all people because of our discomfort with issues of sex and sexuality. The fact that two kids can get to the bottom of it at the International AIDS Conference - talking to experts, sex-workers, cross-dressers and people living with AIDS - is hilarious, hopeful and a little bit haunting. Why have so many died because we can't talk about these subjects in an open and honest way?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435960</url></doc>
