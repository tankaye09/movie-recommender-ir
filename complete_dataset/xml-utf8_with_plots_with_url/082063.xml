<plot>Douglas is a hard working independent man who has made a great life for himself. This contrasts sharply with the life that his father lead. Douglas' father, Leonard was an often out of work writer who could not provide financial stability for Douglas as a child. Douglas is reflecting back on how he treated his father growing up and the disdain he felt for him not being a good provider. At first feeling justified about the way he acted in the past Douglas in the end questions whether he really knew his father at all, and if the man he often looked down upon wasn't really all that he seemed to be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082063</url></doc>
