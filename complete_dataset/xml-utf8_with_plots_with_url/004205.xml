<plot>1983. 5 AM. Wernyol, Sudan. Kuek Garang, six years old, grabbed by the collar, is shoved out the back of his grass hut. His terrified parents beg him to run for his life. Kuek ran. Then walked, along with 27,000 other Lost Boys of Sudan, thousands of miles. Thousands died. Hunger, disease, wild animals, militant marauders, and exhaustion claimed more lives each day. Kuek survived years in refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia. Then, 15 years later, the United States at the request of the UN High Commission on Refugees, granted Keuk asylum and moved him to Chicago. Now, at age 28, Kuek has discovered that his parents and family miraculously survived the civil war and are living in Sudan and Kenya. "22 Years from Home" is the story of Kuek's joyous and triumphant return to his home, to his family, to the one's he loves.</plot><plot>1983. 5 AM. Wernyol, Sudan.
