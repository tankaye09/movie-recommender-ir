<plot>Elnora Comstock (Marian Marsh) is the badly abused daughter of Katherine Comstock (Louise Dresser), who blames her because her father was drowned while on the way home the night she was born. She finds her comfort with Margaret (Helen Jerome Eddy) and Westley Sinton (Ralph Morgan), a childless neighboring couple, who help her with her school costs, as does the wealthy Mrs. Parker (Betty Blythe), who takes an interest in the talented young girl. She meets and falls in love with Phillip Ammon (Edward Nugent), the nephew of Dr. Ammon (Henry B. Walthall), but learns that he is already engaged. The money that Elnora has saved for her college education is stolen, and when Mrs. Comstock goes to retrieve it from a suspect, she also learns of the duplicity of her husband, who had been courting a neighboring woman on the night he drowned. She begs forgiveness of Elnora, and the romance of Elnora and Phillip also begins to flourish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010956</url></doc>
