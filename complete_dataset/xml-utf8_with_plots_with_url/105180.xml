<plot>He was kidnapped up north as summer was drawing to an end. A whole army went to war just to bring him back. He might still be alive. Yet, the day the war ended, he was still the Kidnapped, the Living Dead, the one who didn't return. "Chronicle of a Kidnap" depicts the laborious and Sisyphus attempt of his wife and his family to bring home he who was forgotten the very day the war ended. It is the story of a young woman, his wife, who wished "to bring him the moon" and who inadvertently became an inane pawn in international diplomatic and political stratagems within a Marathon's media representation of her, who like in "Chronicle of a Death Foretold" is destined to encounter death in the last act.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?105180</url></doc>
