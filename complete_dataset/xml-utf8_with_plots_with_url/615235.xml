<plot>What makes Notre Dame special? Those on the inside can't explain it and those on the outside can't understand it -Tradition Never Graduates bridges that gap to explain and understand Notre Dame football in an intimate look at America's favorite team. Tradition Never Graduates - lives the Notre Dame Football experience through a season, piecing together scenes with the team, Coach Charlie Weis, students, alum and 'subway' alum to capture the essence of Notre Dame. From the practice field to the sideline, from the student section to the reserve seats and from California to Massachusetts the focus is on any and everyone who touches or is touched by Notre Dame football and the finished product is an answer to why there is only one team who's relevance always matters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615235</url></doc>
