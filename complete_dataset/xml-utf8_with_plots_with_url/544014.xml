<plot>The Bike is a way of being, of moving, of gyrating, of ascending and of descending. A manner of transporting our systemic way of being through the welding to its structure by means of an absolute abstraction to all which crosses our path at that instant in time. The mere fact of riding the bike involves the acceptance, becoming at one with a secondary force capable of helping us to travel along the pathways, (internally and externally) of which the Routine cuts deep grooves upon life's surface. The mere fact of propelling the pedals signifies the assumption of its indispensability when confronting any individual initiative. That's why it is always available. Always. At the right time, at the right place, without fail, precise like a clock mechanism. That's where the Routine starts, the bike turns out to be necessary. And, hence, it shows up. For whoever and no-one. Being part of our lives. Of our Routine. And also of our more or less chromatic way of confronting it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544014</url></doc>
