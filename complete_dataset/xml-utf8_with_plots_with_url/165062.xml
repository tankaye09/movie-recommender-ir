<plot>Elton has either gone completely crazy or is on the verge of a mental collapse. He is unrecognizable to everyone he encounters. He has tied a guy to a tree in the mountains. He fails to go in to work on a very important day and then walks off on his boss. He declares his love for a girl that he knows is probably out of his league and to top it all off, he's doing all of this on a single day. He's grown tired of putting up with the betrayals of his loved one and has decided to take her lover hostage. He's tired of being Mr. Henry's right-hand man at the restaurant and he's tired of working beside a girl who's completely clueless about his strong feelings for her. Elton has obviously never behaved like a sociopath before because everyone around him seems perplexed by his behavior. He's just simply decided to live one day differently, even if it means getting locked up or killed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165062</url></doc>
