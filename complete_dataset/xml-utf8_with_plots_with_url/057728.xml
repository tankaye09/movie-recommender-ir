<plot>With a unique blend of traditional ballet steps and non-traditional music. Ballet Unchained includes 12 exercises at the barre and 14 in the center. These exercises are designed to fit into a compact space, such as a living room. Each exercise is demonstrated and danced, but the video format allows you to skip the demonstrations once you become familiar with the exercises.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057728</url></doc>
