<plot>Just when Holly's life seems to be going perfectly, Harry, her boss and secret lover, dumps and fires her on the same day. Emotionally crushed, she makes a dramatic decision to end her life, but her plan is interrupted by a vulgar intruder, Keith, who breaks into her apartment, ironically forcing her to postpone her suicidal endeavors. Keith soon learns that he's getting more than he bargained for when Holly cleverly manages to turn the tables on her would-be attacker. In the midst of this chaotic episode, two people who seem to have nothing in common suddenly find that not everything is as bad, or as good, as it seems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597433</url></doc>
