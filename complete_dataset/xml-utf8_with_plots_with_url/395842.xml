<plot>Night Cry "Night Cry" is a trilogy in the tradition of "Alfred Hitchcock's Presents" featuring the episodes "Prayer for the Dead," "Last Stop Before Home," and "Coming Soon to a Neighborhood Near You". "Night Cry" began as an original idea Francis Xavier, the show's creator and executive producer, came up with twenty years ago for a television series on modern day horror. "Prayer for the Dead" It started like so many missing person mysteries: a young wife out for a walk never to be seen again. Two detectives hear a tale of abomination, and one husband is praying for the truth. "Last Stop Before Home" A deputy sheriff, two teens, a little old man, and a massacre. Deputy Smallwood will have an encounter with Jersey Johnson and will soon find out that crime really doesn't pay... or, does it? "Coming Soon to a Neighborhood Near You" Any neighborhood can hold a deep and dark secret. To know the secrets of Mahogany Circle, you will never let your eyes off your kids again. Pray it doesn't happen in your neighborhood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?395842</url></doc>
