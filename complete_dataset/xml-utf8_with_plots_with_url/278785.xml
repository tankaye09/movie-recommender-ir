After being raised by Samurai and trained in martial arts, Johnny wanders the post apocalyptic world fighting oppression and injustice. But a new evil arises, a ruthless tyrant named Genghis Fong. He controls the world with an army of aquatic ninjas and henchman. After reluctantly joining 'The Rebellion,' Johnny begins his journey to defeat Genghis Fong, with the help of his Kung Fu expert sidekick "Jargon Legomax," his secretary "Pilot Virtuoso," and a beautiful samurai named 'Coral Snow.'
