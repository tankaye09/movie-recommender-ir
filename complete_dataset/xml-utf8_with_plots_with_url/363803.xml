<plot>Jon and Joanne Spinster have decided to call it quits after five years of marriage. They despise each other; in fact, they wish nothing but the worst for each other. The couple decides to go to their lawyer's office to pick up the divorce papers together. Not talking to each other the whole morning, or the whole ride there they successfully reach the office and take the papers to be filled out at home during their own time. On the way home, on a desolate country road, the couple begin to argue and as the argument begins to escalate so does the speed of the car. As they scream louder, the attention on the road becomes less and less, until suddenly they hit something. They quickly come to a stop. Panicked the couple drive off. After a few moments they realize that what they hit is still moving. Horrified and scared they decide to reverse back and complete the job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363803</url></doc>
