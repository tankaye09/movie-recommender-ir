<plot>Homeless women and women in desperate straits on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside found a safe haven when Bridge Housing for Women opened in 2001. This opening culminated a 20-year effort by neighborhood residents and activists to create a place where women could escape the dangers of the streets and get support to come off drugs and alcohol. The women who created the project and the women who call Bridge home tell their stories. Building Bridge grew out of the Simon Fraser University research project, Health &amp; Home, investigating the relationship between housing and the health of women in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086004</url></doc>
