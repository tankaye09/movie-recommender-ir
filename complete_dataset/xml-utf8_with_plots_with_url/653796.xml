<plot>Places in The Holy Land where Jesus journeyed are shown as narration by Richard Basehart tells the relevant facts associated with each site. Location shooting is complimented with paintings from "The Desire of the Ages" by Harry Anderson. Bethlehem and The Church of the Nativity are shown, as are various views of Nazareth as Christ's birth and childhood are explained. Fishermen along the shores of the Sea of Galilee seem much the same as they might have been two centuries ago as Jesus began his ministry. Several places in Jerusalem are visited, including the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives, and The Garden Tomb.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653796</url></doc>
