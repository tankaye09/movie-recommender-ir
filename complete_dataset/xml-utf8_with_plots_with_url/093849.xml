<plot>A successful young actor tries to prevent his best friend, an ex-con, from killing the abusive corrections officer he kidnapped. After Edgar was released from prison, Jason invited him to stay at his home like any good friend would. The last thing he expected was to walk in on him torturing a stranger in his garage. Edgar wants the man dead, forcing Jason to make the toughest decision he's ever had to face. He can jeopardize his career and the life of his friend by turning him over to the police or he can become an accomplice to murder.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093849</url></doc>
