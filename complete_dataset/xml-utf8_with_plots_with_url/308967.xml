<plot>A large vase appears in the centre of the stage, and while it is being admired by a rather aged gentleman is suddenly transformed into a pretty girl. She comes down from the stand on which she appears and begins to dance for the old man. She then rises mysteriously in the air and performs graceful evolutions without any visible means of support. After a marvelous performance she slowly fades away from view. A tableau is then formed by a number of girls. The old man looks on with admiration and agreeable surprise. Any audience that sees this film projected will receive a treat similar to his.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?308967</url></doc>
