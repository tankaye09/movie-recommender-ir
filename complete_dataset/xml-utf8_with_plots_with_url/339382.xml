<plot>Boy George has been away from the music scene for 10 years, and this fly on the wall documentary follows him in the early days of his latest tour and deals with possible visa problems with the American leg of the tour. Living With Boy George not only explores George's world famous success as a musician, songwriter and DJ, it also captures him in his day-to-day life as he juggles his many other business ventures including his fashion store and label, organic food shop and his thriving career as a performance artist, photographer and an artist. This one-off special captures the real Boy George as he goes about his everyday life, and makes his return to the stage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339382</url></doc>
