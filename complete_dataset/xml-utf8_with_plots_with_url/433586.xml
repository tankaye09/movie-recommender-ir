<plot>Santa Dolores is a small western town that is a haven for outlaws and is ruled with an iron hand by Bruce Burnett (Damian O'Flynn) who extracts large sums for protection from the law. Harvey Masters (Ray Walker), a Kansas City policeman disguised as a perfume salesman, comes to town looking for the killer of his brother but is shot down in cold blood by Burnett's henchman Clip Pearson (Roy Barcroft.) Ted Post (Monte Hale), posing as a cattle broker but really a Dallas Marshal on the trail of an embezzler of cattleman's association funds, gets close scrutiny from the Pearson, but manages to pass himself off as an escaped killer. Ted contacts Huck Homer (Paul Hurst), a reformed petty-thief who now owns a locksmith shop. Huck is aware of Ted's true identity but can be trusted not to reveal it. Ted finds that the object of his search, Larry Forester (Myron Healey), and his sister Susan (Nan Leslie) are in the town, and Susan has been trying to get Larry to return to Dallas and face the charges. Ted finds evidence he needs against Larry and arrests him, but when Larry says that Burnett will force Susan to pay dearly for the loss of the money from his safe, Ted decides to go back and rescue the girl.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433586</url></doc>
