<plot>"STD: Sexually Transmitted Demons" is a film about a virgin female, wounded by a failed relationship, who grows pessimistic about the idea of allowing God to bring her a mate after finding that her ex has gotten engaged. Motivated by faithlessness and a strong desire to simply enjoy the company of a man, she accepts an "innocent" date with a playboy who privately struggles with sexual perversion. Being deceived by his charm, she makes a decision to "do what it takes" to hold on to this simulation of a loving relationship. Shortly after, she realizes that forgiving herself is merely one of the struggles she will face as she walks the road to redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472503</url></doc>
