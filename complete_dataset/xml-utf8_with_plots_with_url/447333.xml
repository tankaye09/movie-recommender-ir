<plot>Psycho Pinball is a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game. The game features include an animated back-glass display, multiple bonuses including a multi-ball, extra ball and background music that changes based on active specials. There are three main tables: The Abyss (Aquatic theme), Trick or Treat (Horror theme) and Wild West (Western theme). But an additional gimmick is a fourth Psycho Pinball table (circus theme) that has bonuses that can launch you to the other three tables, leading to massively high scores (and very long gameplay times).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?447333</url></doc>
