<plot>Happy Hooligan enters through a window, and to his great satisfaction, finds a table lavishly spread and immediately sits down to make a hearty meal, not forgetting to pay plenty of attention to the wine with which the spread is liberally garnished. He eats and drinks and replenishes the inner man, after which he falls asleep and it becomes apparent that a monkey has been carefully observing his actions through the window. Mr. Monk descends to the table and faithfully copies Hooligan's performance, not forgetting a due share of the drink. He then proceeds on a tour of discovery and coming across Hooligan endeavors to assist him in making his toilet more complete.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622996</url></doc>
