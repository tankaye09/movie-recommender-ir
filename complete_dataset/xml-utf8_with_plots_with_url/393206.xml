<plot>It's 1947 and private investigator Nero Bloom is about to experience his most twisted mystery yet! When hired by a rich socialite to secretly follow and protect her gambling husband, Charlie Lomax, Nero has no idea what mix of mystery and intrigue lay ahead. While the case seems to be "business as usual" at first, things quickly take a turn for the worse when Nero catches Charlie sneaking off to a secret love-nest rendezvous at a local hotel. Before you can say "whodunit," Charlie winds up dead in the hotel elevator and, with no other witnesses to the crime, Nero becomes the Chief of Police's prime suspect. Fired by Mrs. Lomax and his reputation tainted, Nero has little time to clear his name and find Charlie's real killer. With the help of friend and news reporter Max Cohen, Nero sets off to question anyone who could possibly be a suspect. There's the rotund and shady nightclub owner Oswald Finch, his meek assistant Stephen Trotter, the dazzlingly beautiful Veronica Saint Claire, and the eye-patched bodyguard known as Brute. Armed only with his revolver and wits, Nero must discover who killed the gambler in the elevator before he's the one behind bars.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393206</url></doc>
