<plot>In the mundane routine of life, couples often take each other for granted. This sometimes leads to couples spending more time bickering at one another than being kind. Or is the bickering another way we say I love you? Edward Bradshaw, a successful 33 year old businessman is mourning the loss of his wife, Lindsay. He keeps having vivid flashbacks of Lindsay. The flashbacks are her nagging at him. He starts to question what love truly is. Through his forlorn feelings Edward searches for an answer we all have asked. What is love? And to remember sometimes being told to take out the trash should be rebuttal with, I love you too.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200875</url></doc>
