<plot>The plot is set in two historical epochs, 1735 and 1935. The spirited Miss Queen (Khote), performing ina period play, recalls a previous incarnation when she was the actual person she is now acting on the stage. She inherited the throne because the state of Ranigarh had no constitutional heirs and her horoscope was deemed auspicious. Instead of being merely a figurehead, she opposes the corrupt minster Jairaj and army commander Mubarak (Pahelwan), she makes sure the royal court is accessible to the suffering people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275180</url></doc>
