<plot>A pretty wood scene. Two charming Summer girls are sitting in a hammock eating caramels. In the distance a farmer is mowing. Suddenly Happy Hooliday appears. He executes a war dance on seeing the two Summer girls alone, and stealing up behind them places an arm around each waist. The girls beat a hasty retreat, and Hooligan lies down in the hammock, blowing out clouds of smoke, The farmer has seen the occurrence, and comes with rapid strides. Reaching the hammock, he draws the scythe across the ropes and Hooligan hits the ground with a bump.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245188</url></doc>
