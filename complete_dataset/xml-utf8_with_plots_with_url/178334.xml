<plot>It's been 17 minutes and Natalie is becoming impatient. Gregory is still thinking about his next chess move and he needs his time, because Natalie made an excellent move with her knight. Gregory must almost certainly surrender his rook. When Gregory still hesitates about what to do, Natalie starts thinking about deaths of famous chess players and her own. Meanwhile Gregory is having his own thoughts. He could have won this game, if only he wasn't distracted by her attractiveness. How will he save his face?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178334</url></doc>
