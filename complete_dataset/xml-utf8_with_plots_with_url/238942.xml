<plot>Everyone's heard of the harried father who warns his wayward son, "If you don't straighten up, you're going to military school!" As his mother gasps in horror and his little brother grins with glee, the teenage scamp in question most probably will clean up his act - fast. That is, if this little scene takes place in the good old USA. But far, far away, in the city of Luhansk, Ukraine, the subject of military school plays out as quite a different story. Here, backed by centuries of time-honored tradition, a youngster will rally to the call of military school. He'll be proud to have been chosen, because so few are. He'll come to the Ukrainian Military Lyceum, the exemplary institution of learning, already a boy of good standing. He'll also wish to excel further, both academically and physically. Here, along with his new comrades in the Ukrainian military prep school, he'll accomplish that and much more. Together, they'll learn to work as one unit - shouldering the duties and responsibilities of young men and soldiers of tomorrow, but for now, they'll proudly be known as HIGH SCHOOL CADETS</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238942</url></doc>
