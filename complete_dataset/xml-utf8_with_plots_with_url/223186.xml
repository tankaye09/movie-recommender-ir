<plot>Jamie, a thirty-something actor concerned that his chance of hitting the big time may have already passed, is on the verge of quitting the business for good. He is gently coerced by his best friend, Oscar, into joining him to go to the country for the summer on the promise of a juicy role in a low budget horror film. He vows to both his girlfriend, Alex, and to himself that this will be his very last acting job. Jamie puts his life on hold to escape the relative safety of the big city, only to quickly discover that the role Oscar had in mind for him was not quite what he was expecting. Upon meeting the film's kooky director, Kelly, he also discovers a kindred spirit who begins to turn his attention away from his suddenly very needy girlfriend back in London.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?223186</url></doc>
