<plot>Ted would start with NOTHING. No water, food, sunblock, or supplies of any kind. The location was a 50x80 foot perimeter at the annual festival known as Burning Man in the harsh Black Rock Desert of northern Nevada. He would rely entirely on donations from strangers to make it through the week. All participants at the event must "come totally prepared for survival in a harsh desert environment." Nothing Without You turns this mantra on it's head while, ironically, highlighting the greatest strength of Burning Man; the generosity of its people. Bold, uplifting, humorous and inspiring.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401498</url></doc>
