<plot>Although Carla and Patrick have a very loving marriage, Patrick is a bit of a control freak and doesn't want his wife talking to other men. When a beach bum spies Carla reading a magazine on the deck of their beach front home, he climbs up and refuses to leave until she gives him a kiss. She protests that her husband will be home soon, and he has to leave, to no avail. Eventually she decides to give him the kiss if it will get him off her deck, but he grabs her in a passionate embrace just as Patrick arrives to witness. Patrick flies into a rage, and their relationship goes quickly downhill from this point. While Patrick is off giving a flying lesson, Carla leaves her ring on the pillow, and goes to stay with her sister Isabelle and her husband, Andrew in Sydney. Needless to say, Patrick is not pleased when he returns to find Carla gone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559376</url></doc>
