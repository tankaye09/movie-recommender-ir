<plot>A heartwarming and inspirational documentary which traces a medical doctor's journey through the spectrum of Autism after his son is diagnosed with the condition. In an effort to understand how to best help his son, Dr. Ali Shehata interviews other families struggling with the children on the Autistic Spectrum, medical doctors, ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) therapists and other specialists in the field of Autism care. The primary focus of the documentary is to give hope to those families struggling to cope with Autistic children as well as to help the viewer who has no contact with Autism to understand the warning signs of this serious condition to help with early intervention.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366798</url></doc>
