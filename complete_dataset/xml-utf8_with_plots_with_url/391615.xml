<plot>Q TV's ace reporter, Shivajirao Gaekwad, gets a chance for being the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, albeit for a day, after being challenged by Balraj Chauhan, Chief Minister himself. Shivaji accepts the challenge, and takes over the job, assisted by cunning personal assistant, Bansal. He comes across close of 46000 corrupt officials still employed with the State, and orders their suspension; he tours the city and surrounding areas, and makes sweeping changes, including the arrests of 12 ministers, and Balraj himself, and thus Shivajirao gets unpopular with people in power. After the day is over, Shivaji attempts to get back to his normal life as a TV reporter, but finds out that that one day has not only changed his entire life, but has put the life of his near and dear ones, in jeopardy. Shivaji will now have to decide whether to re-locate to a distant land, or continue exposing his near and dear ones to danger and certain death, in a State that considers "honesty" a liability.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391615</url></doc>
