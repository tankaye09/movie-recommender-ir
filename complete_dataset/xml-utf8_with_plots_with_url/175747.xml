<plot>Ellis Parks is both a Second Lieutenant in the North Carolina National Guard and a first through third grade classroom teacher in a charter school in North Carolina. He is recently married and his wife is with child. Despite the fact he has been promoted to assistant director of the school and has a good job where the children truly love him, he chooses to fight if needed for our government and country. The children are candidly asked some discussion questions about war, our war with Iraq, why we would go to war, how war can be prevented and how else to focus our efforts. Their answers and point of view are both deeper than expected and stunning. One kid is all for war but this idea has roots uncovered from a place you might actually expect in this day and age. Another child is quite a composed statesman despite his age and Washington could take pointers from him. We are a nation in flux.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175747</url></doc>
