<plot>Coming to the big city of Toronto, from a small village in India, has been quite a culture shock for Raju. Only a few days later, his cousin tells him to 'stop praying and start dating.' His cousin sets him up on a date with a girl who is 'just perfect for him' and Raju reluctantly agrees. Although Raju has never been a on a date before, he does what he can to get ready for the big event. When he arrives and meets the girl, he finds that she is not at all what he expected and a little more than he can handle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454519</url></doc>
