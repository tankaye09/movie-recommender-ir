<plot>Thicker Than Water is a story about blood ties; their creation through love, their obligations, and the conflict that results when they come undone. The story starts with Jonathan, a young man on a trip to deliver important news to his estranged alcoholic father Frank, whom he has not seen in over five years. From there the story constricts. Jonathan's long harbored ill feeling and anger act as catalyst to the days events. The tension, as with everything, is massaged through some hard drinks, and the two get down to business. When two people are connected by something thicker than water, there is no such thing as a hole too deep, or a wound too bloody. In the end, there will always be a little bit of light, and a little bit of healing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604131</url></doc>
