<plot>Here we present a faithful illustration of the beautiful sacred song by Clarence Hunt, "Ora Pro Nobis." The entrance of a beautiful church forms the background of the picture. The scene opens with the congregation passing into the church, and a very heavy snow storm prevails. It is night and the lights of the church stream out over the snow clad yard. Against a snow covered gravestone a young girl dressed in rags is resting, her face depicting want, care and weariness. A beautifully costumed lady, passing into the church, pauses long enough to speak a comforting word to the waif and passes her a coin. The child, however, is evidently past the point where she is interested in money and drags herself to the church door and listens to the music, her face beaming with evident delight. Weakened by cold and exposure, she totters toward a cross on one of the graves, at which she prays, and falls exhausted in the snow. The sexton and some of the congregation discover the body of the dead girl. Here a most beautiful and appealing effect is introduced. The angel of death hovers near and is seen to take the girl's departing spirit, which assumes the thin outline of her body and slowly ascends to the sky.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415006</url></doc>
