<plot>Jane has spent her life caring for her invalid mother in their rural home. Now middle-aged Jane finds herself with nothing to show for her life. Meek and mild mannered Jane is surprised one day by a visit from an unexpected guest, Mary-Sue, a loud Southern Blonde eager to speak with Jane's mother. With some reluctance Jane lets her into her home only to find that Mary-Sue has been negotiating a deal with Jane's mother to sell the home. Jane is adamant that her mother has no interest in selling, but Mary-Sue's persistence only serves to lead her into a trap that she never expected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184414</url></doc>
