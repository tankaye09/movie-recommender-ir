<plot>Shyam and Kamal are two school-going students who are close friends. When Kamal is unable to pay his exam fees, Shyam assists him, and as a result Kamal does well, is able to study further, becomes an IPS Officer, and is subsequently hired as the Superintendent of Police in Delhi, while Shyam re-locates to live in Bombay. Years later, Shyam has taken to crime in a big way and is now known as Rajeshwar. He kills a politician, S.M. Dayal, who had molested and killed, Geeta, his betrothed, but the Police are unable to find evidence to arrest him. They request Kamal to intervene and arrest Rajeshwar, and as a result, Kamal, along with his wife, Shashi, and sister, Sudha, re-locate to Bombay. Kamal finds out that Rajeshwar is none other than Shyam, but does eventually arrest him for abducting and sexually molesting Shama. Shyam believes that the charges against him are false and trusts Kamal fully. But the Court finds Shyam guilty, and sentences him to seven years in jail. Betrayed and upset with Kamal, an embittered and vengeful Shyam is discharged from prison after his sentence, determined to molest Sudha and make Kamal's life a nightmare.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?450325</url></doc>
