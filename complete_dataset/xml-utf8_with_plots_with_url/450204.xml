<plot>Ridiculed by project bullies, "midget" Quenton Wilson grew into a six foot basketball maverick by age fourteen. When he first stepped his size twelve shoe upon the court as a freshman, legendary Kingston High School coach, David Jordan, knew he had just witnessed the most talented basketball player in school history. Coupled with his mother's efforts and the mentorship of Coach Jordan, Q became a young man of impeccable character and the number one player in the nation. This accomplishment none of the other great players coming out of the Windy City had ever achieved. During a break at school, Q and his girlfriend Wanda were off campus, when Q accidentally bumped into a young man on the sidewalk. Words were exchanged, and then a gun was drawn. POP, POP, POP, the shots were aimed at the heart and liver. Seventeen hours later, the buzzer sounded at the hospital but there was no overtime and the game was over. Number 25- Quenton Wilson was gone, his basketball future was no more. But the memory of Q lives on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?450204</url></doc>
