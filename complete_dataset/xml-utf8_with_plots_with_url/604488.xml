<plot>Jack and Beatrice meet and fall in love, but Beatrice's father objects, because Jack's family is wealthy, and Jack has never had to work for a living. He makes Jack sign an agreement that he will make a living with his own hands for thirty days, to prove himself, before he sees Beatrice again. Jack's first attempts at manual labor are failures, but he finally finds an unusual job at a restaurant that gives him hope of fulfilling the agreement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604488</url></doc>
