<plot>"Venezuela: Revolution in Progress" gives unique insight into the forces that almost unseated President Hugo Chavez in a recall election during the summer of 2004. In Venezuela truth becomes a relative term as an increasingly polarized population grapples with Chavez and his agenda. Chavez promises a revolution that will redistribute the country's oil wealth to the poor, and uses the history of the United States' complicated relationship with Venezuela and South America to rally support to his side. "Venezuela: Revolution in Progress" is at once the story of democracy - Venezuelan-style, and a snapshot of the unraveling of U.S. foreign policy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?637578</url></doc>
