<plot>Idol Mind follows the personal account of Musa Jebak, a 19-year-old photography student from London and the consequences he has experienced after he was arrested over a knife-crime. Some years after his arrest and Musa is arriving at an important stage in life. Soon he will be expected to make decisions on things such as further education, what kind of career he may want to pursue, and how he will go about achieving his aims. But among these pressures exists a lingering dilemma - since Musa's arrest his father stopped speaking to him. Living with his mother, father and younger brother since the arrest hasn't been easy, however Musa has clung to the hope that if he does well at college his father may speak with him again. Challenged then with the events of his past and the invasion of new pressures, Musa shares with us in his own words a redemptive tale that inevitably holds a mirror to what it means to be a teenager, coming-of-age in London.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256409</url></doc>
