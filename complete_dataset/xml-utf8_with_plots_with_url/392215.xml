<plot>The Camera cuts to two brothers (Dagwood and Nigel) walking through the snowy northern Ontario wilderness. They have been lost for 3 days, have had no water or food. During the night one brother freezes to death. When morning comes, Dagwood attempts to wake his brother, there is no reaction, Nigel is dead. Dagwood tries to carry his brother's corpse out of the forest. He comes to his senses and understands his brother's fate, and what will be his as well, if he doesn't act. Dying of hunger he begins to eat his brother, Nigel. The curse of the Wendigo is visited upon him and Dagwood must crave human flesh for the rest of eternity. Now fast forward to a century later, six high school students decide to do a documentary / re-enactment of the Hayes brothers/Wendigo myth for their final film project. The six are polar opposites and have been put together as a group for the project by their teacher. The six leave for a weekend in Millcreek, Becca's mother's old town. After they arrive, almost immediately, they are fighting for their lives. Who's Who? What's What? Nothing is as it appears to be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392215</url></doc>
