<plot>Best known for bringing Subaru and Yugo to North America, and for producing the first sports car with gull-wing doors, Malcolm Bricklin has lost and regained millions, failing as often as thriving. But Malcolm is a man who gauges success by the experience itself, not just by the dollars and cents it generates. Filmmaker Jonathan Bricklin follows his father's last grasp at power before his last gasp, as dad dreams of being the first to distribute Chinese cars in North America. All he needs is a near-bankrupt factory and some investors. You wouldn't actually think Malcolm could do it, given his insistence that everyone conform to his ideas and his blustery, ostentatious, and unprofessional conduct. Can this showman transform his talk into reality? The Entrepreneur is a testament to Bricklin senior's legacy, a roller coaster ride through the ups and downs of brokering the blockbuster deal of a lifetime</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555560</url></doc>
