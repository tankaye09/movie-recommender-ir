<plot>We unhesitatingly offer this as the greatest marine picture ever made. It was secured by special concessions, on September 6th, 1902, and shows the fastest steam yacht in the world, Charles R. Flint's "Arrow" making a world's record one-mile run on the Hudson River, near Irvington. The yacht was photographed during her entire run over the mile course. She first appears as a small speck on the horizon, but quickly grows to a full sized craft, plowing through the water at the rate of nearly a mile a minute.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617739</url></doc>
