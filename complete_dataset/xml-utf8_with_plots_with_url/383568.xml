<plot>For single parent Ralph, how he's seen through his 7-year-old son's eyes means the world. In his own eyes, he's a failed artist working as a house painter - the perfect model for his son of what not to become. Little does he know, Zack's been developing his very own talent in art - putting him on a track to be just like his father. When Zack's class participates in "Take-Your-Kid's-To-Work" Day, Ralph must come to a difficult decision: Keep his job a secret or show his son the reality of what this career path may lead to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383568</url></doc>
