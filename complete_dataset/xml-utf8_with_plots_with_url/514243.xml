<plot>The year is 2420. Captain Johnny Taylor is the young and dashing leader of the Starslyderz - The United Planets of America's intergalactic crime fighting force! Aided by his trusty crew, Captain Taylor will scour the furthest reaches of the galaxy in pursuit of his arch nemesis: the evil Gorgon! A criminal mastermind hell-bent on bringing America to its knees, Gorgon and his loyal servant General Mortikai will stop at absolutely nothing in their pursuit of Enerjinn - the magical power source that fuels the galaxy! Years ago, when Johnny Taylor was just a boy, his father, Captain Jason Taylor, was the heroic leader of the first-ever Starslyderz brigade. With the help of three talented teenagers, Jason Taylor zipped through the galaxy fighting for freedom and justice, foiling the evil schemes of Gorgon time and again. But then a mysterious and powerful stranger joined the Starslyderz, an angry green alien called... The Mighty Mortikai! By the time the Slyderz realized that something was amiss, it was too late. Gorgon and Mortikai blasted them into oblivion, leaving the young Johnny to go on alone and strive to fill his father's massive space boots. Now in charge of patrolling the galaxy's outer limits, Captain Johnny Taylor is contacted by the President and given the mission he's been waiting for: Gorgon has kidnapped the President's beloved daughter, Princess Genivieve! Captain Taylor's desperate hunt for Gorgon will take him on a magical, musical voyage through time, space, and the depths of the human heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514243</url></doc>
