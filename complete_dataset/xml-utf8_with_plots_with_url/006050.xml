<plot>Danny Decanter has never held a job or accepted any amount of responsibility. At 25, he still dates high school girls, borrows his Dad's car, gets breakfast delivered in bed by his Mom, watches Saturday morning cartoons, and receives a $50 allowance. Today, however, Danny's father gives him an ultimatum: fend for yourself or leave the house. Throughout a day-long journey, Danny meets a series of characters - each with a different life lesson to present. And Danny's first comical encounter with the girl of his dreams makes the impossible possible.</plot><plot>Danny Decanter has never held a job or accepted any amount of responsibility.
