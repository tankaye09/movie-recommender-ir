<plot>An honest, colorful, sometimes bitter comedy about the frustrations of owning your own business. C.B.D.: The Comic Book Diaries is the story of John Burns and Pete Reynoso. Two owners of a struggling comic book store where nothing at all seems to sell, relationships end in the worst possible manner, employees are fired for smoking pot behind the store, shoplifters are abused before being set free and even the artists are quite literally dying. Has financial salvation for John and Pete arrived at last in the form of out-of work, has been, comic book artist Nick Levine? Will Nick's latest independent comic, entitled "Wargasm", finally put his career back on the right track? How much can Pete really charge people for the comic book of a now deceased, once famous artist? Anyone who has ever worked in retail, hung out in a comic book store, owned their own business, or seen their once loved hobby turned upside down in the name of commercialism will empathize with John and Pete's uphill battle to remain friends and somehow keep their business afloat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089419</url></doc>
