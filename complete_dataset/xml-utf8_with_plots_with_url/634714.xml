<plot>Product Description For the first time ever, the complete history of Bay Area Thrash Legends VIO-LENCE. Presented in a 90 minute documentary and directed by TALES FROM THE PIT creator, Jerry Allen, BLOOD AND DIRT takes you on a trip of bad attitudes, bloody knuckles and brutal music. From their early DEATH PENALTY days to the infamous Centennial Hall Riot to Thrash of the Titans to their last show at The Pound SF in 2003, it's all here. See interviews with all members of Vio as well as commentary by fans, friends, journalists and their thrash brothers, EXODUS, TESTAMENT, FORBIDDEN and DEATH ANGEL. Witness ultra rare video footage shot by the band themselves as well as live clips from different eras of their short but legendary history. Also included is a bonus disc, featuring their crushing THRASH OF THE TITANS performance as songs from their sold out Slim's show and more....</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?634714</url></doc>
