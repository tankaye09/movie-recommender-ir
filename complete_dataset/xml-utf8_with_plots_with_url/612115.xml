<plot>A group of friends who are spending their last day together after graduation, before they go off in separate directions in life, find that life can come quicker then any of them could ever imagine. Beth is packing to move to Los Angeles but promised, her overbearing best friend, Ginny that she would come over and help her set-up for one last "end of summer" bash. What she didn't expect was to find their friendship getting put to the test. Their friend Todd is also preparing to leave but he is off to the Marines. On his way over to the party he sees the girl of his dreams and decides that he can't leave without finding out her name. Meanwhile, Stewart, Ginny's little brother, tries to fit in with the popular crowd but when he gets his opportunity to prove himself, he has to decide to either step up or step aside. And Tracy, who has been kept in the dark by all of her friends about an obvious secret, discovers something that will change the lives of her and the people she cares about the most, forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612115</url></doc>
