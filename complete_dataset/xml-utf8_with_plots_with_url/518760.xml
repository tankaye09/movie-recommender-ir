<plot>What started out as a "Making of..." video, turned into a Documentary over time. "Strong Enough To Break" tells the story of Isaac, Taylor, and Zac Hanson's 3 year struggle with their record label to make an album, THEIR way.It also gives an inside look at how major record companies do business. After many unproductive years, Hanson cut ties with Island Records in April 2003, which lead to the launch of their own company, 3CG Records, and a highly successful Acoustic Tour that paved the way to what would become one of the most successful self-released albums of all time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518760</url></doc>
