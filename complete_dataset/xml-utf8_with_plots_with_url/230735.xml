<plot>When he was born it was immediately obvious that Harold was no ordinary pig. The fact that he was inflatable was one thing but the ambition he had was what made him stand out. After a few years on the farm as an outsider he just left and wound up with a circus, helping out with odd jobs. And then, one night, when the main act fell sick (and fell on top of his act - the fleas) Harold steps up. Fitting his whole body into a jam jar, Harold becomes famous. However with fame comes pressure and nobody stays at the top forever. This documentary looks back at his career, from the perspective of those that knew him best.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230735</url></doc>
