<plot>Deep within the farmland of Northwest Ohio, there exists a place for some, where time no longer travels in a straight line. Fenced off, guarded, and currently under the watchful eye of NASA, this 6,000 acre stretch of land has factored into national policy for over 200 years. Join host, Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway of the Star Trek Voyager series) as she tells the true story of the thousands of men and women who have been called to these so-called "Firelands." Hear firsthand from the former staff of the NASA Plum Brook Reactor Facility as they relive their brief, but innovative, stay on this land. Walk with them as they return for the first time to the very heart of the facility they once manned, a technological marvel that has remained frozen in time for over 30 years. Stand with them as their onetime jewel of a facility is turned to dust, renewing the centuries-long cycle of proud beginnings, hard work, and sudden endings that have come to define this story, a story "Of Ashes and Atoms."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407468</url></doc>
