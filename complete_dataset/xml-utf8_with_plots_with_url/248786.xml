<plot>A man with pipe and smoking jacket relaxes in his easy chair as he listens to a football game on the radio. The announcer wishes everyone was with him at the stadium. With that, the fan at home dreams of a recent trip to the stadium to watch a game with his date. They enter the wrong gate and must fight the crowd to find their seats. There they are bothered by a loud fan, an inebriated one, and other interruptions. His date also asks him a series of questions about the game, suggesting she's not sure where she is. The comments of the excited announcer continue as rain falls. Back at home, the reverie ends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248786</url></doc>
