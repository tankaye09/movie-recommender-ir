<plot>"The Hermit Of Manana" is the true story of Ray Phillips, a New York City dropout who lived alone on a tiny isolated island for fifty years. The film traces his journey, pieces together the stories of those who knew him, and sifts through the myths which engulf his legacy. While the hermit lifestyle seems outlandish to most, this film shows the values and struggles in a life of simplicity and survival.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564221</url></doc>
