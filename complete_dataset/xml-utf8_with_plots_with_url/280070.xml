<plot>Will wakes up in a strange house, with nothing but the clothes on his back, a pair of muddy boots, and a mysterious phone number scrawled on a matchbook. Seeking answers to how he got there he tempts fate and calls the number. This sets in motion a bizarre chain of events where bodies inexplicably turn up in closets and trusted lovers suddenly turn into killers. Answers only lead to more questions. Who is the mysterious woman who haunts his dreams? Is she his salvation or the culmination of his deepest and darkest fears? Will sets out on a quest to find the true meaning of the word "Joy."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280070</url></doc>
