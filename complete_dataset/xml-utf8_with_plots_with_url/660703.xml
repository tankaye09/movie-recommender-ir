<plot>Why did the American kitchen evolve from a utilitarian room to the hub of the home? Why do men suddenly have an opinion in a home's decor? How has our desire for open floorplans changed the rules of interior design? How has telecommuting changing the definition of "home"? In each episode, host Christopher Lowell examines a popular design trend through a person, couple or family facing a design dilemma. Christopher breaks down the design solution to its essential elements, including what inspired this look - bar, hotel, lounge, spa, restaurant or any other public space. Through consultation with the homeowners, he brings their ultimate design to life in Fine Living Network's Work That Room with Christopher Lowell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660703</url></doc>
