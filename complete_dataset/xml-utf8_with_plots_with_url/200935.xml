<plot>This was the first American motorcycle roadracing series that was covered (from first race to last) completely on television. It followed the "anything goes" WERA motorcycle roadracing class of "Formula USA" from track to track across the USA (with one race in Canada). The event was unique in that there were no rules- you could ride whatever motorcycle you wanted. As Bill Huth (the originator of the series) said, "You can run a Chevy engine in the bike if you want to!" The racing series attracted the best racers and teams from the country, including teams fielded by racing legends Kenny Roberts (who in the first year ran 250cc GP race bikes with nitrous oxide to try to make up for the lack of horse power against the big 1100cc superbikes) and Wayne Rainey. Racers like Rich Oliver, Robbie Petersen, Chuck Graves, Kenny Roberts Jr. Scott Russell, Doug Chandler, Mike Smith, Kurt Hall, Donald Jacks, and many others displayed their skills for the the racing fans and cameras. In the second year, Team Kenny Roberts showed up with a pair of 500cc GP race bikes and dominated the field.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200935</url></doc>
