<plot>Jimmy's notion of love comes from what he's seen in the movies. He lives in a fantasy world where his emotions can only be described in cinematic terms. After a love affair with Sadie, ends abruptly, he realizes that his idea of love is a series of film techniques. He is only copying moments that he thinks are real, but soon realizes they are in fact superficial. He examines his relationship and and explores key moments that help him realize that he does in fact love Sadie and wants her back. Even if his love affair isn't as glamorous as the movies, he'll accept a reality that includes Sadie. Will Jimmy get his happy ever after, or is that just stuff of movies?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523783</url></doc>
