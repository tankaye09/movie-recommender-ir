<plot>Someone is distributing a super-worm virus named THE GAP. It's creating a media-sequence worldwide, which although turns viewers into better people who are honest, compassionate and peaceful, for politicians, it's a shady gift of deceit, money and power. This is something our hero Trygg Nell has to overcome as he is thrust into a world of intrigue and temptation with only the help of a young farmer's daughter, Caress McIvan, who turns out to be a very talented hacker and Internet genius to help him uncover the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559784</url></doc>
