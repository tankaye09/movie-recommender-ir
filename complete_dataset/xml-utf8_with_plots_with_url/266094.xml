<plot>When student doctor James Silverdale meets Cristabel Foldova from Prague working in a London restaurant, they are smitten with one another, and fall in love. It soon becomes evident that Cristabel is an ambitious girl and that she will do what is necessary to have her own nightclub in the city. James meanwhile is resentful that his doctor brother is paying for his university education. He takes refuge in drink and talks of quitting university and running off to Peru. When Cristabel tells James that she is moving to Mayfair, he begins to suspect that she has a sugar daddy on the side who is helping her in exchange for sex.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266094</url></doc>
