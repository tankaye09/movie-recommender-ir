<plot>Tomato on a Grapevine is an experimental documentary about Fernando, a Spanish exchange student, and his search for the ideal American woman. We follow Fernando around the streets of Southern California's popular beach towns as he looks for interesting women to interview. When things don't turn out as expected, and anxieties set in, the film becomes a meditation on the difficulties of being a young person in a strange place and trying something new. Fernando's quest becomes less about finding women, and more about finding and exploring part of himself. In the end, he has not discovered anything new about American women. Despite his resulting introspection, perhaps all he has discovered about himself is that his is more complex than any standard definition.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611886</url></doc>
