<plot>After Laxmi has had three still-births, her husband, Satyaprakash and his mother are afraid she will not be able to give any more births, and therefore there will be no one to carry the name of the family forward. So they propose that Satyaprakash gets married for a second time, to which Laxmi consents to, and as such he gets married to Rukmani. After this marriage Laxmi gets pregnant and gives birth to a son, Rajkumar, and shortly thereafter Rukmani too gives birth to a son, Lakhan. Rajkumar is abducted, and disappears from their lives. Thereafter, Satyaprakash is arrested for the murder of a contractor, and sentenced to prison. Rukmani and her brother, Buddiram, take over running the household, and inflict abuse on Laxmi. Years later, a young man appears claiming to be the missing son of Laxmi and Satyaprakash, and he attempts to bring some sense and honor for poor Laxmi. But this does not last for long, when Satyaprakash is released from prison, he recognizes the young man, as his fellow prison inmate, and much to the shock and dismay of Laxmi, asks him to leave the house, little knowing that he has now thrown open the door for Buddhiram to kill him and Laxmi.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238707</url></doc>
