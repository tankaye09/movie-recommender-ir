<plot>Kemosabe version 1.0 utilizes deconstruction to examine and comment on two American icons, "The Lone Ranger" and his faithful sidekick "Tonto" through reassemblage. The representations of Native Americans in American media have historically proven problematic because most opinions regarding Native Americans were formed through individual's exposure to these inaccurate portrayals, and it has been these inaccurate portrayals which have confined Native Americans to exist solely in the past and not as a contemporary people within the American psyche. The montage re-presented in Kemosabe version 1.0 illustrates how American media, intentionally or not, did and does negatively and inaccurately portray Native Americans, whereas the subtext of Kemosabe version 1.0 illustrates how the "Lone Ranger" has subjugated "Tonto" as he consumes and assumes "Tonto's" "Indian-ness".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?289478</url></doc>
