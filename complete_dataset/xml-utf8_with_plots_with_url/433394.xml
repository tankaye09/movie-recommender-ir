<plot>The Pink Panther opens a corn vending stand adjacent to his vast corn field, which is invaded by a tenacious pair of crows who begin devouring the panther's corn. When the panther places a scarecrow next to the field, the crows remove the clothes from the scarecrow and pose as a customer to sample the corn at the Pink Panther's stand. When the panther realizes that he is being tricked, he opens fire upon the crows with his rifle. An escalating war between panther and crows involves the panther's use of a box trap, grenades painted to look like corn, and machine gun shells, none of which stop the two crows from further raids on the field. The Pink Panther builds a brick wall, which one of the crows impacts, and the rain of bricks strikes the second crow. The Pink Panther pities the two seriously injured birds and allows them to eat some of the corn, and the crows summon all their friends to join them!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433394</url></doc>
