<plot>Charley is turning 15. For the past year, since his mother's death, he has lived in Seaside, Oregon, with his stern and unloving father. It's Christmas week when Charley meets Eban, a young-looking 29-year-old teacher from Seattle, home for the holidays to see his parents. They have things in common: both sign (Charley's mother was deaf), both play the guitar, both are gay. As their relationship deepens during walks on the beach, singing, and talk of poetry, we see it from their point of view and also from the points of view of both of their fathers. Charley's loneliness gives way to happiness when he's with Eban. But what of this grown man?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164897</url></doc>
