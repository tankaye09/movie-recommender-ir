<plot>'Gareth Malone' (qv), a choir master, believes in the therapeutic benefits of singing. He takes on a nine month challenge of creating a choir at Lancaster School, an English boys school comprised of students in their early teens. The school is known primarily for its sports program, with no recent history of organized singing at the school. As such, Gareth has to start from the very beginning. There is much initial resistance from the student body. There are some boys who do sing in organized choirs, but have previously hidden that fact from their fellow students. There are some boys who need this opportunity to become more socialized regardless of their musical ability or lack thereof. And there are some boys who are vocally gifted but do not see the choir as something they want to do. Gareth needs to overcome all of these obstacles, and some external chorus adjudicators, to achieve his end goal of having a 100 strong boys choir perform at a prestigious by invitation only youth musical event at Royal Albert Hall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548601</url></doc>
