<plot>Kenny is a tiger shark who has found himself in the strange position of being a family pet. Kenny has all the characteristics and instincts of any other tiger shark, but he must adapt himself to the placid ways of suburban family life. If not, he'll be put back out to sea, which would mean giving up his best friend Kat, which would be unthinkable! Kenny is about an 8-foot, 1,500-pound tiger shark who lives with 10-year-old Kat and her family in the suburbs. Her parents are tolerant of Kenny, but he's big and smelly. Luckily, Kat speaks shark, so she tries to reason with Kenny when he wants to eat the mail or mail carrier. If Kenny can't adapt to life under a roof, he'll have to go back to the sea. Kat learns that living with a shark isn't that easy since they eat everything, they never sleep, and they constantly shed their teeth. To stay with Kat, Kenny must fight his natural carvings, making do with imitation seal flakes and resisting the desire to eat Kat's baby brother, who smells very tasty. But as often as the family adopts wild animals, problems arise. Kenny is almost always hungry. Keeping him fed and her family safe is Kat's most important task. Kat also faces the challenge of keeping Kenny from eating Dad's beanbag chairs, teaching Kenny to mind his manners, and keeping him out of trouble. Kenny is constantly shedding his teeth, and his crazy behavior sometimes keeps Kat up all night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?289689</url></doc>
