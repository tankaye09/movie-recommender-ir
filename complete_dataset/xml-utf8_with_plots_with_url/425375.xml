<plot>For this scene the multitude is watching Christ, who appears with His disciples on the road to Jericho. Zaccheus, a very small man, tries to look over the heads of the people and finding it impossible, climbs into the branches of a tree. Christ sees him and asks him to come down. Zaccheus does so and crosses to Jesus. After the animated dialogue between Jesus and Zaccheus, Jesus takes his arm and, followed by the disciples, they pass on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425375</url></doc>
