<plot>A "mockumentary" for the BBC, the program purports to be a behind-the-scenes look at the life of Lord Of The Dance and Feet of Flames star Michael Flatley. Real people are interviewed portraying the intimate details of his life, but in fact, these testimonials are staged. The basis for the "fake" documentary is that a BBC news team shadows him to show a side not seen before. The program features he and his troupe rehearsing "Celtic Tiger".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292526</url></doc>
