<plot>This feature length documentary/experimental film called "I Ate the H0le Thing" celebrates 36 diverse Canadian women in more than 6 languages. Women of a multitude of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, ages, sizes, shapes, (dis)Abilities (renamed Uniquenesses) orientations, identities, socio-economics, backgrounds, ideas and beliefs are featured. Each woman was given a list of words and asked to create whatever piece she wanted to, by using these words as a spring board. The Director/Producer Ariel Len of Zoey's Projects, selected a combination of artists in dance, puppetry, performance and written poetry, visual art, and burlesque, as well as actors, and most importantly of all, a large sampling of the amazing everyday Canadian women heroes who are out there making things happen and keeping it all together! This film includes a performance piece called "Size 0" which is the burial of the myth that this is the one and only "ideal" size for a woman. It also includes true stories, theories, ideas, and beliefs, in addition to the performance art, all of which are celebrating the phenomenal strength and enduring spirit of our Canadian Women.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252058</url></doc>
