<plot>Huge live show in which the inhabitants of various towns, competed against each other for fame, fortune and a spot in the national finals. Competitions ranged from the towns trying to gather certain amounts of specific items in time, to having their local national guard looking for clues in the woods or their emergency units and divers searching for hidden treasures in the harbour. All the events in the two towns, with one reporting co-host in each, were linked together with the studio and the two main hosts, into one huge all-night gameshow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088645</url></doc>
