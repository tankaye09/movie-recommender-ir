<plot>A film essay about the New York City based artist Kurt B. Delbanco (born 1909 in Hamburg, Germany). His fine art and sculptures "breathe" the spirit of Goethe's philosophy (color theory) and curved organic shapes. Kurt was a former refugee from Nazi Germany and so he had a lot sad things to tell - contratictory to his cheerful art. To him, the term "design" in in no case a swear word compared to "art".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135616</url></doc>
