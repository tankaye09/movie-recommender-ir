<plot>A convict escapes from prison and on his way finds the apparel of a female who has gone bathing in an adjacent brook. He dons her attire and rushes off leaving his in their place. Our female friend returns, and not finding the clothes she left there, attires herself in that of the convict. She retires, but not before the officers catch her, thinking they have their man. She throws them aside by almost superhuman strength and dashes off, leaving them to follow as best they may.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093902</url></doc>
