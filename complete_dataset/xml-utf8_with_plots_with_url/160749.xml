<plot>An evil Druid warlord resurrects a young man and transforms him into a wicked superhero. With the help of a nice young woman, the superhero eventually begins to question his diabolical beliefs. As if his hands weren't full enough with his study of good and evil, he also has to deal with the confusion caused by his clone, the beasts of The Druid Gladiator Match, and, of course, the scheming Druid warlord.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160749</url></doc>
