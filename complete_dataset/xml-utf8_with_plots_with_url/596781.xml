<plot>Harold Maines spent his life haunted by the thought that he was born into the wrong body. As a child he experimented with supernatural powers, heard animals talk and developed a strange fascination with horses. When he came of age, he rejected this childhood fascination to pursue what he perceived as the "American dream" of a job, wife and kids. After temporarily succeeding, he eventually decides to abandon his family and his job for life on a horse farm in rural Illinois. And when this new life turns out to be less than idyllic, he decides he must leave his human body forever. Set in the months following Harold's disappearance, this film by Jared W. Johnson features improvised documentary-style interviews, a series of animated dream sequences and an original soundtrack by Neilson Hubbard.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596781</url></doc>
