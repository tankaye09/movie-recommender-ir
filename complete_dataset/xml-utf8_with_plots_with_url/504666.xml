<plot>When Lajjo is at her deathbed, she summons her stepson, Rahu, so that he can look after her son, Beli. Rahu does attend her residence, just before her death, assists with the funeral and offers to take Beli with him and look after him. Rahu hires a hit-man named Jaggu and instructs him to kill Beli. Jaggu is unable to kill Beli, angering Rahu to no end. Rahu then pushes Jaggu and Beli from a cliff and hopes that they have met their respective ends. Rahu then sets about to claim Lajjo's property, by hiring a man to pose as Beli. Months later, Rahu approaches a wealthy woman for her only daughter's (Parvati) hand in marriage. While Paro's mother approves of Rahu, Paro is in love with someone else. While her mother finds out that she is in love with a mere employee, she dismisses him, and make arrangements for her marriage with Rahu. Watch the suspense and the climax unfold as Rahu prepares to get married to Paro, with the assurance that no one can ever get in his way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?504666</url></doc>
