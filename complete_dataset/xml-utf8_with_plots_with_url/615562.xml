<plot>Jim Malloy, known far and wide as "Trigger" because of his fast draw and deadly shooting ability, is being released from prison after serving time on a framed-up charge, is met by his kid brother who brings him his horse Black King and his guns. The brother says he has joined an outlaw gang, but Jim whips him and sends him home to take care of their mother. Jim rides off and goes to the town where the man who framed him is and shoots him. He then joins a gang of bank robbers and is in town casing the job when the Bar X boys, who have the town terrorized, ride in and Jim shoots the foreman, but is shot in the back on his way out of the saloon. He is taken to the express office where he is treated by Janet, who runs the office since her husband was killed. Janet's daughter, Mary Jane, worships the slow-recovering Malloy, who is offered the job of sheriff to replace the one killed by the Bar X boys. This suits him as he will now be in charge of guarding the money he came to town to steal. But the love of a good woman, a small child and an ugly horse leads him to reformation, a project that also includes gunning down Wild Bill Holman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615562</url></doc>
