<plot>Were the anthrax attacks following 9/11 an act of terrorism or a secret program designed to test biological weapons delivery systems. One man, a biological weapons expert named Michael Patrick, knows the truth and tries to warn an unsuspecting public, but before he can get the word out he mysteriously contracts a deadly virus, ironically one of the pathogens he helped to develop as a weapon. - Before Michael dies he tells a former colleague, Katherine Peeples, about the secret germ lab he helped to develop, a string of scientists that have mysteriously died who have links to biological weapons research, and a wacko doctor that claimed he worked for the CIA and the government of South Africa on their bio-weapons programs. - Will Katherine, now in possession of proof of Michael's assertions succeed in telling the world about the secret lab, the scientists that have died, or the mad LA doctor's cache of deadly pathogens? Or will she too be silenced by powerful forces intent on keeping their nefarious schemes secret.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445945</url></doc>
