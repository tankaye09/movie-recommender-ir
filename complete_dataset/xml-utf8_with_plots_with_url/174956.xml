<plot>Edgy late-night variety show that featured new music, new ideas, new art in the thriving coffee house culture of the mid-90's. Each show began with a rant from host Philippe Hartley, "your guide to the underground", culminating in surprise popping out from a "box", such as a voluptuous diva singing an aria. The program then delivered a succession of very visually layered, quick cut segments on different artists, including a painter in each episode, and an interview of an author or personality, and punctuated by whimsical intersticial computer graphics.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174956</url></doc>
