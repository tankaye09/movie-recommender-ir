<plot>Kym Whitley goes aboard the 2008 Tom Joyner Fantastic Voyage cruise in search of love. She flirts with everyone from the crew members to the island men, to no avail. In the meantime, Kym discovers she has a bona fide stalker who shows up on the ship and at every island stop. The stalker is really Kym's old friend, who she's just not interested in. When Kym decides to host a Singles party event aboard the ship, the stalker shows up to profess his love in the most hilarious way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119888</url></doc>
