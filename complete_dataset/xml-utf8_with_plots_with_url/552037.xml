<plot>Dave Gorman and Danny Wallace had a bet that Dave couldn't meet 54 of his namesakes (1 for every card in the deck including the jokers). It all got out of hand and they ended up travelling tens of thousands of miles around the world with Daves credit card and Danny's video camera to complete the task. Only after the event, with the help of the home video footage was the journey turned in to this TV series.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?552037</url></doc>
