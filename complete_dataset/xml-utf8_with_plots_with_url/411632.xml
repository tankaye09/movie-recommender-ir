<plot>They say there's one love we can't shake. One love that sends us packing with an armful of baggage. One disastrous relationship that brings us to the crossroads of idealism and cynicism. None of us wants to be there, but somehow, at least once, we find ourselves staring at the divergent paths and scratching our heads. And then our feet move, heading the wrong way despite knowing better. So we put our heads down and buckle up for a bumpy ride. But do those roads lead to the same place? And are there detours? Stella's about to find out. Heartbroken over her losses, Stella finds herself walking down that dark road. But even dark roads have occasional pit stops. Her spirited friend Emily, tries to pull her off by setting her up with Stanley. Stella and Stanley seem to hit it off, until the road sends a mirage of Simon, Stella's infamous ex. Suddenly, Simon's at every turn, providing roadside attraction and enjoying every devilish minute of it. Stella just can't shake him. Then she meets Derek. Derek's on the road himself, but he's found the detour, and he wants Stella to come along. Suddenly, Stella's at another crossroads. Will she make the same mistake twice? Does the good guy really get the girl? Or does that only happen in the movies?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411632</url></doc>
