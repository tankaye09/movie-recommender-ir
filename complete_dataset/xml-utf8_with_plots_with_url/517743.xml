<plot>This picture is both about Lea Ivanova and Eddy Kazasyan and about the generation, who lived in socialist period and strived for their identity in strange and fearful times. This film refers to gifted ones, who regardless of the time and the space are capable through their powers to blow up the walls of alienation between people, making them better. The film tells by songs, that sucked the time and the spirit in them, a truthful legend of the great singer Lea, who though deceased, still lives in her songs. This is a film about the Eternal Love and the fateful relationship between a man and a woman and about their life in music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517743</url></doc>
