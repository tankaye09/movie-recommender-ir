<plot>"This is a remarkable picture and has caused a great deal of favourable comment wherever it has been shown. When the picture opens, smoke is seen pouring from the windows of a hotel, and a battalion of Parisian firemen rush into the scene. Streams of water are quickly brought to bear on the fire and the work of rescue starts in. In the fourth story window a woman appears, shouting for help. With the aid of scaling ladders several men reach her, and she is let down in safety by means of a rope. The fire is in full blast by this time, and other rescues are effected. Ambulances and physicians have in the meantime arrived. The negative is quite long, as will be noted, but the interest is intense throughout."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011674</url></doc>
