<plot>Heralded as one of the most gifted writers of his generation, Fitzgerald was known for his novels and stories of the 1920's. He created cynical, but glittering characters to define the Jazz Age as one of irresponsibility. Named after the author of The Star Spangled Banner, Fitzgerald was born in St. Louis, Minnesota to an affluent family. He spent his time in the fashionable resorts of Europe and in Long Island and Washington D.C. His life was rich and glamorous, but ended tragically with his wife's mental illness and his own subsequent breakdown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188970</url></doc>
