<plot>Petchara is a beautiful working woman who lives in Chum Chon Ruam Jai. Her father is Pichet, a Pad Thai stall owner, and her married younger sister, a pretty and talkative girl, is Aranya. Petchara is a talented cook - and Pad Thai is one of her specialty dishes. One day, while fighting with her sister over her marriage prospects, Petchara says too much, claiming that she will marry whoever eats her Pad Thai for 100 days straight. Wiwat, a local TV producer, senses an opportunity and quickly sets up a game show, "Pad Thai's Love," to contest for a Bt1 million prize and Petchara's hand in marriage. All of the villagers support Surachat, a handsome professor and their next-door neighbor, to compete in the game, while Petchara secretly hopes he wins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273938</url></doc>
