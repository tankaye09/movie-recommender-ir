<plot>Maria and Jose, a thirty-something Nuyorican couple, lead a normal and quiet existence. Well, as quiet and normal as The Bronx will allow. One particular Saturday night, Maria feels the urge to shake things up. She wants to dance! Jose, though, would rather stick to his usual routine: sit on the couch, eat cuchifritos (fried stuff), and watch his favorite television show "Sabado Gigante" hosted by Don Francisco. This story tackles the need for improved communication between couples. Is the relationship progressing? Are both partners maturing at the same time? Can their bond withstand a change in their lifestyle? All these questions may not be answered by this film, but they are brought to light through comedy, frankness, and a slice of reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214805</url></doc>
