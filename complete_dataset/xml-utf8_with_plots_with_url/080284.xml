<plot>One of the prettiest single train films is here portrayed. The surrounding country is not alone beautiful, but the train one of the fastest on the road, is seen bowling along at a terrific rate. When it first appears in view, nothing is seen but a huge cloud of smoke issuing from the smokestack. The train is down in a hollow and finally rushes up the hill with lightning rapidity, and shoots toward the audience who invariably rise in their seats as though there were in fear of being run down. A truly wonderful subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080284</url></doc>
