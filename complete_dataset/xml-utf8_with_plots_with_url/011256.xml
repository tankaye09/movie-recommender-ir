<plot>A GUEST TO THE ROAD, highlights the struggles of five young men from Columbus, Ohio who embark on a perilous journey in search of Rock n' Roll stardom. From their humble beginnings in the heart of small town America, with nothing more than themselves and a bus on its last wheel, they discover the truth behind the music they play while coming to grips that their own worst enemy to their success may, in fact, be themselves. Conceived in the Spring of 2003 by Producer Matt DeRoss and Director Phillip Montgomery, A GUEST TO THE ROAD shows the truth behind the struggle to Rock n' Roll as told by a band living the struggle. With an intimate crew and master sound recordist, they traveled to the band's home state, where, they captured two remarkably different live show experiences, both good and bad, along with candid interviews and documentary footage exposing the reality behind the dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011256</url></doc>
