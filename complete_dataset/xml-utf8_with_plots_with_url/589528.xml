<plot>A children's classic for more than 40 years, Pierre Berton's The Secret World of Og has the other-worldly aspect of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", together with thematic elements of the "The Indian in the Cupboard". It's a coming of age story about four Berton siblings, Penny, Pamela, Patsy and Peter, who discover a cavern beneath their clubhouse floor. A tapestry of adventure and imagination, the animated series starts with the Berton kids' inaugural journey to locate their lost baby brother (Paul or "Pollywog"), and continues on, along the underground river, as they explore, investigate, and attempt to solve mysteries along the way. Imagine ... learning life lessons ... but learning them in a secret world all your own. No one else knows of its existence ... and no one can be permitted to know. It's your world, and your responsibility to keep the people that dwell there a secret. But who are these Ogs? Where did they come from? How long have they remained hidden in the cavern and why? The history of the Ogs is at the very core of the series. Along the winding river, past the mushroom valleys, is a mystery waiting to be solved. Buried in thick layers of antiquity are stone statues, strange ruins and ancient relics ... all clues to a grand mystery. But it's also a voyage of self-discovery - for the Ogs as well as for the kids.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589528</url></doc>
