<plot>The Missing Peace is a rites of passage tale about a 14-year-old girl, Larmort, whose name in English means death. She lives in a small village with her weary but wise grandmother, outside of the capital Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. It is 1991 and a coup has just occurred leaving the country in turmoil. Larmort and her grandmother rent a room to Emilie, a Haitian-American journalist, who solicits Larmor's help in finding her missing mother. The Missing Peace is an adaptation of a short story from the book "Krik Krak?" by noted Haitian novelist Edwidge Danticat</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576969</url></doc>
