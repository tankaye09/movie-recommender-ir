<plot>Long before TV's "American Idol" became a mega-hit, there was one radio and television series that started the talent competition craze. It was called: "The Original Amateur Hour." Almost 50 major stars of movies, records, stage, screen and television got their start on this series. One was singer Pat Boone, who hosts this entertaining glimpse into this landmark series. See and hear the first performances of struggling amateurs such as Frank Sinatra, Nick Carter, Gladys Knight, Ann-Margret, Robert Klein, Raul Julia, Beverly Sills, and others. Pat Boone also shows us some of the wildest and wackiest novelty acts from "The Original Amateur Hour." From one-legged tap dancers to impressionists. And from crazy kitchen bands and one-man-bands to jugglers and saw players, the series that made the "gong" and "the wheel of fortune" famous, had them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580662</url></doc>
