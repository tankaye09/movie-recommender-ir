<plot>Three people are trapped in an elevator. They've been there for a while. No-one responds to their shouts and the emergency phone is dead. They can't even get a mobile phone signal. As tempers fray, each will judge the other for different reasons, whilst the musak over the speaker is indifferent to their anger. When the lights go out, anger gives way to fear, and it's not long until they realize the terrible truth of where they are.</plot><plot>Three people are trapped in an elevator.
