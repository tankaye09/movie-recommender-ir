<plot>The characters you play were once ordinary people until they were mutated into the game's monsters: George, the giant ape; Lizzie, the giant lizard; and Ralph, the giant wolf. George was mutated after swallowing mega-vitamins, Lizzie was mutated after bathing in a radioactive lake, and Ralph was mutated after eating sausage scam. The mutants' goal is to destroy every city which they come upon. The game has 768 days of destruction and some of them are alike. The players move from city to city destroying skyscrapers and various vehicles and eating people that get in the way. Health is awarded at startup and during the game by putting quarters in. Health is decreased by being shot by National Guardsmen, being hit by another monster, falling, being hit by cops or tanks, going underwater, being struck by lightning, or by eating something bad, like dynamite. Health is replenished by eating food found in the buildings. Once all buildings in a city have been destroyed, the monsters move onto another city.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454950</url></doc>
