<plot>He escaped from the Treblinka concentration camp, along with 400 other Jews who successfully fought back against their Nazi captors. (Only 67 of them survived the war.) Now Samuel Willenberg has gone back to Poland to try to understand his life and fathom the motives, feelings and prejudices of the Poles who both helped and hindered him.
