<plot>Elijah, a classical composer, and Carmen, a painter, are artists struggling to find inspiration. Their lives soon cross paths and the inspiration that they had both been looking for is found in each other. With the realization that without each other their art would suffer, they increasingly become obsessed with each other and their work. Carmen is the one to realize the danger of this relationship and tries to detach herself. Elijah who has become insane through the constant obsession cannot deal with the sudden detachment of Carmen. He poisons Carmen, and then himself, where they die in sync with each other at the place the first met.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165537</url></doc>
