<plot>On Hannah Smith's second day managing a home for foster children, she runs into pediatrician Jacob Hartman and doesn't think she'll be able to work alongside him - when he was a teen, he was responsible for the auto accident that killed her brother. Women, Dr. Jacob Hartman knew, were a mystery. Even as he gave free medical care to the kids, Hannah stared him down as if he'd come at her with castor oil. Why? His past was full of heavy duty heartache, but he was positive they'd never met. And as a former foster child himself, Jacob was deeply touched by how much she cared about the kids at the home, how loving she was to everyone but him. Jacob finds himself attracted to Hannah but can they ever learn to forgive, trust again, and build a new life together?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233268</url></doc>
