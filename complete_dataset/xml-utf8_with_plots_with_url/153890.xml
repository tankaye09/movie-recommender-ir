<plot>Doesn't Texas Ever End? A dramady...kinda like life. Sean and Ashley are in love, and they planned on getting married, that was until she made the big mistake of following him to LA where he got sucked into "the lifestyle". His LA friends are bad news, money-grubbing narcissists who act like they have the accounting world by the cahunas. His boss who's supposed to be his mentor spends his life trying to grease the wheels of his 19 year old girlfriend, Mercedez and sweep scandals under the rug. Now Ashley has decided to leave him and their life in LA and head back home to Texas. His plan: Drive her home and try to win her back along the way. The problem is he's a little lost. He's lost himself and his dreams to the corporate world and now he's lost the woman he loves along with it. He has 2000 miles to win her back... and she has 2000 miles to stand her ground. Between California and Texas he has to juggle pleasing his boss back in LA and show Ashley that he's still worthy of her love and respect. Unfortunately for Sean, she has lost faith in love and certainly lost faith in him. Their trip is the move from hell, between getting on each other's nerves, a broken down car, a series of mishaps, downright bizarre people and circumstances, maybe they can still salvage their relationship. 'Doesn't Texas Ever End?' It's a dramedy... kinda like life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153890</url></doc>
