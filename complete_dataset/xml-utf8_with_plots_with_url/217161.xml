<plot>Documentary about the barrister and perhaps the most controversal Danish politician ever Mogens Glistrup who claimed on national television in 1971 that he didn't pay a cent in taxes. This document portrays the daily life of him and his wife Lene which is a fairly normal life. Only, he spends most of his time working on his political crusade, collecting articles and notes on Muslim culture. His goal is a published work about the future of Denmark, so far 8,600 pages and still counting.. He refers to his work as The Case.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217161</url></doc>
