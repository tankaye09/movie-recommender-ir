<plot>Sven Stromson is an eccentric artist who makes outrageous claims, such as he invented his own color blue and painted the sky. Sven may have original ideas, but he doesn't have the recognition of the public and fellow artists, such as his hero, Jack Thurgood. To solve this, Sven plans a live, public art show he believes will rocket him to fame. But to pull it off, he needs the participation of a woman, and he looks to Nancy, his ex lover, for help. Sven must convince her to help him execute his greatest work of art yet, or else he'll look like a fool and lose his one shot at becoming an artist</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?524249</url></doc>
