Karl is tired of being single and has decided to do something about it! So Karl heads off around Ireland on an emotional and comical journey through the romantic obstacle course of modern dating - tackling speed-dating, signing up to dating agencies, sampling Internet dating, taking ads in newspapers and even meeting a matchmaker.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287159</url></doc>
