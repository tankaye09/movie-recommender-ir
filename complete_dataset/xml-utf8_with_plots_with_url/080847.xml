<plot>When his beloved wife unexpectedly leaves him for another woman, a childless 40something small-town Alberta car mechanic begins to question himself and his entire existence. Choosing to follow his deeper impulses for the first time in his life, Joey Cooper unexpectedly acquires an exquisite cello and travels to Calgary where he embarks on a journey of self-discovery and personal redemption. Based on Ivan E. Coyote's breathtaking first novel, Bow Grip is about loneliness, love, the modern family, and a man who is transformed to embrace them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080847</url></doc>
