<plot>Joey does every outlandish trick in the book to derail Billy and Grasya's wedding plans. Only to get himself harrassed by his girl, May... and into doubly outrageous trouble he finds a hell of a time to get off the hook from. He's got three days to make good on his well-laid plans that always seem to have a sick and sorry way of backfiring on him. It's when the supposed to be wedding's bestman's hare brained schemes seem to be working when fate again springs it's nastiest trick. The moment Billy finds out about Joey's schemes, he sets out to do some scheming of his own. It takes two to bungle, really!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066552</url></doc>
