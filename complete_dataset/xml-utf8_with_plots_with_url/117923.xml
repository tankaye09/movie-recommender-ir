<plot>Maggie Dickenson has always been a loner when it came to dating. She's had a variety of crushes throughout her life, but there tends to be a common denominator: the crushes are always on gay men; who, frankly, aren't interested. This crush is no different. Todd, her best friend, is her new love interest. As he is absorbed in a relationship he just ended, he is completely unaware. Maggie, however, is contemplating her next step. She's always felt attracted to men who like men. She's also always identified with men. Could this mean that she was meant to be male? With the support of her friend Jay, Maggie is determined to make the first step towards becoming a male: meeting Dr. Grinzkowski, the infamous sex-change doctor who is ready and willing to change her life, forever. Will she lose the very man who inspired this change in the process? Or will it prove worthwhile on all fronts? Only after the op will she be able to tell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117923</url></doc>
