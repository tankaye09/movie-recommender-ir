<plot>You don't want to die? Me neither, believe it or not. Of course I'd love to pass another 40 years with you, in your arms, sniffing your neck, telling you things I've never dared tell a man. What do you think? I'm not doing all this out of the lightness of my heart. And anyway, I'm doing you a favour. What would you do all alone with two out of three chances or becoming contaminated? It's that what you want? Look at me. Have you seen my body, do you want to end up in the same way? Here with what I'm planning you can go over to the other side in full beauty. It's young, I know. I also think that dying at 40 is a bummer. But there's nothing we can do about it. It's written that we go together. I've just push destiny's hand a bit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?440401</url></doc>
