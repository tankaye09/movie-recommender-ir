<plot>Kimberly Peirce, director of "Boys Don't Cry" (1999) was inspired to make her second feature film "Stop-Loss" in part because of the experiences of her younger brother who joined the military in the wake of the September 11 attacks on New York. The documentary explores the research phase, during which Peirce and co-screen writer Mark Richard interviewed dozens of soldiers, veterans, parents, and resistors. We follow the production through actor "boot camp" and filming in Texas, in Morocco and on the road. Cast members Ryan Phillippe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Channing Tatum are also interviewed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574094</url></doc>
