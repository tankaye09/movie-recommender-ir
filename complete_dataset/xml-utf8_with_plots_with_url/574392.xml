<plot>An African mythological creature, the Mamtsotsi Bird, is called down from the thunder by witches to carry out missions of malevolence. Musa can feel something evil drawing closer. Her estranged husband Sipho tries to convince her that it's all in her mind because of her alcohol abuse. Having gone for fertility shots Musa thinks her strained marriage will take a turn for the better. Little does she know that her husband has already consorted with evil to get rid of her. Sipho, concerned that nothing has happened at the house returns to the witch doctor for another consultation and is given stronger muti and assured that the bird will perform its task. It's a stormy Sunday night and Musa is waiting for Sipho to come back for the special dinner she has prepared for him. Lightning envelops the sky; a beastly monstrosity swoops down from the hill, summoned by the thunder and launches a ferocious attack on Musa. Sipho returns home where he is greeted by a brutal reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574392</url></doc>
