<plot>This film explores the Queen of Sheba's visit to Jerusalem using the environment to tell the story. Her relationship with King Solomon and the subsequent birth of their son, Menelik, is suggested through music, dancing and sounds. When Menelik grows up into manhood, he persuades his mother to allow him to see his father in Israel. This is depicted through mural paintings. A visit to Jerusalem is granted, and father and son are reunited upon arrival. At this point, Menelik is exposed to the Ark of the Covenant, and his plan to relocate it from Jerusalem to Ethiopia is communicated through mood music and images. When he returns back to Axum with the Ark of the Covenant, jubilant celebration with flutes and drums are used. Ethiopia now becomes a Judeo-Christian country. This offering demonstrates how African men have flourished within an African context in ancient history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365777</url></doc>
