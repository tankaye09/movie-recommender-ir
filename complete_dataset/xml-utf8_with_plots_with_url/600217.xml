<plot>This is a new look at reality TV. Each program is 30 minutes of evangelist and author Ray Comfort and actor Kirk Cameron teaching Christians how to share their faith effectively and inoffensively. In it, you learn how to speak with your unsaved family and friends, and even perfect strangers, and then watch Kirk and Ray go onto the streets and demonstrate how to do it. This is real-life witnessing in action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600217</url></doc>
