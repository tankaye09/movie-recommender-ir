<plot>This realistic panoramic view of the Rockies is taken from the plains overlooking Colorado Springs. The picture commences with Cheyenne Mountain, which rises abruptly from the plains without foot-hills. Passing by North and South Cheyenne Canyons, Pike's Peak, rising to the height of 14,147 feet, is seen twenty-five miles in the distance, clothed in its summer garb. The tracks of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad are slowly working to the centre of the picture. Then in the distance appears the smoke of an approaching train. Serpent-like, the train winds its way along in such a manner that both sides of the cars can be seen at the same time. Sweeping on once more, the remaining ridge of the Rocky Mountains stands out in bold relief against the rising clouds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422066</url></doc>
