<plot>Today's monasteries must be self-supporting. The product from the monks' daily work is to provide for all their needs. But there is a dilemma : how can the necessary business competitivity be conciliated with the monastic vows of poverty and contemplation ? This documentary series will try to show that beyong its exacting and religious aspects, monastic life is changing towards a more modern and contemporary approach, at least economically. An unusual way of finding out more about the spiritual life of these exciting places with their amazing creativity and their real evolution through our technological times.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412709</url></doc>
