<plot>"PLAY" - a film about friendship. A group of young people come together for an early summer weekend by the sea. They are drama school graduates and a tightly knit group about to be broken up. The last three years they have been together day and night. Now they are on the threshold of new lives as professionals - competing for the same parts. These three years they all feel have been the most important period in their lives. They haven't been able to keep much from each other. They've had have their talents tested and their personalities uncovered. They know each other inside-out. Or so they believe. It turns into a weekend of strong feelings and much fun. Of uncomfortable truths and enjoyable memories. Laughter and tears are never far apart. The point is, they don't want to lose each other. Equally, of course, they know full well they will. But one of them carries a secret which will mark them all for life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435019</url></doc>
