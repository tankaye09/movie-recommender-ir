<plot>Jane is a 35 year old housing agent who lives in an idyllic suburb in Brisbane (Australia) with her sick mother and her younger brother Douglas. She is torn between her family responsibilities and her own desire to be free. When Douglas announces his plan to move to Sydney one day, she feels as if the final metal cuffs are clamped on her hands. She wants to escape. She doesn't want to wait anymore.
