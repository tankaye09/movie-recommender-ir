<plot>This tunnel is three miles long through the Cascade Mountains in the State of Washington. It is absolutely straight, and so perfect was the engineering that when the two gangs of workmen met in the heart of the mountain, there was less than an inch variation in their calculations. Our picture, made from the pilot of the engine, starts through two high banks of snow just after a ten foot snow fall had been cut away by a rotary snow-plow. Passing Wellington Station, we enter the East portal and remain in darkness until the small pin head of light indicates that we are coming nearer and nearer to the opposite portal. The light is seen shimmering on the rails and on the damp ceiling of the tunnel. Then comes a beautiful snow scene that grows and grows in size until we burst out into the open snow-covered country once more, and after passing around a double reverse curve, we come to a stop at Cascade Station, with icicles hanging from its eaves. The sharp contrast between the white snow scenes and the inpenetrable darkness in the tunnel, together with the great length of the tunnel and the time it takes to reach the opposite portal after it shows on the screen, combine to make this one of the best tunnel pictures ever made. This is a subject that will never grow stale.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606294</url></doc>
