<plot>New York. In the distant future, nothing is left of the big apple. All that remains are but a few artifacts that Kadar (Garrett Morris), his team of archeologists, and their robot 3572-multiplied-by-3 are struggling to uncover. After a jumble of meaningless finds, they finally discover something that could help them understand what our society was really like. If only they could figure out what it is. In an effort to do so, they wildly speculate on the use and significance that such an object, or should they say objects, had in our modern civilization.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261086</url></doc>
