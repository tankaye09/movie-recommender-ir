<plot>Joe Mielenski has a chip on his shoulder. He thinks he's been dealt a short deck of cards, but trudges through life the best he can as a taxi driver. Enter Grace Stevens, a terminally ill woman who needs his help to get to a hospice to live out her final days. As they travel along her chosen route, it becomes an astounding trip through memory lane. Eventually their generational contrasts and differences of opinion surface, but in the long run they find a way to influence each others' lives</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546929</url></doc>
