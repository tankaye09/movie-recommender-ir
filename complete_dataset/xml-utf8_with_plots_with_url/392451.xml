<plot>Nothing bad could ever happen on quiet, tree lined Wormwood Drive. At least that's what Bob and Wendi Petersen thought, before they met their new neighbor... Having moved across country so that Bob can begin a dream job with Zeecor, a large industrial corporation, the newly married couple looked forward to starting a new life together, far away from the crime and violence of the big city. Zeecor even provided them with a spacious company home on a peaceful suburban street. What more could a young couple ask for? But behind every perfect neighborhood, there hides a dark secret. On Wormwood Drive that secret is named Adrien Trumbull. Seemingly friendly, yet disturbingly intense, the hulking Trumbull welcomes his young new neighbors with a greeting of a box chocolates and kind words. Touched by his neighborly gestures, Bob and Wendi gratefully accept Trumbull's thoughtful gifts and friendship. However, Trumbull is not at all what he seems to be. Behind his welcoming grin lurks a dark obsession with poison and self-mutilation and within the walls of his rancid home, hides pure madness. For Bob and Wendi Petersen, the neighborhood of their dreams is about to become a living nightmare. As darkness falls, they will soon learn the true meaning of fear. For on Wormwood Drive, the night has eyes and the neighbors are watching. Based on two true stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392451</url></doc>
