<plot>A large grinning skeleton is seen getting up from a chair on which it has been seated, walk to the center of the stage and there execute some of the most difficult steps in the art of dancing. His head suddenly rises into space and returns; one by one the legs and arms leave the body, walk and dance around the stage and finally return to the body again as naturally as though they had never left it. The skeleton again dances and finally walks off the stage. This film was not made from a toy skeleton but from a large life sized one. His jaws can be seen plainly working all the time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125671</url></doc>
