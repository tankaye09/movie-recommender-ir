<plot>Calum's Road is the epic true story of one man who stood up to be counted. Who fought to bring his community and his island into the 20th Century. When the world said no to a road to his remote village on a tiny Scottish island, Calum Macleod set out, in an unforgiving landscape, to build it himself by hand. Breaking wheelbarrows and hammers and his own body, it took him 10 years to carve out 2 miles through rock, moor and hills. The world was against him. But he persevered. This is Calum MacLeod's story. He was a hero.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091374</url></doc>
