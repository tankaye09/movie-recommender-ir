<plot>Lao is a young man who lives and breathes Kung Fu Films. He imagines himself to be some kind of martial arts master from all the Kung Fu films he's watched. A small band of hoodlums in his neighborhood knows this and takes great pleasure in humiliating Lao, especially in front of cute girls. One day, on a day like any other day, Lao's dream becomes a reality when he finds a pair of old Chinese shoes in a dark and dusty antique shop. He discovers that the shoes once belonged to a Shaolin monk, a master of Kung Fu. Lao believes that the shoes will somehow give him the power their previous owner. He's right. Lao's delight in his new shoes is cut short when he is put in a position where his martial arts mastery is put to the test. This day, a day like any other day, Lao tries to impress a girl and exact his revenge, only to learn that power is worthless without wisdom and discipline.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?332491</url></doc>
