<plot>Johnny is a young man who develops an interest in a girl, who seems to share an interest in him... only one problem, Johnny doesn't have any confidence. Johnny decides to confide in Tony, the trusted pharmacist, informing him of his issue. With the assistance of Tony, Johnny eliminates his lack of confidence for a small price, and becomes enabled to pursue his interests with Melissa. However, we find that each solution Tony prescribes only leads to more problems. Johnny is thrown on a roller coaster ride of prescriptions, and becomes hooked, looking for more. But when Johnny comes up short on the dough, Tony is unable to provide any more 'solutions'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069729</url></doc>
