<plot>Bipasha returns quite late on the night of Durga Puja, and finds a septuagenarian old man, Amarnath standing at the entrance gate of the building housing her flat. Amarnath has lost his way and cannot find his way back home. Unfortunately, he fails to remember the address of his house. The other residents of the building find Amarnath suspicious and drive him out. From her terrace, Bipasha chances to see Amarnath lying on the road. She gets terribly disturbed as it brings back memories of her father suffering from depression and getting run over on the road. Bipasha rushes down the stairs and brings Amarnath to her flat. Amarnath is suffering from Alzheimer's and has lost coherence of speech and movement. As Bipasha awakes the next morning, she has to face the pangs of reality. How long can she give refuge to this old man ? She stays alone, a call girl by profession operating in posh hotels and resorts, an identity she has managed to conceal from her neighbors who have a nagging suspicion about her profession but no proof to support their hunch. At most, Bipasha can give refuge to Amarnath for the next four days because she does not operate during the Durga Pujas, a principle to which she sticks ever since she joined the profession. Bipasha's client mediator, Ajit offers a solution. He knows a young doctor who has recently returned from America and set up a clinic for patients like Amarnath. The doctor, Aniket comes over and seems quite interested to find such a case. In the span of four days, a rather curious relationship develops between Amarnath, Bipasha and Aniket. As the doctor begins to diagnose the nature of ailment the patient is suffering, Bipasha's tryst with Aniket is her first experience of staying in the company of a person who is not her client. And just when Bipasha is out to discover unexplored arenas of her own self, Amarnath disappears suddenly leaving the exploration unfinished. But does that mean an unfinished finale for Bipasha and Aniket ?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047453</url></doc>
