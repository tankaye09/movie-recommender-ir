<plot>"Two children sleeping in bed are aroused by a burglar, who foolishly lays down his revolver while he is ransacking the room. One of the little girls gets possession of the pistol, and makes the thief throw up his hands. The other little girl rings the burglar alarm for a policeman, who shortly appears, arrests the burglar and marches him off. This is a very attractive subject, and especially pleasing to children."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097003</url></doc>
