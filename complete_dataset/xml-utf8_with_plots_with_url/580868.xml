<plot>On the evening of April 23rd, 2006, Emmy award-winning Reed Cowan was the on-call reporter for Salt Lake City's affiliate KTVX. That Sunday night, he was paged to the scene of a child's hanging. When he rushed to the street where the news scene played out, he found the nightmare he was paged to report on, was his own. Cowan's four year old son Wesley had fallen from a horizontal set of monkey bars in to the path of a trapeze, dying instantly. As Cowan wailed in grief, cameras were rolling. It was in that gut-wrenching moment that Reed Cowan went from reporting the news to being the news. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LENS opens up the most raw and personal feelings of a TV news reporter conflicted by the realities of sensationalized TV news and the feelings of a father tortured by his son's brutal death. The film follows Reed Cowan over a two-year period of self-exploration, self-documentation and self-liberation as he and others work to save the lives of children caught up in Kenya's 2008 post-election violence and ethnic cleaning. Brave, bold and brutal, this film shows the life and evolution of a journalist, a father and en emerging humanitarian.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580868</url></doc>
