<plot>Fortysomething adolescent, Simon, has an unwelcome visitor. Talia, his lawyer ex-wife, has come to inform him that it's time to grow up and take responsibility for their teenage daughter Arwen. That, or she'll be contacting the Child Support Agency. Which leaves him only a week to seduce his brand new lodger, Isabel. And Arwen is supposed to be having her room. Then there's the usual problem of Krystof, Mr. Morality, kicking off about it all. Only disaster can result. It does.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521177</url></doc>
