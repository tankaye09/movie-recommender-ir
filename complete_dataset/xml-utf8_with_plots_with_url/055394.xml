<plot>Ssgt. Daniel Gilyeat; U.S.M.C., an Iraq War Veteran amputee, became a recipient of an Extreme Home Makeover in February 2008. Afterwards, his friends decided to do the same for his motorcycle, which he was no longer able to ride. Danny speaks of his encounter with the I.E.D. that blew his leg off, as well as his career. The motorcycle fabricators show how they took a $1,000 Harley Sportster and transform it into an elegant work of art, complete with a hand grenade shifter to accommodate his missing leg.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055394</url></doc>
