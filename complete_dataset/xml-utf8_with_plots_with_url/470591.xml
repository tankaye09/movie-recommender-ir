<plot>Dealing with the loss of his mother and his father's increasingly distant relationship, eight-year old Noah decides to go on a journey to find all things once familiar to him. With a dresser drawer full of his favorite things, not to mention a zip lock bag of dill pickles, Noah sets foot out onto the open road. His father, John, quickly catches up, and as Noah finds what he's looking for, he reminds John that memories of love are never forgotten.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470591</url></doc>
