<plot>From the Papal pimp who put brothels in the Vatican to the latest exploits of Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss this 3 part series lifts the lid on the 'worlds oldest profession'. In 'Prostitution' Lucy Moore presents a kaleidoscope of history spanning over 4,000 years on a journey that takes her from the Red Light districts of the ancient world to modern day streets of Soho and Amsterdam. In a series full of surprises, the programmes will show how this ancient trade has not only reflected, our sexual habits, moral outlook and attitudes to women but has helped to shape the world we live in. The prostitutes lot has been constantly shifting - over time whores and harlots have been elevated, abused, exploited and commodified . But as Lucy discovers , it's a surprisingly resilient profession that has defeated all attempts to suppress and control it. We live in a world which seems to be ever more tolerant of prostitution but increasingly concerned about exploitation and the series will explore how far we have or haven't come over the centuries.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241538</url></doc>
