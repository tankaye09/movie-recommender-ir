<plot>Akhtar Hussain saves the life of Nawab Salim, and earns his gratitude. Salim invites Akhtar to come to his palatial home, and Akhtar does so. On the way, he meets beautiful Saltanat, and falls in love with her. On arrival at Salim's house, Akhtar is treated with utmost respect, provided employment, and a place to live. Akhtar meets with Saltanat and both plan to get married. Unknown to them, Salim also loves Saltanat, but Saltanat rejects his advances, and proposal, leaving his heartbroken. Soon Saltanat and Akhtar get married and settle down. Saltanat soon gives birth to a son. Salim is very affectionate with this child, and the child too grows to like Salim. Akhtar, meanwhile, has fallen in bad company, drinks alcohol, and romances a courtesan. When Saltanat finds out about this affair, she is outraged, and asks Akhtar to improve, but instead Akhtar divorces her, leaving her and her child alone, homeless, and nowhere to turn to. Salim offers to assist her, but Saltanat thinks that Salim is to blame for the current situation, as he may have had a hand in bringing ruin upon herself and Akhtar just to get even for her not marrying him. Only time will tell who the real culprit, as the drama slowly unfolds over the years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366359</url></doc>
