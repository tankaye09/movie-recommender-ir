Soon this duplicity becomes a way of life for Diane: a young, intelligent woman whose lies are stacking up to haunt her. Diane's chances of being found out increase with every near-miss. When the questions come, she looks destined to lose just about everything...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066370</url></doc>
