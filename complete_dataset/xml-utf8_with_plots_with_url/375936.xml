<plot>The young boy Jacques is very much afraid of the dark basement. In his very lively imagination monsters are waiting for him there. To make it even worse the monster is accompanied by Monsieur Noir, a dark, sinister character that gives Jacques' fear a face. Through him it becomes tangible and at the same time it grows bigger and menacing ... almost insurmountable. Almost. As Jacques and the audience will learn, certain fears only exist in one's head and can therefore be overcome.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375936</url></doc>
