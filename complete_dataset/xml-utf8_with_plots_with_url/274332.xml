<plot>Mann Kapoor lives a middle-class lifestyle in India. He wants to be a singer but is unable to secure any firm to back him up. He would like to be represented by Umesh Jumani, the Managing Director of a recording company, and in order to do this he successfully woos his attractive daughter, Radha, gets her to fall in love with him, and in this way secures a contract to make an album with her dad's company. His friends arrange for a bachelor party in scenic Goa, and while partying he meets with and falls head over heels in love with Roma Fernandes, also an upcoming singer and dancer. Roma also falls in love with him, but is heart-broken when she finds out that he is to wed Radha. Torn between his love for Roma and the commitment he made with Radha, a lovelorn Mann returns home - not knowing that fate will disrupt his life when Radha and Umesh eventually find out that he has been two-timing Radha, and a confrontation with an underworld don, Chappu Bhai, who wants to ensure that Mann keeps his promise to Roma and weds her at any and all costs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274332</url></doc>
