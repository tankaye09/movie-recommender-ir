<plot>Chantu and Bantu are unemployed, and are able to get any employment due to lack of experience. They come across an advertisement for hotel management trainees in Goa, and make their way there. Once there, they hoodwink the trainer by posing as the nephew of the owner of the hotel, and thus enroll themselves in the training course. They set about making enemies by exposing several employees and guests, and earning their wrath, and in the process end up wooing the daughters of the two owners of the hotel. Things turn sore for the two, when the guests and former employees get together to avenge their humiliation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662462</url></doc>
