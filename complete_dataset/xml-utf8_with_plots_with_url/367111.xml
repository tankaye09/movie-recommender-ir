<plot>This surreal comedy makes effective use of pixilation (live action stop-motion animation) in the story of an everyday man who finds unusual ways of spending his time while riding in an apartment elevator. He discovers that he can remove and re-tie his shoes in the time it takes to travel to the ground floor. Meeting self-imposed challenges that include undressing and dressing in the space of nine floors, he conjures up more and more feats to accomplish during his daily trip. His secret life transforms his existence from banality to oblivion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?367111</url></doc>
