<plot>A young man and his girl are seated in a garden, and if one is to judge from the wistful look on their faces, the fond embraces and kisses that are exchanged, they are making love. The day is warm, and the young man, much to the disgust of his girl, finally goes to sleep, whereupon she deserts him. Two other young men, who are walking through the garden, grasp the situation, and hurrying off, they return with a donkey. The donkey is led up to the sleeper, and its head is rested upon the young man's shoulder. A few nudges from the mischief makers and the sleeper suddenly awakes. In his half sleeping condition, he fancies the donkey is his young lady whom he left by his side, and he rapturously throws both arms around the donkey's neck. Upon his discovering the facts in the case, the trouble begins. Very comical.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572911</url></doc>
