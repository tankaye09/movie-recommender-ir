<plot>This DVD features Rick Wakeman in an up-close and uproarious stand-up performance filmed live in front of a studio audience. The 'Grumpy' rock legend, composer and raconteur exposes a host of hilarious anecdotes and unknown escapades experienced during his career, including the first rehearsals with Yes, his multi-marital life, amusing recording session memories, his exposure in a Japanese toilet, and more. Wakeman also explains his version of the X-factor and brings to life the lost chord in the Yes classic And You and I. This brand new show also features classic material from The Strawbs, Yes and his hit solo albums performed on the Grand Piano.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580855</url></doc>
