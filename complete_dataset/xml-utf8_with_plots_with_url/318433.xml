Getting habitual of visiting brothels, Kundan gets attracted to Gulabbai (Aruna Irani), and wants to marry her, much to the anger of the brothel madame, Ratnabai (Chand Usmani). Rajesh is another of Kundan's friend, and his father's employee, he is of good and sober habits, but Kundan generally ignores and mocks him. Rajesh meets with Kamini (Zarina Wahab), the only daughter of a very wealthy man, Shankerlal (Pradeep Kumar), and both eventually fall in love. Kamini's stemp-mother wants her to marry Ajit, and Shankerlal does not approve of Rajesh, for he knows that Rajesh's mother is a prostitute.
