<plot>First comes the fortunate miner who has accumulated a fortune. He is riding a mule and is followed by two others. One is carrying the gold, which is placed in sacks on one side and counterbalanced by heavy boxes on the other and the other mule is carrying household effects. In the background the village of Grand Forks is seen, through which many millions of dollars has passed during the last few years. The trail is in a deplorable condition. The pack train is first seen fording the flood on the trail, and then passes before the audience, the heads of the mules getting larger and larger. Very amusing and sure to cause a laugh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381170</url></doc>
