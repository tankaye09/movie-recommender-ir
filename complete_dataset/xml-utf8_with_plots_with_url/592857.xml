<plot>Hunting the stag is great sport and here we see it in full--the hounds chasing a noble stag through the water and woodlands until finally exhausted, the stag is run down and finally dispatched. A rope is tied around him and he is hauled out of the water where he fell and is drawn up on the bank where he is viewed by a large number of persons gathered to see him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592857</url></doc>
