<plot>The Empty Room Club is a black comedy about three best friends, Laena, Mckenzie and Dana, who after being snowed in, are forced with no other option but to open up to each other to save themselves from boredom. They all have their own problems that seem to occupy their daily thoughts: Laena with work, Dana with school and McKenzie with the alienation from her other two friends. McKenzie opens up about her depression, and as both Laena and Dana try to help McKenzie with her problem, they find themselves too busy talking about they're own problems then to actually listen. Though you may think the room is full, its actually empty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555260</url></doc>
