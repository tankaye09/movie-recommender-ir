<plot>An examination of the craft of 'Marlon Brando' (qv), narrated by professionals of the film industry. The film follows his career from the stage with "A Streetcar Named Desire", through the Actors Studio and professional relationships with 'Elia Kazan' (qv) and 'Stella Adler' (qv) to Hollywood. An actor who redefined the limits to which a professional may go in becoming the character not only intellectually but emotionally, Brando changed the meaning of film acting. Bedeviled by personal tragedy (a murder charge to his son Christian) and a serious late career weight problem, Brando remains a towering figure in American film history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?358849</url></doc>
