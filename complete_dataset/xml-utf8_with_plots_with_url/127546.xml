<plot>The film is about a stripper (Nikki) with a disruptive past who turns a college super-star, who is a favorite to win the Heisman trophy (Korey), life up-side down. He finds himself in a predicament which can cost him his career, his family and his life. The person he least expects to intervene is his cousin, a neighborhood street thug who also learns that the beef he's inherited from his cousin, may also hold the truth of his brothers death. As if that wasn't enough, the story has another sub-plot regarding Korey's younger sister (named Darling, hence the movie title Darling Nikki) growing up to become a woman, yet moving more towards the road of sex, liquor and resentment. All stemming from the death of her mother and her father's involvement with his present fianc√©e.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127546</url></doc>
