<plot>As a promotion of their new "ice beer" Molson sponsored a promotional event, the "Polar Beach Party", on the shore of the Arctic Ocean. 500 contest winners, across North America, would be Molson's guests for a private rock concert featuring free beer, and a lineup of big rock bands. The combined visitors, gate-crashers, bands, roadies and Molson hosts were comparable in number to the citizens of Tuktoyaktuk. Tuktoyaktuk is a "dry" community. The visitors were insensitive. The film crew captured these tensions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267859</url></doc>
