<plot>A divorced father has been invited by his ex-wife to attend their 8 yrs old daughter's birthday party. The presence of the ex-wife's new man in her life at the party causes an argument, which escalates into a physical fight and ultimately multiple homicides. Only one man escapes the massacre and tells the story of what exactly happened at the party. He gives enough evidence to support his innocence. Is he a psycho killer or innocent sole survivor of the whole tragedy? "Instant Aggression" is full of emotional ups and downs of a family with surprise twists, making for a poignant depiction of the life of a divorced husband and a loving father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266500</url></doc>
