<plot>"Betty I Am", an inner city Dark Comedy and character piece, is set within the burrows of East Los Angeles. A brother and sister reunite following a five-year hiatus and are forced to stumble towards reconciliation. Paul, a drunken vagrant, finds only awkward inconvenience as Betty is unwittingly thrust into his care. Forced to contemplate the self-afflicted death of her father in solitude; Betty's naive optimism becomes sanctuary for both brother and sister. The realities of street existence have smashed Paul's resolve, and purpose now lies at the bottom of each dissolute liquor bottle. A middle-aged hooker provides the only model of feminine grace for the disgruntled twenty-five year old. Torn between her childhood ideals and the bleak reality of the present, Betty flails in the wake of her day-to-day indecision's. The state of Paul's indifference is tested and ultimately drained by the tenacity of her positive outlook. In the end, the two are given a chance to begin anew with a genuine potential for success.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066956</url></doc>
