<plot>Earl "Madman" Muntz was a well-known TV ad pitchman in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in oddball commercials for his various electronics and car businesses just after the Ed Sullivan show. He pioneered the same persona later used in the 1980s by Crazy Eddie, was friends with Bert Lahr and Dick Clark, married actress Joan Barton and model Patricia Stevens, and in his later years dated Phyllis Diller. This film is a documentary about the man and the legend, and includes interviews with those who knew him best as well as home movie footage filmed by Muntz himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351229</url></doc>
