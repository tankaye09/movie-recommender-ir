<plot>Dave has had what some might call a bad day. His best friend forced him to go on a date with a girl that doesn't quite seem to be his taste. Not to mention that a Vampire has just moved into town. The Vamp decides that he wants a pet Werewolf, choosing Dave. Fortunately for Dave, the Emo Vamp began reading his bad poetry halfway through the spell, letting Dave keep his free-will and control his transformations. Another side-effect? Dave knows he's in a movie now. So, Dave is going to have to learn how to control his new powers, get used to the camera that's always following him, and defeat the Emo Vamp to save his date. All while constantly punching through the Fourth Wall into your living room.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659747</url></doc>
