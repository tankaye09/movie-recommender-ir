<plot>After Jack Newman, a kind-hearted, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, suffers a stroke that damages the left side of his brain, he develops a supernatural ability to "remote view", that is, to mentally teleport himself to distant places he's been before. However, his condition is prone to hallucinations as well and when he "sees" his loving wife Sarah cheating on him, he must test to see if his visions are real or not. Tragedy strikes when his wife is murdered and he is the prime suspect. Now on the run, his journey becomes a violent descent into hell as he combines his skills as a journalist with his new power to attempt to clear his name and bring down the bad guys. Jack ultimately learns a hard truth; that nothing is what it seems and that seeing isn't necessarily believing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074869</url></doc>
