<plot>Barry, a rebellious teenager, tires of his family being around all the time, and wants to be left alone. They obliges him by leaving him home while they go away on a two-week camping trip. It is while they're gone that it dawns on Barry that feeding himself, washing himself and not turning the house into a toxic waste dump are a bit beyond his capabilities, and he realizes how much he misses having his family around.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204538</url></doc>
