<plot>"A most realistic picture full of life and action. The boys are seen rushing through fire and smoke in their desire to reach the enemy, who continue to retreat. A very exciting picture, and shows where Captain Capron and Sergeant Fish lost their lives. It also brings to mind the words of Colonel Wood, who, when the boys tried to appease their anger by swearing, said, 'Don't swear, boys, fight!'"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100073</url></doc>
