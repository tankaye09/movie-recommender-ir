<plot>This is the first of a series of cartoons featuring the near sighted Mister Magoo. He and his nephew, Waldo, are en route to a vacation at a lodge in the mountains and Waldo's banjo playing tends to be rather annoying for Magoo but a nearby grizzly bear is really interested in the banjo. When Waldo falls off a mountain ledge, the bear gets hold of the banjo and starts playing. Magoo is so near sighted, he doesn't know Waldo is gone and thinks the bear playing the banjo is Waldo. When they arrive at their lodge, Magoo and the bear get into more misadventures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453811</url></doc>
