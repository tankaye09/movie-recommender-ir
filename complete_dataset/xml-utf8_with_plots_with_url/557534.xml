It cuts to a Civil War battle scene showing the wounding of the son of writer Oliver Wendell Holmes. The elder Holmes sets out from New England to look for his son. Meanwhile, the son has been discharged from the hospital and takes refuge in a private home in Hagerstown, where he is nursed back to health by the young daughter of the family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557534</url></doc>
