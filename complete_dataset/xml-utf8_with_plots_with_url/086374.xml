<plot>Intelligence in India is seriously concerned over leaked reports of a massive terrorist attack on January 26th, Independence Day. They assign Agents Bobby and Arjun Singh to infiltrate the terrorists, known to be operating from Sofia, the Capital of Bulgaria. Bobby and Arjun accordingly accept this assignment, but Arjun quits when he finds out that Don Raja, a Bulgarian businessman, who had risen to power as a corrupt Nasik Police Inspector, may be the mastermind behind these terrorist attacks. After resigning, he decides to go after Don Raja on his own as he has a personal score to settle with him, with a bullet in his gun with Raja's name on it. But the wily Raja is way ahead of Arjun, he soon has him enmeshed in a web of lies and deceit, so much so that Arjun is unable to differentiate as to who is a terrorist, an Indian Agent, or an ordinary civilian, and soon Arjun is himself arrested by the Bulgarian police - as a terrorist suspect. It looks like Don Raja is going to have this way after all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086374</url></doc>
