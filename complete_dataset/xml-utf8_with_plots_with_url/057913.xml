<plot>In 1815, the Battle of Waterloo ended the Napoleonic age and restored the Bourbon monarchy to the throne of France. But the revolutionary spirit of 1789 refused to disappear, and the next decades saw France bitterly divided between conservative and revolutionary factions. This divided age produced some of the greatest achievements in French painting and literature. Dominating these achievements were the novels of Honore de Balzac, a French journalist and writer, who is regarded as one of the creators of realism in literature. Balzac's dream was to become a writer, and after publishing six novelettes entitled Scenes de la Vie Privee, he came up with the idea to create an amazing work of literature entitled La Comedie Humaine, which includes his masterpieces Le Pere Goriot, Les Illusions Perdues, Les Paysans, La Femme de Trente Ans, and Eugene Grandet. Although this major task was never completed, it was a unique achievement, and comprised of 90 novels and novellas and featured more than 2,000 characters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057913</url></doc>
