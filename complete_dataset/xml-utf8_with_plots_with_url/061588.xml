<plot>"The Prisoners" tells the story of a man who is wrongfully arrested and forced to remain in jail for years without being able to tell his story. Erdem is a family man with one kid, who is working as a hairdresser. One day he meets by chance his old friend, Ahmet and agrees to have a sit with him in a tea garden. However Ahmet is a drug dealer and his telephones are monitored by the police. This results in Erdem's being arrested in suspicion for his collaboration with Ahmet. How hopeless he tries, he could not convince anyone, even his wife, in his innocence. Meanwhile, his father's incarceration is concealed from Erdem's son Ali. In his child's dream world, Ali imagines his father as a commander chosen to protect the world from alien invasion. The prisoners staying in Erdem's ward will all commit to this game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061588</url></doc>
