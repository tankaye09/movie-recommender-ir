<plot>Explores the nature of man, not only with feet of clay, but with a face of clay as well. Within a colorless city of walls, corridors, and small rooms, a man makes his way from home to work, then to a bar, and then, by a stroke of luck, into an outdoors of space, fresh air, and color. Along the way, he changes his face to fit his surroundings, interacts with his dog, argues with co-workers, and gossips at a bar. His altering of his visage suggests a two-faced nature, and his stepping into the outdoors provides the ultimate test of his real identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256271</url></doc>
