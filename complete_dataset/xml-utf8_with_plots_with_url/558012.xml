<plot>9-year-old Pedro's reluctant journey through elementary school in pursuit of the American Dream, which he describes as a "nightmare." Misbehaving and failing at school, Pedro becomes isolated from other children and tries to befriend unsuspecting animals he encounters along his way. Told from Pedro's point of view, as only a child could, this idiosyncratic documentary enters the subjective universe of a Mexican immigrant boy at odds with the new country around him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558012</url></doc>
