<plot>In career spanning nearly 20 years, from 1972-1991, Scottish film-maker Bill Douglas only made 4 films - and three of those were shorts. And yet he was highly acclaimed, winning the Silver Bear at Venice for his first film, garnering praise from the likes of Lindsay Anderson, Francois Truffaut and Satyjit Ray, and picking up the Independent's 'film of the year award' for COMRADES in 1987. This documentary explores Bill Douglas's struggle from childhood poverty to acclaimed director. A remarkable man.
