<plot>Tom and Jerry are aboard a train making its way up a mountain in the Swiss Alps. When their train breaks down, they're spotted by a very thin St. Bernard, who brings the engine some liquor. The engine zips through the Alps, but leaves the pair behind. They play their horn, which is answered by a herd of goats, who boot Tom and Jerry down the mountain. They find a group of yodelers on the side of another mountain, and are then lured to a Swiss chalet by one of them using some Swiss cheese on a string. When the locals get angry, Tom and Jerry try to appease them by yodeling, playing instruments and dancing. They then steal some Swiss cheese, which makes them both holey; mice, mistaking them for cheese, chase them down the mountain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016793</url></doc>
