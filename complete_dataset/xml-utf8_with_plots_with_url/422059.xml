<plot>One of the most interesting sights in the vicinity of Niagara Falls is the Whirlpool Rapids, where the immense volume of water which passes over the Falls speeds along through its rocky and tortuous passage towards the ocean. In taking the picture the camera was placed at the front end of a train ascending the grade at a rapid rate. The motion of the train in one direction and the water in the opposite direction, the latter impeded and interrupted in its course by the rocky path through which it flows, sending beautiful masses of spray and foam many feet in the air, makes a lasting impression. Sold complete or in separate lengths.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422059</url></doc>
