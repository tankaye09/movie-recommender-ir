<plot>Locked in a fierce battle with Venomark, the Rangers are bitten by the venomous mutant...except for Wes, the Red Ranger, who runs to his father's lab for the antitoxin. Saved by the serum, the Rangers, Q-Rex and Shadow Force Blue defeat the vicious Venomark. Jen, warns Wes that his Dad's serum must be destroyed or the future could be in danger of shifting. But Mr. Collins refuses. It's too profitable to give up, he says. Desperate for the antivenom, Ransik and his mutant Severax attack Bio-Lab and unbeknownst to Wes, they severely injure his father. Suddenly, a mysterious figure from the future appears and the Rangers are stunned to see it's Alex, the original Red Ranger. They thought he was dead-killed by Ransik. The future has shifted, he says, and he has been sent back to fix it. He tells Wes that his father has been injured and soon he will die. At the hospital, Wes reluctantly promises his father that he will take over the lab while Alex replaces Wes as head Ranger. Meanwhile, Frax sends his robot Dragontron to attack the city. With Shadow Force Blue and Q-Rex, the Rangers fight off the robot, but their team isn't the same without Wes. Dragontron returns and the Rangers use their Megazords to fight, but they're overpowered. Will Wes return? The answers lie within.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?441250</url></doc>
