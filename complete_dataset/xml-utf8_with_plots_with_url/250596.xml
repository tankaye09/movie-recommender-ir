<plot>Film maker Daniel Korb mixes Spinal Tap and Planet of the Apes to create a world where humans are owned by monkeys, and do their jobs, not because they make creative decisions, but because they get treats. The star of Hurdy Gurdy is Jerry. To the viewing audience, Jerry appears to be an average organ grinder monkey. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that Jerry is not owned by the three men with whom he lives; he owns and employs them! Two of his protégé, Bobo and Harpo, constantly vie for Jerry's affection and praise. They live and work to please their master. The third man Jerry owns, Buster, was won in a game of blackjack at an age too old to train. While pretending to document the life and times of an alcoholic organ grinder monkey, this film sees human nature at both its best and worst.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250596</url></doc>
