<plot>Call Me A Paki gives a glimpse of the filmmaker's personal growth brought about by his first experience with racism upon returning to Canada after living in Pakistan for 17 years. The realization that he was not accepted in this society quickly lead to the abandonment of the cultural and spiritual values and practices that were once an integral part of his life. It took the hauntingly insightful words of a virtual stranger on the streets of Northern Pakistan to make him realize all he had given up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091086</url></doc>
