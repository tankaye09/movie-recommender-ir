<plot>Kate Wyler is an automotive engineer, who is married to Jim, a veterinarian. She is currently working on a project for Victor Modrian. It appears that his wife Estelle doesn't like the attention that he is giving Kate and the way that he is handling the business. One day Victor is killed, and evidence points to Kate. The most damaging evidence appears to be surveillance photo that shows Kate buying the gun that killed Victor. Kate is convicted. Later Jim discovers a homeless woman who is a dead ringer for Kate. It then dawns on Jim that this woman was probably the one who posed as Kate in the surveillance photo. He then also discovers that Estelle's behind the whole thing. But with no evidence or witness or to back his story, Jim breaks Kate out and together they try the girl who posed as Kate, while not only staying ahead of the law but of Estelle to who is trying to either get rid of the girl or them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246603</url></doc>
