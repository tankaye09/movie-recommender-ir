<plot>Enter Buddy Flavenoid, a writer/director of 1950's Hollywood horror B films who is not all that stable. After an actor from his latest movie "Attack of the Atomic Reptiles" tries to get him fired, Buddy is determined to see his project through by killing him with a baseball bat to the head. Unfortunately his homicidal ambition was not enough to save his movie from dying at the box office. Several years later a mysterious investor appears and wants to finance and produce another Buddy Flavinoid film "Attack of the Slime People." Buddy, who has sunk to being a bathroom attendant, is back and is more determined than ever to make HIS film HIS way and those that try to interfere with his vision are once again dispatched with the help of his trusted Louisville slugger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?050453</url></doc>
