<plot>Ganga lives a poor lifestyle in Sundergarh along with her dad, a school-teacher, and mom. Sundergarh and the region are being terrorized by a bandit named Jaam Singh, who frequently raids the village, abducts and sexually molests women, and the police are unable to stop him. Inspector Jagjit Singh did attempt to do so, even arrested him, and got Ganga's dad to come forward to testify, but Jaam's men helped him escape and killed Jagjit. Jaam then kills Ganga's dad and mom on her wedding day and abducts her, but Ganga manages and runs into the car of Mahaarani a Eunuch brothel-keeper, who takes her in, looks after her, agrees to protect her, while she must, in turn, be a dancing courtesan. But Jaam is unable to get his mind off of Ganga and decides to abduct her and teach Mahaarani a lesson which he/she will never forget.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352334</url></doc>
