<plot>Jeff Wincott is Roger McCalister, a Vietnam veteran with an attitude and a Harley. He's an unwelcome prodigal son who returns to his hometown only to find his mother recently passed away. All seems hopeless for Roger until he meets Romona, a beautiful but unlikely candidate for the affairs of the heart. The trials and tribulations of family relations and love unfold in a mystical fashion when Eve, Roger's rich eccentric cousin intervenes and attempts to unite the two who eventually find their destiny as a couple.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654310</url></doc>
