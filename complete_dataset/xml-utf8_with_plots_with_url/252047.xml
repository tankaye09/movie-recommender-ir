<plot>The short story I am the Man!!! revolves around a young couple trying to conceive a child. Lester and Marilyn Carter desperately love each other but with the pressure they are putting on themselves, something has to give. Lester feels this is the month but when he learns that Marilyn is still not pregnant, his world crashes in. He has tried prayers, books, yoga; you name it and still no luck. Desperate, he swallows his pride and calls his best friend Mark for advice. Mark agrees to help, providing dinner is served. While Marilyn is off preparing dinner, Mark and Lester huddle. The key, according to Mark is...rhythm. Lester, embarrassed, tries to understand. When he doesn't, Mark leads him into the "Rump Shaker" dance. Slowly, Lester starts to "get it" and his confidence soars. Practically throwing Mark out, Lester is confident he is ready to be "the man!"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252047</url></doc>
