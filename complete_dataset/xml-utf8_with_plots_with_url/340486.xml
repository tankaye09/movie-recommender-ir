<plot>On a lonely road in California's high desert, a young woman is summarily tossed from the cab of a pickup by her angry boyfriend. As he drives away, he dumps out her few belongings. She's Lola, with a black eye, heroin and nicotine addictions, jobs in pornographic movies, and a future, she says, of no thanks and three strikes. A drifter appears who sells insurance and quotes Robert Frost. After an initial wariness, Lola tells her story and the drifter offers some advice. What's next for Lola? Can she take another road?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340486</url></doc>
