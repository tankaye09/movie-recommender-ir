<plot>Sharda is in love with a young man who wants to marry her. Before the marriage could take place, some of his friends force themselves upon Sharda, leaving her pregnant. When her boyfriend does not show up, she decides to keep the child, names her Swati, re-locates to a small town in Southern India and finds employment as a nurse with Dr. Rajendra. Years later Swati has grown up to be an assertive young woman, who is not only outspoken but quite capable of physically defending herself, but her attitude alienates her and Sharda from the community in general. She befriends Ram Mohan, an activist, who is often in trouble with the police. With no one to look after her mother after she gets married, Swati asks Rajendra, now a widower, to marry Sharda, to which he agrees. The marriage takes place, and both move in to live a wealthy lifestyle with Rajendra and his daughter, Anandi. Rajendra and Sharda decide to find a suitable groom for Swati, but before that could happen Swati and Anandi have a confrontation, things escalate to such an extent that Sharda disowns Swati and she moves out, while Anandi's marriage is being arranged with Prasad Chiranjivi Gupta. But Sharda's troubles with Swati are far from over - as Swati will soon return back into her life - with time with her long-last boyfriend, and Swati's biological father - turning Sharda's life upside down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?524734</url></doc>
