<plot>Jared is enjoying an ordinary night out with his sister Ashley when a phone call changes their entire night. Their nine year old sister Casey was being rushed to the hospital after getting hit by a car. As Jared and Ashley wait at home, the stress, worry, and frustration begin to set in as they wait by the phone for updates from their mother. With each other by their side, the two are stuck in their kitchen waiting, because that is the only thing they can do. Wait. This film shows when tragedy strikes a loved one how it affects the people that love them and that in the end, only time can really tell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518951</url></doc>
