<plot>This story follows Nick, a young man who is nervously awaiting his wedding. His bride-to-be Lauren was accidentally impregnated during a party while they were both intoxicated. His brother and best friend stand over him reminding him that marrying Lauren out of necessity is not a smart choice. However, Nick fully believes he is in love with her, and wants to grow up. The story takes us through this crisis, and eventual redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392050</url></doc>
