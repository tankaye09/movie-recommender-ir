<plot>This CD/DVD package contains Jason Hook's solo CD "Safety Dunce" as well as the DVD "The Making of Safety Dunce". Hook has toured with Vince Neil and Alice Cooper. On this instrumental effort, he creates hard, angry and nasty compositions alongside Jeremy Spencer (Five Finger Death Punch) on drums and Marty O'Brien (Methods of Mayhem) on bass. DVD: Follow Jason Hook through some hilarious moments during the making of his solo CD "Safety Dunce" Highlights include candid interviews with Jason Hook, Jeremy Spencer (drums) Jamie Talbot (Manager) and a few random female friends - who, when prodded, reveal a little more than they every intended to!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274189</url></doc>
