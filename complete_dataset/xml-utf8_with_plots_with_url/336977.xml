<plot>This DVD captures - in two versions, Original and Remix - Limp Bizkit's performance at Germany's biggest and most prestigious rock event, held annually in Nuremberg, the famous Rock In The Park Festival in June of 2001, when they were pretty much at the height of their popularity. In this blinding set the band performed all their classic numbers and featured four of their Top Twenty hit singles, including Take A Look Around, the theme song to the blockbuster movie Mission Impossible 2, My Way and the chart-topping Rollin'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336977</url></doc>
