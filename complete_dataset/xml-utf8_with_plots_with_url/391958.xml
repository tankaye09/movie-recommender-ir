<plot>Neba draws the portrait of Mamadou Touré who comes back home, looking for his roots. This documentary concerns on this young man living in France and in Mali: both home ports between which ones his own identity is pulled about. NéBa, 'my mother' in language Bambara, is a story of family, a mother who wants to revise its son and a son who wants to bury his father. A story of immigration which transforms into tragedy by the force of laws. It is also the history of a friendship between an alien who returns to the country after eight unsatisfied quest years in Europe and a French who dreams Africa as the paradise lost. A film, a trip on traces of the journey which had behaved Mamadou Touré to cross a part of Africa and Europe to arrive until to France.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391958</url></doc>
