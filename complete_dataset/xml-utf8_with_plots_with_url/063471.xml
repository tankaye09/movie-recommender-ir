<plot>George wants to ask Mildred to the community dance. However, George has never been on a date before. Not only that, but George is rather short--let's face it, he's a runt--and Mildred is much taller than he is. The high school swimming coach gives George advice on how to handle himself on the date by comparing a first date to a first swimming meet. George, much like the viewer, doesn't get that comparison, either. In any case, we follow George and Mildred as they each prepare for and eventually go out on their date.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063471</url></doc>
