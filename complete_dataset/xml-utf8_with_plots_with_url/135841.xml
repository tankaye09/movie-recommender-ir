<plot>Casting out demons is a practice that seems more at home in the middle ages rather than the 21st century, however it still goes on today. The Church of England has a resource for it within most regions. The ministers involved talk about their experiences with the supernatural and how they became convinced of the existence of demons before becoming involved in the specific ministry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135841</url></doc>
