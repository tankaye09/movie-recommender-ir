<plot>The Treadwell Mine, situated on Douglas Island, Alaska, is the largest gold mine in the world. With an inexhaustible supply of ore, it has produced millions of dollars annually, and will continue to do so for years. The view shows men running to seek shelter from flying debris, then the masses of rock hurled out from across what is known as the "Glory Hole," which is an excavation a mile square and a quarter of a mile deep.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074306</url></doc>
