<plot>When husband Andy's photography appears on the cover of Blush's new record Animal Extinct, Melissa French, "Mel" is more than a little curious about the brash, young pop star and her sexy world of rock and roll, and although loath to admit it, more than a little jealous of Andy's success. After all, she was the one that was supposed to become the artist. With French Furniture Brokers in a slump, it is certainly no time to think about leaving, and besides, where would she even go? But when Mel meets Anna Gustafsson, the ing√©nue assistant to her new clients, she suddenly finds a renewed interest in her work. Could she really be in love with a twenty-one-year old Swedish girl? If not, then why is she dreaming about kissing her? As another birthday fast approaches, Mel's life slowly spins out of control and her sexuality emerges on its own, in a dreamy adventure to the land of the midnight sun for a chance to profess her forbidden love to Anna. But when she becomes entangled with a sexy, rock and roll nurse hiding a dark secret of her own, Mel's sexual fantasy quickly turns into a nightmare of epic proportion, bringing her face to face with her own prejudice and fear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353242</url></doc>
