<plot>Donna and Becky are a family, with a family business. Donna is a cop, Becky has a business degree. With help from Donna's son Justin, they operate Trauma Scene Restoration, in metropolitan Philadelphia, cleaning up blood and gore at the scene of homicides, suicides, and accidents. Becky describes the idea for the business ("You just lost somebody you love, and you've got to get on your hands and knees and clean them up?"), some of the challenges ("Brain tissue gets very gummy"), the tools such as steaming machines, and the fears, as of hepatitis B. At the film's end, sitting with their dog Blitzie, they talk about marriage, Barbra Streisand, and being a couple.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188926</url></doc>
