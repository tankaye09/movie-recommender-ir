<plot>Once upon a time, cloaked in her favored red hood, Little Red Cap set off to Grandmother. But soon she was drawn away from the designated path by what the surrounding woods had to offer - mysteries, beauty and the Wolf. Red, now a 40 year old woman, still bears the same fears, guilt and anger as she remembers the day her life changed. Creating a new red hood for her daughter, she must now make the ultimate choice as to whether or not to pass on her identity and in turn her fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458104</url></doc>
