<plot>More people than ever are turning their backs on traditional ways of living and taking to the water as a choice of lifestyle. Buying and living aboard a narrowboat is one such choice, one that is proving an attractive way of living to thousands of people all over the country. This programme will look in detail at the differences between traditional and contemporary narrowboats and examine some of the basics one needs to consider before buying a boat. From construction and design to decoration, from types of mooring to maintenance and supplies, all aspects of owning a narrowboat are looked at, many in the company of the people who really know, narrowboat owners themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011259</url></doc>
