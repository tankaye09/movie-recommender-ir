<plot>Unable to sleep, Deah enjoys the peaceful quiet as the sun rises. In the nursery, her husband, Jason, awakes with their infant daughter Rose announcing to the world that she is hungry. After hunting throughout the house, Jason finds Deah curled up in a chair and hands her the wailing babe as he dresses to go for a run. She struggles unsuccessfully to nurse Rose. When Jason sees this, he prepares a bottle of formula, which Deah reluctantly takes, then he is off for his daily run in preparation for his next marathon. Once alone, she must face her inability to connect with her daughter, her feelings of failure as a mother. And with one final decision, Deah realizes what she must do to save her baby and herself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197731</url></doc>
