<plot>The U.S. Life Saving Service had an exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition demonstrating the use of the breeches buoy in saving the lives of shipwrecked mariners. A mast is erected in the middle of the lake at the Pan-American Exposition, and by means of a mortar, a line is thrown over the mast head. The breeches buoy rigging is hauled out by the sailor on the mast and the rigging made fast to the shore. The line is then stretched and the buoy is rapidly run out by the life savers, and the man is safely hauled in and landed. A remarkable and life-like demonstration of this wonderful invention.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660810</url></doc>
