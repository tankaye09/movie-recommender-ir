<plot>Grandpa Chatterji is a comedy drama about a second generation Indian family living in the UK. Neetu and her brother Sanjay have a very strict and conventional grandfather - Grandpa Leicester - who makes their lives a misery by insisting on good manners, formal clothes and horrible food. But when their mother's father - Grandpa Chatterji - flies over from India to stay with them, their ideas about grandfathers are radically challenged. Grandpa Chatterji is eccentric, mystical and mad about cooking: he also appears to have magical powers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221799</url></doc>
