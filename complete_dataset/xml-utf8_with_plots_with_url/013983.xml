<plot>In the city of Compton, everybody has a secret...but every secret has its price. ZION, 18, just arrived home from college for Christmas break and has one night to consummate his newly formed relationship with LANISE BELL, 16 who became the smartest, finest, and "freakiest" girl at his high school alma mater after she lost 75 pounds this past summer at fat camp. Lanise has spent the last three months bragging about her sexual experiences. What Zion doesn't know is that Lanise is a virgin who talks big to get guys to notice her. Zion has one plan...make love to Lanise. Lanise's goal to not let that happen - at least until she can get the experience she claimed to have. Zion's love making plans are continually interrupted by his cronies, Lanise's seemingly uninvited friends, his nosey big sister and cracked out homeless uncle, CRIPPLE JR. Six friends, one house, and one hell of a crazy night. A NIGHT IN COMPTON, explores relationships among a set of life long friends, in the spirit of Friday and The Breakfast Club.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013983</url></doc>
