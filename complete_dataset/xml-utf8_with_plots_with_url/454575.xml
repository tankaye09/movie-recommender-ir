<plot>Orphaned at a very young age, Raju and Radha are very close to each other. Radha takes care of the house, sells milk, paints dolls, etc. while Raju works in a mill. When the mill workers' union goes on strike, both of them start their own business of manufacturing and marketing toys. Soon they become rich. Raju would like Radha to get married to Advocate Ramesh Chandra so that he can marry his sister, Malti, but Radha has fallen in love with Anand, a man who had rescued her once, and would like to marry him. Raju gives his consent for both to get married, and they, together with Anand's sister, Nandini and her son, Kasturi, move into their palatial house. When Radha finds out that Raju lives Malti, she arranges his marriage with her and she too moves in with them. Soon misunderstandings start between Nandini, Malti and Radha, and as a result Raju and Malti leave the house. Then Raju gets a shock when he receives a letter from Radha's lawyer demanding half of the estate. By the looks of things it does appear that there is no more love lost between brother and sister, and their estate may be contested in a court of law - leaving nothing but bitterness and hatred on both sides.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454575</url></doc>
