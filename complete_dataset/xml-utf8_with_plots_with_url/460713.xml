<plot>Somewhere in Latin America, Colin and Tina live a quite life running a bar. But the relationship of the former pet shop owner and his glamorous wife has turned sour. Colin drinks away the profits while a resentful Tina does all the work. One night, an attractive young woman hangs around after the bar has closed, flattering Colin and plying him with booze. When this Stranger gets Colin onto the subject of what he was doing on Reptile Day - that day when all of the reptiles' heads exploded - Tina's suspicions are aroused. The Stranger drugs Colin and hypnotizes Tina, tying them to chairs. She has a lovely time torturing Colin, forcing him to reveal the truth about his illustrious past. Little by little we learn the story. How Colin first met Tina as she ripped off her clothes on the nightclub stage. How they were captured by Skink, the evil leader of the alien reptilians. And how Skink's attempts to drain their sexual energy to fuel his evil plans came to naught due to the power of their passion. Recounting the tale as once again they face danger, Colin's love for Tina is re-kindled. Colin and Tina escaped Skink, but surely this time they have met their match? Reptile Day puts actors into a cartoon world drawn by comic book genius D'Israeli, and uses a range of techniques to create a living cartoon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?460713</url></doc>
