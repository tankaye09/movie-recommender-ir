<plot>When a man's sleep is shattered by a startling noise, he tentatively gets up to investigate. He quickly finds himself in the middle of a series of paranormal events that culminate in him chasing a mysterious intruder through his house. But as the intruder continually stays one step ahead of him, it becomes unclear if he is chasing a man, a phantom, or his own fear. When the chase leads him out into his garage, he plays witness to a more terrifying awakening than he could have possibly imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263528</url></doc>
