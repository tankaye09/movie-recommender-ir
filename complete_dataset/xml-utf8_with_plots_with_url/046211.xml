<plot>Why was the Arrow project killed? Who ordered the destruction of the completed Arrows and why? These questions and more are explored in this thought provoking account of Canada's greatest aviation achievement. "ARROW... From Dream to Destruction" is a sequel to Aviation Videos Ltd. "AVRO ARROW...CF-105" produced in 1988. This 60 minute video has been produced from over 10 hours of original Avro Aircraft colour film footage and is the most detailed look at the whole Arrow program to date. Close to 90% of the scenes feature new Avro footage, much of it never before seen by the public. Coverage includes design, wind tunnel testing, free flight models, construction, ejector seat testing, roll out ceremonies, taxi trials, Arrow's first flight, and extensive coverage of the flight testing program. Superb historical footage of all five Arrows that flew. Also included is the Iroquois engine development, with B-47 engine test flights, and installation in Arrow 206. The Astra-Sparrow armament system, including actual Sparrow missile test launches is also featured.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046211</url></doc>
