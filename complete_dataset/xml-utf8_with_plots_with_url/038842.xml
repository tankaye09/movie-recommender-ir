<plot>Nallasivam (Kamal Haasan) and Anbarasu (Madhavan) are drawn together by the strigs of fate, since they come into contact at the Bhuvaneshwar airport. Anbarasu is an advertisement director, while Nallasivam is a trade unionist. Fate entwines their travel plans, and they end up travelling to Chennai together. In the course of their journey, Anbarasu, born with a golden spoon, is touched by the realities of the sufferings of a normal human being when he witnesses the injured during a train accident, and he volunteers to donate his blood, which is of a very rare group. The flashback of Nallasivam is recounted during one of their combined journeys. Nallasivam is a communit trade unionist, who fight for higher wages for his comrades. By chance, he falls in love with the daughter Bala(Kiran). Due to oppositions from Bala's father Padaiyacchi (Nasser), they plan to run away and get married, but unfortunately, Nallasivam meets with an accident which disfigures him. He is told by Padaiyacchi that Bala is married, so he pursues his communist agenda, during the course of which he meets Anbarasu. Anbarau is drawn to Nallasivam in the end, and claims him as his adopted brother, and forces Nallasivam to come to his wedding. Once at the wedding hall, kamal discovers teh bride to be none other than his sweetheart, Bala. When Padaiyacchi discovers him at the hall, his is in panic, and pleads for him to leave. Santhana Bharathy as Padaiyacchi's henchman plays out a sentimental scene in the end. The movie is more of a parallel cinema, with Kamal and Madhavan acting their roles to stellar effeciency. Kiran appears for a very small role, much to the disappointment of many.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038842</url></doc>
