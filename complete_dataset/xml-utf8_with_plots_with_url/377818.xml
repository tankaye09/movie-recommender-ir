<plot>A comic drama that examines how far a young couple from Ramle will go in order to save their house from confiscation. Beny and Esty love each other very much but they are unfortunate. One day, they find themselves unemployed, and if that's not enough, the bank is about to confiscate their apartment in a housing project, if they don't settle their mortgage debt within a month. The two search for creative solutions to obtain the money, while each of them believes that his solution is saner. As the confiscation date approaches, the relationship is marred, but their deep love holds in store a very precious surprise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377818</url></doc>
