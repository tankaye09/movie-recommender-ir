<plot>Kent, a realist who does not dream, is skeptical of those who do. At the end of a long relationship, and desperate for new friends, he seeks the advice of Ori, his mentor. Ori blames Kent's unhappiness on Kent's denial of his true nature. He tries to guide Kent by introducing him to three people who are friends and lucid dreamers. The dreamers, Ron, Charlene, and Jean, literally appear in each other's dreams, and share the same experiences in them. While Kent is entertained by their stories, he interprets the dreams as thinly disguised confessions and requests for help. Kent is in a position to help each of them, and does so willingly: He gives Ron, a struggling futures broker, 5 million dollars to trade; Charlene desires a political appointment. Kent throws a party for the Mayor, so they can meet; Jean needs love and support. They fall in love and he offers to marry her. One by one, the dreamers turn on Kent: When Kent's account vanishes, Ron believes he is being framed for money laundering; Charlene is humiliated when the Mayor denies ever meeting her; Jean feels betrayed when Kent stands her up on the eve of a dinner with her parents. Ori explains that he and Kent are a different breed from the three friends. They should tolerate people like that, but never truly accept them as equals. Kent ignores Ori's advice, and tries to reconcile, with disastrous results. After each one fully rejects Kent, Ron commits suicide in front of him, stating "I know what you are".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554056</url></doc>
