<plot>MTV wanted to keep up with the Reality Television Boom that began in the late 1990s, and therefore didn't want to show videos all day. So, in the summer of 1997, what it did instead was learn how to make videos feel like programs, to hold viewers even when a bad song came on, so the new show MTV Probe filmed kids, cinema verite-style, expounding about what videos mean to their lives. In one 35-second segment, a guy explains to his friend, "You can do anything to music. You can have sex. Drive a car. It's like when I fail a test at school: I come home, I play my music, I get in a really good mood." Many of these ideas came from M2, MTV 's all-video station, and MuchMusic, the Canadian equivalent of MTV. MuchMusic's window-lined Toronto studio inspired MTV's new Times Square set, which with its pool-playing and dart-throwing staff members shuffling around in the background, looks like your parents' basement if you didn't have parents. And, like the new MTV, the station broadcasts live and focuses on music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349367</url></doc>
