<plot>Genuine Pictures of the Ruined City of St. Pierre, Mt. Pelee Smoking, Fort de France and Other Historical Scenes Incidental to the Great Calamity. Our staff photographers returned from Martinique on the steamship "Korona," and brought with them a complete series of typical and genuine Martinique films, which, when exhibited in connection with our Mt. Pelee films, makes a complete entertainment in themselves. Our photographers were dispatched to the scene of the disaster immediately after the news reached this country, and during the following two months succeeded in procuring a set of motion picture negatives that are of extraordinary interest and rare photographic excellence. The panoramic views furnish the only adequate conception of the devastation and utter annihilation of everything animate and inanimate. Shows the wreckage along the ocean front, and how St. Pierre lies in a basin, with the ocean in front and the three other sides enclosed by high ridges, with Mt. Pelee looming up where the ridges converge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106953</url></doc>
