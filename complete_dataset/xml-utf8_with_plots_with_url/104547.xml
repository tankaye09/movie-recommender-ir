<plot>Fortunately, before his arrest Shyam manages to hide the diamonds at a nearby construction site, intending to return for it as soon as he gets out of prison. Two years pass and Shyam's release date arrives. Returning to his ill-gotten gains, he is horrified to discover that what was once a building site is now a new police headquarters with his stolen diamonds forming part of the foundation. Shyam decides to create and play the role of Inspector Ram and soon becomes the favourite of ACP Ranbir Singh (Paresh Rawal) at the police station. But life is not that easy going for the imposter who quickly comes to the attention of the ever suspicious Inspector Pande (Om Puri). Amidst all this mayhem Ram actually finds time to romance Inspector Ranjita (Bipasha Basu). But he also plays the character of Shyam with Ranbir's daughter, Komal (Shilpa Shetty). Soon they become lovers. Whilst Ram/ Shyam is busy with his hectic love life, other criminals, Tito (Ashish Vidhyarthi) and Tony (Rajat Bedi) have caught wind of the news and are now in search of the diamonds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104547</url></doc>
