<plot>The narrator states that even when a wife loves her husband, and even when he seems like the perfect husband on the surface, the wife often has to put up with some very annoying habits. Some of these common irritants are acted out by a husband and wife as the narrator provides a comic play by play. These annoying habits of husbands include using the guest towels in the bathroom, making a huge mess in the bathroom, failing to wake up when the alarm sounds, losing things and asking the wife to find them, not noticing the wife's new hat yet immediately admiring it when her attractive blonde friend tries it on, complaining about his wife's card playing abilities, and being unable to perform the simplest home repairs without causing more damage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252752</url></doc>
