<plot>The "Opposite Sex and the City" is a male tribute to and parody of the successful HBO series "Sex and the City". When Brad Caryshaw is asked to write an apology for one of his buddies who has committed the cardinal relationship sin, he comes face to face with his own etiquette demons when Miss Little forces him into a most rancid predicament. Brad is then forced to make a choice... Whether they stay together or not is beside the point; in the end Brad realizes that as long as he has his buddies everything will be just fine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?414858</url></doc>
