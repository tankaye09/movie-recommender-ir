<plot>Inspector Arjun is an honest and diligent police officer. He has an older step-brother named Bhishma, and a younger brother named Suraj. While Bhishma lives with their mother in the village, Arjun and Suraj live in the city. Suraj get's employed at a poultry farm, but finds out that this is just a front for drugs like cocaine. His attempts to get this information to the police and his brother are in vain, as he is captured by the owner of the poultry farm, who owe their allegiance to notorious gangster Dhaman Chamunda. When Dhaman comes to know about Suraj, he decides to teach Arjun and Bhishma a lesson - first by splitting them up over the property they own in the village, then by framing Bhishma for the death of Suraj. With anger and hostilities reigning high amongst the two remaining brothers, Dhaman and his men decide to take full advantage of this situation, and watch in glee as the two brothers go against each other, in a fight to the death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123728</url></doc>
