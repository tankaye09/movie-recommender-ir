<plot>After 30 years of a splendid career and exploring a variety of styles, Al Di Meola still ranks among the most popular guitar-masters of jazz and jazz-rock. Here, on his first "electric" DVD, Di Meola shows up with "Speak A Volcano" in Leverkusen in November 2006. Surrounded by a band including his old companion and superb percussionist Gumbo Ortiz, he rediscovers his love of the electric guitar without denying newer influences. The result is a balancing act between volcanic electronic ecstasy and emotionally moving sound excursions, between fervent improvisations and intimate conversations, including many compositions of Al Di Meola himself, and five Piazzolla tunes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?028028</url></doc>
