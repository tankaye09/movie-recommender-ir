<plot>The character in this picture is non-plussed. He is thwarted in every attempt to appear natural. When he sits down on a chair, the chair disappears and is next seen hanging on the wall "Upside Down." The table appears to be more at home on the ceiling than in its accustomed place. If our friend takes off his coat it returns to his person inside out. Everything is transposed and he rushes off in despair. Excruciatingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?633221</url></doc>
