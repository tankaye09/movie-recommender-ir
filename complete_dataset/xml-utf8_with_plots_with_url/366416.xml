<plot>When Frank and Cheryl Yale's infant son goes missing, the estranged couple is forced to face their worst fears and each other. Frank is a working guy whose affair with an office assistant - while Cheryl was 7 months pregnant - led to their break-up. It also led to Cheryl's emotional breakdown. Now they are stuck with only each other, and their past resentments, as the two revisit their relationship and try to unravel the painful mystery of their missing child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366416</url></doc>
