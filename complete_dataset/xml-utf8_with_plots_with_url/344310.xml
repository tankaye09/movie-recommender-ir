<plot>LOVE &amp; ORGASMS is a dramatic comedy about women's relationships that explores the emotional challenges of healing a broken heart and the importance of sexual pleasure for women. After a heartbreaking experience, advertising executive Donna Greenberg throws herself into her work. Not ready to pursue another relationship, she finds sex without the confines of commitment by purchasing a vibrator. Her new found secret pleasure begins to turn Donna into a new woman. However, she can't escape the mounting social pressure to find a man which results in the spontaneous creation of her new love, Bob Starr. Donna tells her best friend, Gina Perez, that this man is the image of perfection and is particularly skilled at giving her the pentacle of pleasure # the big O. Gina takes notice and reflects on an issue in her own longtime relationship. She deeply loves her man, however, Gina's never had an orgasm. The two friends are at odds about what makes life and relationships complete. The one problem that Donna doesn't reveal about Bob Starr is that he is actually her vibrator. Just when the sheets have been pulled over everyone's head, Donna and Bob are expected to attend Gina's engagement party. Donna strikes a deal with an unscrupulous co-worker to become Bob, and their collusion leads to chaos at the party. When fantasy collides with reality, two friends are forced to confront their issues about love and orgasms.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344310</url></doc>
