<plot>The role of the legendary Pancho Villa in the Mexican Revolution. Beginning at the end of the Revolution, Villa is at an outside dance party in Parral, when reporter Llergo and the photographer Sosa arrive to interview him. The next day, Villa shows them around his hacienda, which the government has given him and introduces them to his family. He tells the two men about the key moments from his past which he feels have marked his life, starting from 1910 with the beginning of the Mexican Revolution. Villa talks about his career and pivotal moments in his life, as well as his achievements and his relationship with Madero, whom he respected and admired. As he talks of Madero and his assassination he cries with sadness before taking us back to his imprisonment, when Huerta planned to execute him. However, he describes how he is saved and a clerk at the prison helps him to escape. Five days after his escape from prison Villa flees to the US. The reporter reminds Villa of his success and the fact that he has been recognized as a great man and an important figure in the Revolution. Villa informs them about his glorious battles which he and his North Division endured and of the battle at Zacatecas where they avenged Madero. Later, they are convened to settle a dispute over some land which ends up in Villa having an argument with Melitón which sparks off his desire to organize Villa's assassination.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?312131</url></doc>
