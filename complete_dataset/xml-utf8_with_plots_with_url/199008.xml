<plot>In May 2008, accompanied by his girlfriend Lucy and dog Tippy, Matt Hulse set off on a 100 mile walk, the South Downs Way, which runs from Winchester to Eastbourne. The walk was triggered by the death of his Grandpa Eric, who died in April 2008 at the age of 96. Eric had lived in and cherished the Downs for many years. The trip was planned as a feet first tribute, a commemorative pilgrimage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199008</url></doc>
