<plot>Well-known Danish actor Nicolas Bro reigns supreme in the role of Nicolas Bro. Bro's marriage is on the rocks, his wife Lene has grown tired of their relationship, but instead of grabbing the bull by the horns, Bro decides to save his marriage by filming a love story with him and Lene playing the lead roles - as themselves. Bro's good director friend Christoffer Boe lends him a camera and suggests that he films everything - a piece of advice that Bro takes far too literally. Bro's constant filming succeeds in driving both his friends and wife nuts, and Lene ends up moving to a secret address in Berlin. Bro's plans thus die a sudden death, but obsessed by the idea of completing his film, Bro hires Danish actress Trine Dyrholm to play his wife, Lene. Alas, nothing goes according to plan and Bro's last hope of reclaiming his lost love is to seek out Lene in Berlin. It is a journey that gradually causes Bro to come apart at the seams in his increasingly desperate attempt to register his life on film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407898</url></doc>
