<plot>A documentary, covering the period from 1916 until the short's release in May of 1954, dealing with the many---and mostly unsuccessful---methods of treating polopmyelitis. Cleaniness (in itself), respirators and physical therapy all had little effect, but some success, in curing the paralysis left by the disease, came in the use of the centrifuge hot pack and the rolling bed. Gamma globulin was used in 1951, but it was good for only five weeks. At the end of the short, no cure had been found but there was an optimistic note that the work being done at the University of Pittsburgh by Dr. Jonas Salk, working on a vaccine that would contain all three types of polio virus and presently being tested on a national scale, might prove useful. The Salk Vaccine did that and much more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530475</url></doc>
