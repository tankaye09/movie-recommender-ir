<plot>It's Valentines Day, sweets are currency, and New Yorkers can't seem to get enough of their favorite Moses Donuts. Unfortunately, Stan Moses, the donut creator extraordinaire, is having a crisis of his own. As his agent pushes him to be bigger, and Valerie, the bakery owner, adds a surprise of her own, Stan begins to strain under the pressures of mass production while simultaneously trying to create hand painted masterpieces... one donut at a time. In his manic search for answers to life and love we discover that the solution to his problems may be closer than he realizes. Max, a self-declared sugarholic, might be just what Stan needs, and he, the answer to her addictions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655520</url></doc>
