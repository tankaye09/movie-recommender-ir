<plot>Ma Lei which sounds like "Mary" is a Chinese citizen, living in Hong Kong as the kept woman of a jeweler. She wishes for two things: to get her Hong Kong Identity Card, which will enable her to get work as a legal immigrant; and to marry her boyfriend. However, obtaining an Identity Card is not easy, and getting her boyfriend to introduce her to his family is even more difficult. Mary soon befriends her neighbour, Ken. Their relationship builds. When Mary breaks up with her boyfriend, she moves out, disappearing from Ken's life. She is convinced that they are fated never to meet again when they run into each other literally.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365841</url></doc>
