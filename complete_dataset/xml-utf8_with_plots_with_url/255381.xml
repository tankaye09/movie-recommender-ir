<plot>It's not a party. It's not a pastime. Pool is now a sport. The International Pool Tour presents the North American Open 8-Ball Championship from Las Vegas. The world's greatest players versus the sport's legendary Hall of Famers versus the game's most lethal hustlers. They've all come to play in the most grueling and pressurized 8-Ball challenge ever. For the biggest payday in the history of pool: over 2 million dollars in prize money. They've come for the cash. They've come for the glory. They've come to the International Pool Tour. Real pool, real rules, real money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255381</url></doc>
