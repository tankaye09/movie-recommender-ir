<plot>This documentary provides personal insight and understanding into the difficult situation faced by many Jews in Argentina. Following the bombing of the Israeli embassy and the AMIA Jewish Community Center, both in Buenos Aires, in the 1990s, the economic and political situation for Jews has worsened. In a country with a history of its own particular history of anti-semitism, many Argentinean Jews struggle to maintain their Jewish heritage while demanding justice from a government they identify as corrupt and linked to international terrorism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079946</url></doc>
