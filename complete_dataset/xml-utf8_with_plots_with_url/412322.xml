<plot>A remake of Columbia's 1932 "Texas Cyclone", starring Tim McCoy, in which Larry Clarke (Charles Starrett) rides into the town of Mesa, Arizona, from Texas, where he has just sold his ranch. Several people call him "Ted Crockett",who supposedly has been dead for five years, and a bartender advises him to say he is Crockett, as he can aid the law0abiding citizens that way. Both Red Grindy (Alan Bridge), leader of the town's badmen, and Sheriff Ben Adams (Jack Clifford)are fooled by Larry's resemblence to Crockett, as is Crockett's young widow, Mary (Barbara Weeks), until Larry convinces her his isn't. He finds that all of the Crockett cowhands, with the exception of Neal King (Hal Taliaferro, long past using Wally Wales as a screen or working name), are systematically rustling Mary's cattle. Larry takes charge, sends to Texas for his riders and then brings to an end the reign of terror Grindy and his men have over the territory. Creased in the head by a gunshot, Larry is freed of his amnesia and turns out to actually be Ted Crockett.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412322</url></doc>
