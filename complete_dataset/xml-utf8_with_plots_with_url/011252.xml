<plot>São Paulo's War is a documentary with some fictional segments on the 1932 Revolution. Made with Betacam and Super8 cameras, using extensive material of the period and never-before-seen footage captured on film during the war, the documentary directed by Laís Bodanzky and Luiz Bolognesi was broadcasted by TV Cultura during its prime-time. In 1932, more than two hundred thousand men armed with machine guns, grenades and canons took part in on of the most violent wars in America in the 20th century. Brazilian against Brazilian, in a conflict that involved air raid of big cities - such as Campinas, Santos and São Paulo - and resulted in more than 2.000 dead. Why did this war happen? Who took part in it? What were the details of the conflict? How did the war end? The documentary tells this episode of the history of the country, not only grand but also unknown, with an accessible language and an involving rhythm.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011252</url></doc>
