<plot>Jake, a teenage tearaway, pays a visit to his dying grandmother, Eva, in the retirement home she lives in on his seventeenth birthday. Eva is the only person in the world the rebellious Jake cares enough about to listen too. Jake and Eva share an illicit cigarette as they make plans to play, have fun and run away together, somewhere, anywhere but here. But the moment passes and Jake has to be on his way, but not before Eva gives him some wise advise about life, love and the importance of forgiving his estranged mother for mistakes she's made in her life. As Jake leaves, still contemplating Eva's profound words, he bumps into his mother who tells him Eva passed away the day before.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544170</url></doc>
