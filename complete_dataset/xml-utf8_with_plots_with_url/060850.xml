<plot>One of the finest and most interesting films ever produced. The scene is one of the most noted training stables in the East. The horses are enjoying their "morning bath." A huge tank or bath, especially adapted for the purpose, is provuded into which the horses are driven for their swim. All unconscious of the camera, they are shown true to nature, and one of the most animated and enjoyable pictures ever thrown on a canvas is presented to the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060850</url></doc>
