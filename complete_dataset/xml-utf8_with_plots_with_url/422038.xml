<plot>This scene shows the lower of the several falls in the Spokane River. Racing, tumbling waters, the sound of their own dashings are drowned by the many mills and factories that cover the island and dot the banks (which can be plainly seen in the picture.) Their power is obtained from the rushing waters shown in this scene. A very good and interesting subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422038</url></doc>
