<plot>"One of the best known and one of the most sensational moving pictures ever made. Our camera was stationed at the side of an English run-way filled with obstructions, which is used for cavalry exercises, at Aldershot. Picture to be taken was a number of hussars jumping one of the stiffest of the obstructions. The horses come over in fine form, one after another, until almost at the end of the picture when one of the horses slips throwing the cavalryman over his head and falling heavily on top of him. The other horsemen immediately following barely escape falling on the prostrate horse and man. The latter was severely injured. At the end of the picture several soldiers are seen running up, picking him up and carrying him away. This incident was, of course, entirely unexpected, but the unerring camera recorded every feature of it. The photographic quality of this film is very fine."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017071</url></doc>
