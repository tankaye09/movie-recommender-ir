<plot>This is a novel picture. The workmen tear away the foundation and allow the wall of the palace to fall, but by some mysterious power it rises again of its own accord and presents itself to view precisely as it was before. This is exceedingly good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556679</url></doc>
