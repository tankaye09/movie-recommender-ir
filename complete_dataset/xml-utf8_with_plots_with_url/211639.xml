<plot>A look at ice cream, exploring its origins in Italy, its journey from towns like Zoldo to the rest of Europe, its shift from being a treat for kids to a staple for all (thanks in part to advertising), and the origins and success of HÃ¤agen-Dazs and Ben and Jerry's. Robin Weir, an English chemist turned ice cream historian, provides comment (on the first sorbet in 1650, the first cones - not invented at a World's Fair, and the health problems of 19th century sales), and there's enthusiasm from long-time gelato maker Corrado Brustolon and from the Minghella family, immigrants who took gelato to the Isle of Wight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?211639</url></doc>
