<plot>It began as a border dispute, but soon escalated into a 16-month conflict that transformed a continent. This critically acclaimed documentary series explores the events surrounding the conflict between two neighboring nations struggling for land, power and identity. In the war, Mexico lost almost half of its national territory -- the present Southwest from Texas to California -- to the United States. Although the war lasted only two years, its outcome not only transformed the boundaries of these neighboring countries, but it also shifted the balance of world powers and shaped the destinies of each nation. The four segments are:[1] Neighbors and strangers;[2] War for the borderlands;[3] The hour of sacrifice;[4] The fate of nations. This program is the first to study both sides of the conflict, presenting a historical panorama filled with unforgettable characters such as Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, General Zachary Taylor, and Winfield Scott.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597732</url></doc>
