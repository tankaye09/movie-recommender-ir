<plot>The story is about a diary of a resistance fighter, a writer who died without daring to write truth as he knew it. The legendary diary is passed to a writer's friend by his widow. It is to be made into a novel, put toggether by a neutral colleague who would compile notes into a kind of documentary fiction. After he gets his hands on the script the colleague realizes that it may be a chance of his lifetime, since his writing had no significance so far. He also receives strange phone calls from a jealous third party. The writer is mostly disturbed by the contents of the diary focusing on the event at the end of war which he also witnessed. Now he is facing the dilemna whether to reveal the truth or rather write a "moral story".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106810</url></doc>
