<plot>Columns of three different symbols such as very differently-colored jewels appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen columns. Whilst a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it. If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111288</url></doc>
