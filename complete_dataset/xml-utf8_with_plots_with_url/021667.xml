<plot>The young Benny gets to know the woman of his dreams in an online-game! For the 15 years old Benny it's hard to live in his milieu, as hardier he is as Gin in an online-game. And as this attractive bloke he gets to know the woman of his dreams. Benny bars his own way, in the way he is. In the reality. That's why he gets a new identity. In an online-football-game he becomes Gin. A big, brave, handsome man, who copes with everything. In the virtual world, he gets to know Chayenne, the girl of his dreams. They've got fun. They laugh, they play, they flirt and they arrange to meet in the real world. "In the old stadium, at nine o'clock" Chayenne whispers to him. If this is going to work?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021667</url></doc>
