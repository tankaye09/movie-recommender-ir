<plot>Choori Foroosh (The Bracelet Seller) takes place in Kabul. It is about a beautiful young street-vendor, Rana, whose picture is taken by a journalist. The photograph later appears in a Kabul magazine. This is the beginning of the end for Rana who is then ostracised by her colleagues, repudiated by her husband, sent back to her village and generally rejected by the whole community. The journalist tries to find the girl again but in vain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104586</url></doc>
