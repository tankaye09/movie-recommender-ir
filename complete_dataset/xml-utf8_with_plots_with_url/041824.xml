<plot>Annotate is a journey through the stages of energy generation, transmission and consumption, emulating the most important factor in electricity production - that energy can't be created, it can only be transformed from one form to another. The film offers a closer look at the world of electricity, bringing annotated diagrams to life, and highlighting the complex way in which we relate to, and learn from our environment. The processes which go unnoticed in our busy, energy dependent lives are revealed: and our relationship to the technology around us is seen in a fresh light.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041824</url></doc>
