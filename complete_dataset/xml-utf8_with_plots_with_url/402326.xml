<plot>Faye, Jade, Yen, and Lotus are four women in their thirties who live in Taipei, where the new and old Chinese cultures clash. They are well-educated and have successful careers. But each feels like a failure, because none of them has a good marriage or a happy family life. To fend off their loneliness, they often go to the hot springs together. In the steamy soothing water, they comfort each other in their pain and sorrow. By supporting and loving each other, they find that their friendships become the most stable aspect in their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402326</url></doc>
