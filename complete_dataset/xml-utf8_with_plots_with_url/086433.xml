<plot>The most glamorous rally in this world takes on the east coast of North America as it rolls from Montreal, Quebec down to Key West, Florida. With stops along the way in Boston, Savannah, Miami, Orlando and more, and some of Bullrun's best loved characters, this is the best adventure yet. And not only is there the traditional Bullrun fun and mayhem, there's also a world record attempt as Richard Rawlings and Dennis Collins attempt to beat the driving record from New York to LA in under 32 hours.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086433</url></doc>
