<plot>A lower-middle class family in Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka is going through hard times. Their father has gone blind and can no longer work, and most of the family's money has been wasted on their unemployed son Hiru, who refuses to work. All the family's problems fall on the shoulder of their beautiful daughter Tithi, who works as a prostitute to help the family. The film is a fairly non-judgmental look at the lives of Tithi, her family and the people she comes in contact with through her job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?397542</url></doc>
