A few months after that tragedy, Sol is unable to cover his tuition payment, and is forced to drop out of university. Life becomes hard for Sol Campbell in London. He moves to the small town of Kelh, Germany -- the closest city to Strasbourg, France. There, he works as a librarian in the local community library. Sol Campbell spends much of his time reading books, particularly those about crime, murders and atrocities. As his passion for his reading develops, Sol longs to become the hero of such stories. Therefore, every night Sol Campbell crosses the bridge and enters the city of Strasbourg where he reproduces the fictional crimes as a reality.
