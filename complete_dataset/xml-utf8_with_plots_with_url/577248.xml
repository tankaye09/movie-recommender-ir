<plot>Struggling to make it in Hollywood, Sketch Comedy Group, The Monkey Box, works to come up with an original sketch comedy video to be released on the Internet. Each member of the group possesses a set of skills needed to make the video happen, but each has personality flaws that make it a miracle that the group gets anything done at all. When they start to work on the video, 'Mary Magdalene - Personal Injury Lawyer', things fall apart quickly. The City of Santa Monica wont let them film in their courthouse, Caroline wont budge on the script, and of course, no one really knows who the hell Mary Magdalene is - except for Bob, who remembers she was photo-shopped out of Da Vinci's The Final Dinner. Eventually the director of the group, Mickevich, pulls the plug on the Mary Magdaline sketch, forcing the group to come up with a brand new video idea with only two days before the shoot. Not wanting to waste the biblical costumes and against Caroline's protests, 'Jesus get's to do everything', Mickevich writes a new bit with a biblical character that's a little more well known.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577248</url></doc>
