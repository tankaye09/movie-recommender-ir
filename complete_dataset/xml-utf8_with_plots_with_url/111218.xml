<plot>This "Sports Reel" short from Columbia (production number 8807) features two of the leading professional tennis players of the time, Bobby Riggs, who many years later became better known for the match he lost in "The Battle of the Sexes" than the many he won in his prime, and Don Budge. They offer lessons in the basics of the game, and then play against each other in an exhibition match.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111218</url></doc>
