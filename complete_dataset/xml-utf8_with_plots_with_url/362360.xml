<plot>Ram and Sita Singh have been married for several years and have two children, a son and daughter, named Bhola and Munni respectively. With the exception of tiny Munni, the entire family has to work as construction laborers in order to survive. They would like Bhola and Munni to go to school, study, and lead better lives, but the school principal demands a donation of Rs.500/- which they cannot afford. Nevertheless they decide to raise the money and thus educate their children. Alas, that is not be so, and they die trying, leaving the two children alone, to fend for themselves. A propaganda film to promote former Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi's 20-point and her son's, Sanjay Gandhi's five-point pro grammes during the Emergency clamped by her during the mid-70s.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362360</url></doc>
