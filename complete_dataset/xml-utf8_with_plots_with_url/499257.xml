<plot>Time-fillers were a staple of early-day television, and "Sit or Miss" was a good example of this. Five contestants competed in a televised musical chairs game. The in-studio band played a musical selection, while the contestants paraded around four chairs on the stage. As in the children's game, a scramble for the open chairs ensued whenever the music stopped. The contestant not finding a chair asked a general knowledge question; if they missed, they had to perform a stunt to win a prize. At the end of the show, all five contestants were read clues which described the mystery contents of a box; the contestant who identified it won $75.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499257</url></doc>
