<plot>When Jack and Jill's baby began crying incessantly they thought it was a phase. Eleven months later they were still hoping. Every Saturday Jack takes the baby downtown, away from Jill for a few precious hours. Sitting on a park bench, feeling like the oldest twenty-two year old in the world, Jack can't imagine his life will ever be normal again. If only they had a baby that didn't cry so much. If only they had a baby that wasn't intent on destroying their relationship. If only they had a baby like everyone else's. Fate decides to lend Jack a helping hand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275419</url></doc>
