<plot>Roscoe's wife is fed up with his fondness for practical jokes, and announces she is going home to Mother with no intentions of returning. The next day, a beautiful girl calls at his home and announces she is collecting clothes for the refugees of Patagonia. Roscoe, eager to please and impress, is gathering up all of his wife's clothes for this worthy purpose when his wife returns home. This earns Roscoe a slap upside his head with a baseball bat, and wife departs once more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227595</url></doc>
