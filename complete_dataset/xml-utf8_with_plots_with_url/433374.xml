<plot>In an Alpine community, a pointy-nosed, little man's incessant tuba-playing results in the entire community threatening to evict him. So, the man, accompanied by his dog, goes into the mountains to play the tuba in supposed seclusion. However, the tuba-playing disturbs the sleep of a tree-dwelling Pink Panther, who, unseen by the man, drops a potted plant, bubble gum, cement, and soap and water into the tuba, and the man, undaunted, persists in playing and blames his dog for these attempts to silence the tuba.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433374</url></doc>
