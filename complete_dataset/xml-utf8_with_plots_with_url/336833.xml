<plot>Lily must confront her burdensome past in order to rediscover her identity - and in turn, her strength. At her yearly retreat with her best friend, Caitlin, their innocent but duplicitous relationship veils hidden motives and distorted obligations. The catalyst for change is the arrival of Caitlin's sister and her boyfriend, Trevor. It adds to Lily's turmoil of recovering from a personal tragedy, revealed piecemeal, it encumbers her self-induced punishments, and an attraction to Trevor is the final blow. The collision of intricate relationships exposes the truths the characters can no longer avoid.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336833</url></doc>
