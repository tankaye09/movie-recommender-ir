<plot>This documentary tells about the military history of Canada and its contemporary military situation with particular focus on the international aspect of it. One of key subjects explored is how a small country like Canada has continually gotten itself into far flung theaters of war around the world that seem to be of no real concern for that country beyond the political aspects. To to explain that, military historian Gwynne Dyer illustrates how Canada, either by history or geography, has felt obligated to get involved the dominate international powers' struggles and suggests some possible options for the country to disentangle itself before it gets involved in a foreign war that could destroy it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?552611</url></doc>
