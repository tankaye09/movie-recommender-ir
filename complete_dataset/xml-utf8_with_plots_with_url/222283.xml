<plot>Each episode or volume of this 5-part series follows a celebrity host as he or she experiences the sights, sounds, food, people, and culture found along a famous U.S. highway. In volume 1, musician/actor Levon Helm explores Southern culture and blues music as he drives from Memphis to New Orleans on U.S. Highway 61. Volume 2 follows actor/director Robert Townsend as he searches out the old Mom-and-Pop roadside attractions along Route 66, the "Mother Road", from Chicago to Los Angeles. Volume 3 finds actress Teri Garr between land and sea as she drives the Pacific Coast Highway from Big Sur to Washington state. Actor Graham Greene explores the magnificence, desolation, and mystery of the Western landscape and its people along U.S. Highway 93, the "Killer Road", from Hoover Dam to Glacier National Park, in volume 4. Finally, in volume 5 actress Maria Conchita Alonso observes the contrasts between past and future, between commercial development and native wilderness, as she drives Florida's coastal highway A1A from Amelia Island to Key West.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222283</url></doc>
