<plot>This title comes from the error filled Silent Short Film Working Papers by Richard E. Braff. There is no record of any such film bearing this title being produced or distributed at this time. Production may have been suspended before completion or the film may have been released under another title. The Selig release for 22 November 1912 (the date given for this film) was Mike's Brainstorm (1912), a different film entirely, with a different cast.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067177</url></doc>
