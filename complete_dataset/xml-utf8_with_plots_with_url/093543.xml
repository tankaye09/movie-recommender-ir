<plot>Shows a man in birch bark canoe paddling for dear life. He suddenly stops paddling and sits down to rest, but the canoe continues to rush on at the same rapid pace, though no current or rapids are shown in the river. The effect is very mysterious, but the explanation is very simple. His previous efforts were to enable him to reach the suction of a large steamer which was purposely left out of the camera. The scene now changes and shows a number of small boats in the background, and the man in the canoe gives an exhibition of his skill in handling his boat in an upset race. He capsizes the canoe, fills it with water, and while swimming, empties and climbs into it in a very short time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093543</url></doc>
