<plot>Jones comes home from a masquerade ball, clad in a Scotch costume and his usual confused condition. He gets into his neighbor's apartments instead of his own. He hears his neighbor and wife coming into their rooms, and being now thoroughly frightened, crawls under the bed to hide. His neighbor discovers him, hauls him out, and, by way of punishment, throws him through the window.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279181</url></doc>
