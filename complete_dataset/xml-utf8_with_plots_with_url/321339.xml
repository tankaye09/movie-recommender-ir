<plot>Miss Roosevelt launches the Kaiser's Yankee yacht. This is one of the most successful launching pictures ever obtained by us, in spite of the fact that the boat was launched in a rain storm. A great deal of animation is added to the scene by the erecting of temporary masts with a string of flags from stern to stern, just as the boat is launched.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321339</url></doc>
