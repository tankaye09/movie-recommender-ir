<plot>Autistic Indraneel Thakur, who works for a living as a waiter in a Café in India, has a body of a grown man and mind of a seven year old. One day while closing the café, a young woman named Maya Trivedi, asks for his assistance as she has missed the last bus. Indraneel assists her, takes her home, finds out that she is pregnant, helps her give birth, agrees to take care of the child, Gungun, and thereafter Maya leaves, never to return. Years later, Gungun has grown up, attends school, and believes that Indraneel is her dad. Then their world is changed upside down when Maya's dad, Dayanath Trivedi, arrives from London, Britain, to take custody of his grandchild, if necessary through the courts. Indraneel refuses to part with Gungun, and as a result a case is filed in Court. The Judge initially hears this case, finds Indraneel incompetent to be a responsible father and tentatively puts Gungun in the Court's custody. Now a date is set when Indraneel must take up the gargantuan task of proving to a less than compassionate Court that he is capable of looking after Gungun, knowing fully well that he, himself, is unable to look after himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352753</url></doc>
