<plot>This is the first of a series covering the primitive sports of the Indians. All are taken from practically the same point of view with the boulder-strewn side of a ravine in the background and may readily be joined into a long film, should it be deemed desirable to use them in that manner. This scene shows a wrestling bout between two lively and muscular young bucks stripped to breech-clouts. They are urged on by a number of other Indians, some of them mounted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391444</url></doc>
