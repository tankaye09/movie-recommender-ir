<plot>They were the daughters of suffragists, the mothers of feminists. One hundred thousand soldiers. One hundred thousand women. This is the story of one of them. In May of 1942, Congress approved a bill establishing the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps or WAAC. Women flocked from all over the country to sign up. For some it was a chance to support their country. For others it was a chance to break down the confines of society and prove their worth. This documentary explores the experience of these warriors through the eyes of Ruth Blanton, a Bald Knob, Arkansas woman who went overseas as a stenographer during a time when most men believed that a woman's patriotic duty was taking care of hearth and home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016239</url></doc>
