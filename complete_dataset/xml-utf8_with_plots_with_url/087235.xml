<plot>A fire has swept through Durland's Riding Academy in Manhattan. The fire has mostly died down, but firefighters are still at the scene, hosing down the smoking remains of the buildings. Many others are there as well, helping to clean up, inspecting the ruins, or just getting a look at everything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087235</url></doc>
