<plot>Mitch (Randall Sims) is an eighth year college senior. He has changed majors several times to avoid going out into the real world. Dwight (Christopher Lapish) is Mitch's roommate, also in his eighth year. Dwight enjoys hanging out and has no real inclination to do anything. Lisa (Noelle Manuel) is a fourth year senior and the object of Mitch's affection. When Lisa gives Mitch a copy of On The Road by Jack Kerouac, Mitch's life takes a definite turn. Mitch decides to become a beatnik, hitchhike to New York, talk with Kerouac and write the Next Great American Novel. Dwight and Lisa both decide to join him on his quest but their journey is flawed from the onset. The trio travels by car, train, bus and on foot learning valuable life lessons along the way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195043</url></doc>
