<plot>It is a biography documentary, the story of Bill Wilson and his family living and working on a vineyard in wine country of Temecula, California. It uncovers their life before becoming wine makers and owners and what they went through to get where they are today. It is about learning who makes the wine, instead of how the wine is made. Knowing what a typical day of a wine-maker goes through in the business but also how it coincides with family relationships. It takes place over a year, through the different seasons of what happens during the year of a wine-maker and how the family is better and stronger because of the life they choose to live.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335862</url></doc>
