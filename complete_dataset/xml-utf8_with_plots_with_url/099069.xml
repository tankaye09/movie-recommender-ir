<plot>Miles Stanford is a writer at the hot entertainment Magazine'Freeze-Frame.' Miles, who was once at the top of his game, has hit a slump,-that is, until he's told to interview this issue's cover girl, Macoy Madison. The two are instantly attracted to each other, but their relationship comes to a crashing halt when Macoy is abducted. Miles is chosen to deliver the ransom to the kidnappers.
