<plot>Out in space, a cosmic villain called Mondraggor tried to gain possession to a Pyramid of Power, an object that would give the possessor ultimate power. The Pyramid, sensing Mondraggor's evil nature, voluntarily shatters itself and its pieces scatter around the planet Earth. Two kids witness this event and travel to China to recover to gain one piece. There, they meet three pandas who agree to help the humans recover the components. Against them, Mondraggor is out to stop them while he following their search for the pieces using his power over the elements from space and his power of humans' minds on Earth. However, the pandas have their own power to merge into one being, Poppapanda, which can repel any attack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421498</url></doc>
