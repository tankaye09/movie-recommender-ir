Their Chief asks Abdul to take charge of Project M, dealing with India's nuclear capability for defense, while Ajay proceeds on a vacation to Switzerland. Once there, he meets with beautiful Anju and both fall in love with each other. When he returns to India, he is told that Abdul has been killed, the file pertaining to Project M is missing, and he is assigned the task of not only recovering the file but also apprehending the culprits. Ajay sets out to Bangalore and finds that Anju also lives there with her wealthy businessman dad, Brij Mohan alias BM.. Ajay will soon find out that his romance with Anju is short-lived as her dad may be connected with the masterminds who had the secret file stolen, and are now determined to do away with Ajay as they had with Abdul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239676</url></doc>
