<plot>Dr. Peter Langham, a brilliant research scientist for the ethically questionable Medicorp Group, is confronted with the greatest dilemma he has ever faced when he finds himself hopelessly in love with one of his own experiments; the relationship appears doomed in its infancy at the hand of the medical authorities. Matters seem further complicated by the unexpected return of Dr. Langham's estranged wife until the perfect solution to his problems is revealed to him in a blinding flash of inspiration. Nonetheless, his love is to remain unrequited within the bizarre love triangle he has inadvertently created.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166729</url></doc>
