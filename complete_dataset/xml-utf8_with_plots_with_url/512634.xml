<plot>Janet is an attractive and together young woman smart enough to be cognizant of a female's frequently precarious position in the corporate hierarchy. Steve is the business owner's brother and an insufferable chauvinist boor. He is a figure immediately recognizable and universally loathed by every woman who has ever entered the hallowed portals of the corporate world. Tricked into lunch alone with Steve, Janet suffers his outrageous and demeaning discourse as long as she can, until she can only retreat into her imagination... A place where she can safely deal with a creature such as this. A place where she can make him sharply aware of the error of his ways.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?512634</url></doc>
