<plot>Two men sit in their local pub during the day when one decides to take a quick walk down to the bookies to place a bet on a horse. When he arrives at the bookies he places his bets with the couple of other punters there. He also bumps into the son of an old friend of his in there as well. However things get complicated when the boy holds up the shop and demands all the money from behind the counter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?190473</url></doc>
