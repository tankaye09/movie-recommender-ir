<plot>Mariam, an 11 year-old Palestinian girl, begs her mother for the extra money she needs to buy a cake at the local bakery. Her mother begrudgingly relents, but when Mariam arrives at the bakery, she realizes that she still doesn't have enough money. Determined to get the cake, she sets out to brave the obstacles and land some cash, but her initial efforts are futile. In an act of desperation, Mariam enlists the help of her younger sister, and together, they come up with a scheme to try to raise enough money to buy the cake in time. In Make A Wish, what begins as a simple trip to the bakery turns into a journey that depicts not only the subtle tensions of a politically charged environment, but also illustrates the grief that can only result from growing up under occupation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353323</url></doc>
