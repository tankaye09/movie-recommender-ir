<plot>The character Billy is played out in two very different ways, this unique film follows Billy through various scenarios good and bad. In one life Billy is seen to be a great footballer and possible football professional, his proud father Maz behind him all the way. This Billy goes on to be a happy family man and lands his dream job at West Ham Utd. On the other hand a very dark image of Billy is seen, the street mugger, vandal and even murderer. As Billy's life transforms so does his father Maz, who becomes unemployed and a heavy drinker...a broken man. Billy and his gang terrorize the local community until a vigilante gang decide they have had enough. At a stand off in an underpass Billy is beaten to death, the victim of his own persona. The film ends with various voice overs from characters portrayed in the film, each of them passing on a powerful message.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070817</url></doc>
