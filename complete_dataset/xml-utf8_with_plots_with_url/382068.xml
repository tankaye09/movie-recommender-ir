<plot>Small town South Africans Sage and Billy are desperate to get away from it all - she to pioneer tropical ice sculpture, he to procrastinate with strange inventions while avoiding writing the great South African novel. They settle on a Mozambican beach near a small village, which is blighted by a strange ancestral curse. Their relationship, too, is afflicted. Into this steamy setting, in which quite literally anything could happen, comes Joao, a gorgeous Brazillian who throws testosterone and capoeira into the mix.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382068</url></doc>
