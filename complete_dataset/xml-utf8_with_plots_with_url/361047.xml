<plot>During the 1980s, the MATINEE AT THE BIJOU series of classic cartoons, selected short subjects, cliffhanging serials and feature films was one of the most popular series on PBS. The American movie-going experiences of the 1930s, 40s and 50s were faithfully recreated week after week for five consecutive seasons. PBS member stations loved the series because it appealed to all age and income groups - and audiences came back week after week for more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361047</url></doc>
