<plot>Jim Barnes, a construction superintendent in the rural mid-South, is quickly climbing the ladders of stature and wealth, achieving his very own 'American dream,' and he's a mere 21 years old. On the brink of his prime, he makes one split-second decision to bend the rules for a homeless Mexican teenager. What was meant to be an act of compassion spirals into a liability lawsuit, and now Jim can either fess up to his mistake and lose everything he's worked for, or allow an elderly man to take the blame. Jim's journey through this discomforting plight ultimately gives him a fresh awareness of what really makes a true man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277026</url></doc>
