<plot>Filmmaker Victoria Clay-Mendoza's father, an executive with Pepsi-Cola, moved his family to Mexico at age 38 so he could pursue his dreams of becoming a bullfighter. She never understood his fascination with the sport, and he died before she got a chance to ask him. Not long after his death, however, she traveled to Spain to try to understand her father's passion for and devotion to the art of bullfighting, and in the process met up with several young Spaniards who were pursuing the same dream her father had.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354327</url></doc>
