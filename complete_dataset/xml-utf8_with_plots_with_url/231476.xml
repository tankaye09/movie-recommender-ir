<plot>This is the story of the Shivalkar family. Stigmatized as a family of criminals, thugs, and gangleaders, each generation is subjected to the same oppression and the vicious circles created partly by themselves, and by the surrounding communities, including the police, politicians, and people in general. These are the circumstances under which Rohit Shivalkar (Sanjay Dutt) grows up under. Nicknamed "Boxer Bhai" by his friends as he excelled in boxing in his college days, Rohit grows up to be perhaps the most powerful of the Shivlkars. His reach is beyong the state's chief ministers, the police commissioners, and an election cannot take place before a deal is made with Boxer Bhai. Rohit has weaknesses, he cannot stand any woman being called a prostitute, because his mom, Sonu (Namrata Shirodkar) was one; and he has fallen hard for a married woman, Gauri (Shilpa Shetty), who is enduring a marriage with a phsycially abusive spouse. Rohit snatches her out of this abusive relationshisp and re-marries her. But Rohit's problems are far from over. There is a change in the political scenario and Rohit does not find any support from any god-father. He is ordered to be arrested - dead or alive. Will his luck help him overcome obstacles? Will his new wife support him?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231476</url></doc>
