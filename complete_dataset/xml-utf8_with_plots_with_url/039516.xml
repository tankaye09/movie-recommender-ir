<plot>To some of the greatest performing magicians alive today, Jerry Andrus is the name of a legend. Renowned as one of the best and most influential "close-up magic" performers of our time, Jerry is equally regarded among scientists, educators and skeptics as a visionary, poet, philosopher, inventor and creator of truly astounding optical illusions. Andrus; The Man, the Mind &amp; the Magic is the story of a modern day Da Vinci told by the man himself, along with extensive interviews from some of the notable thinkers, artists and magicians in the world today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039516</url></doc>
