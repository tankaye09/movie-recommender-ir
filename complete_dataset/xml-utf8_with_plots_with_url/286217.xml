<plot>Virendra is a gangster with a good heart. And he always has time and empathy for needy and poor people. His family are aware of his criminal career, and will have nothing to do with him, and he is not welcome home anymore. Virendra saves the life of a beautiful young woman named Kavita, who falls in love with him. But Virendra is not ready to fall in love, as his life is risky and he faces the risk of death - at the hands of his rivals, and other gangsters who he has wronged - every moment of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?286217</url></doc>
