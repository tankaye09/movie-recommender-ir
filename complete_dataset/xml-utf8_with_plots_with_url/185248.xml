<plot>Exercise with Ching Yung is a personal, experimental documentary film that presents the filmmaker's retired father who likes to exhibit his own creation of Tai Chi in public and sings Karaoke with his friends. This film explores the internal struggle of being the daughter of an old-fashioned Chinese father, whose lifelong wish has been to have a son to carry on his family name. The film examines the father-daughter relationship and investigates the daughter's struggle with whether and how to fulfill her father's expectations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185248</url></doc>
