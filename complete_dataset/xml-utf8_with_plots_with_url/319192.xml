<plot>A lazy owner of a gymnasium, Abhijeet Samarth lives a wealthy lifestyle in Pune along with his advocate wife, Asavari, and a collegian daughter, Rasika, who is going steady with a wealthy Corporator's son, Vikram Malgude. Abhijeet is friendly with Advocate Anantrao Mahasabdey, who also lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his wife, Ulka; a collegian son, Asim; a school-going daughter' Chinni; and his widowed mother. Both friends and Asavari get together every Saturday to enjoy some alcoholic drinks and share poetry. Their harmonious lifestyle changes, albeit hilariously, when Abhijit comes across a love-letter addressed to his wife and starts to suspect that she is having an affair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319192</url></doc>
