<plot>Lauranne (50), lives with Patrick (50), a perverted director with little talent. Even though she's bright, her education pushed her to act as a victim in all her intimate relationships with men, until Christian (30) becomes an important part of her life. Patrick had an idea for a script and asked Lauranne to write it for him but "accidentally" forgot to mention her name when it became an award winning success. More, Patrick shamelessly asks Lauranne to write a new project. She accepts although she broke her left wrist. Lauranne finds Patrick with his niece, both naked in bed. Lauranne decides to dump him but she is forced to stay in their house. The cohabitation is a nightmare: Patrick becomes more perverted and violent when he realizes that he won't be able to use Lauranne again both on a professional and a sexual level. Christian has to deal with his friends who are extremely odious to Lauranne. But the toughest opposition comes from his mother, Odile (70) who plays mind game with Christian. He has a very hard time choosing between the two women he loves the most. He takes the easy way out by subconsciously reactivating an old brain tumor. Odile won the battle. Lauranne doesn't get a chance to see Christian before he dies. There, something out of the ordinary will help her understand that she can resume her life being happy and not acting as a victim anymore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104771</url></doc>
