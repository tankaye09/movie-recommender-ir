<plot>"The Messenger" is a mysterious woman who appears to a mobster hiding underground to tell him about his ultimate fate. A bag with a "Kendama" ball and string toy gets mixed up with a bag of onions, and leads a couple to ponder their relationship. Fujio awakes from "Cold Sleep" to find he has crashed on an unfamiliar planet with some crazy people and an attractive "new Eve." Mayuko, has an itch she keeps secret before she is introduced to a mysterious yet strangely satisfying cure (Pandora - Hong Kong Leg). A man finds himself surrounded by the police and holds some women hostage as they eat "Hijiki" (edible seaweed) and advise him about what to do. In a class studying the Potsdam Declaration, some high school students find their minds elsewhere. Tojo is keeping a tally of the "snapping" of the tight shorts worn by the girls jumping hurdles outside the window according to color. Will he find ultimate "Justice." Ever since she can remember, "Arita" has appeared somewhere on every drawing or other piece of paper she touches, starting with the first crude drawings of her childhood. But what is it, and is it alive ?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273195</url></doc>
