<plot>Prisoner of a marriage devoid of passion, Robert has decided to find himself a mistress via the Internet. Tormented by the perspective of cheating on his wife, he sees his guilt manifest itself in the form of various hallucinations. On top of being relentlessly spied upon by a mother-in-law as unfriendly as she is intrusive, Robert has more and more difficulty distinguishing between his imagination and reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375084</url></doc>
