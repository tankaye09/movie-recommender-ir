<plot>Dr Julian Stone had a happy life until he decided to propose. The unorthodox psychologist is forced to choose between his over dependent patients and his fiancee. His enmeshed patients can't break free of him until they have been cured of their obsessive compulsive disorders and delusions. As his wedding draws near he has less and less time to cure them individually. Before long it becomes too much and Julian is left with one alternative. The doctor puts his patients into a confrontational form of group therapy. Is this really meant to cure them or is Julian getting them to kill each other off? Prompted by a mysterious Mafioso figure, the patients decide to take pre-emptive action and kill the doctor before their own doom takes hold, only to find they have been cured in the process! Or have they?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061101</url></doc>
