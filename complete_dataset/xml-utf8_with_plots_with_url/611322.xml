<plot>An ex-con, Trevor "Cyclops" Tucker is revengeful and feels betrayed over a foiled heist that sent him to prison for 10 years. After his release, he reunites with an old partner, Bones. And along with a young bootlegger named Dino, they plan rob Domino, the alleged traitor's poolhall. Soon enough, Domino finds out their scheme with the help of a detective named Cuffs and two talented poolplayers, Jazz and Jinx. They devise an excellent plan to take the lowlifes down once the bait's taken.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611322</url></doc>
