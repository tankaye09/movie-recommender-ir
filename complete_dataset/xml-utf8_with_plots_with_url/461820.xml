<plot>When Reuben comes to town there is always "something doing" and the fact is borne out in this case also. Our rustic friend has received one of those persuasive circulars from a "city gent" advising him that he can buy real gold for a song. Reuben bites on the alluring bait and arrives in New York, carpet bag and all. The sharp displays his wares to the unsophisticated yokel, and shows him the certificate from the assayer proving apparently that the gold is genuine. The jay pays over his hard earned dollar and the sharper vanishes. An everyday occurence in the great metropolis. Fine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461820</url></doc>
