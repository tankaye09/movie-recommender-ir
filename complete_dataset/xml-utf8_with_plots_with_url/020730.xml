<plot>Neha lives a wealthy lifestyle along with her mom, Suman, dad, and sister, Aarti. She meets with, falls in love, and gets married to Dr. Aman Mehra, who practices in Life Care Hospital, while Aarti, an Intern at the same hospital, is in love with Police Inspector Siddharth, and both hope to get married soon. After celebrating their first wedding anniversary, Aman is approached by a gun-toting couple on the beach, both threaten him, and ask him to sign a Death Certificate for a male named Avinash Malhotra, pronouncing his death due to natural causes. They also pay him an advance and tell him that the balance will be paid after he prepares the certificate. Aman is reluctant to prepare this document, but when Neha's life is threatened, he does so - little realizing that in so doing, the vengeful spirit of the dead male will manifest itself in Neha's body - changing their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020730</url></doc>
