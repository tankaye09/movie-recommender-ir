<plot>Norte y Sur is an experimental documentary that explores the "migrant experience". My parents, Victoria and Enrique spend nine months out of the year as temporary workers in Madison, Wis., before returning to Mexico City. In 2006, we traveled by land from Madison to Mexico City documenting the experience. This film focuses on the exploration of the landscape, emphasizing the porosity of liminal spaces such as the border between Mexico and the US, the land in between, experiencing time through the lens of the traveler, repetition, anxieties converge with meditations and remembrances, as soft traces of "pinched" time, time bended and ruptured in a narrative that reveals the politics of perceived "absence", don't ask don't tell, but mainly don't ever ask for anything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400488</url></doc>
