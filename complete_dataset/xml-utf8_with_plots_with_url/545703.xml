<plot>May 25, 2005, the last day of school in Beslan, Russia, celebrated with the Ceremony of the Last Bell, when a graduating senior carries a new student around the assembly who rings a bell for the last time. The school year started on September 1st, 2004 and was to be no different than any other. Tragically, within 48 hours, everything changed. Chechen rebels had crafted an intricate plot to take hostages at the school. A bomb was detonated by accident and 344 hostages were killed, 172 were children. But THE BOYS OF BESLAN is not so much about the slaughter of innocents, but rather the spirit and resiliency of youth, embodied in the shining faces of young survivors Kazik and Asik Aliev, twin brothers. For even as they speak so sadly of the horror they witnessed that dark day in September, there is still the twinkle of hope in their eyes. These brave boys are not dwelling in the past but look firmly toward the future, one that will include, they hope ... peace on earth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545703</url></doc>
