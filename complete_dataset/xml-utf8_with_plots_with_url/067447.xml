<plot>Memory loss. Nerve pain. Joint degeneration. Chronic fatigue. Sexual dysfunction. An unknown proportion of breast cancer survivors may be 'cured' of the disease, only to be left with a host of long-term, disabling symptoms. "Beyond Breast Cancer: Stories of Survivors" explores the experiences of nine courageous, everyday women who survive breast cancer only to discover that their health struggles continue after their cancer treatment ends. Increasingly, as more women are surviving cancer and are determined to live normally after treatment, there is a popular notion that not only can you survive breast cancer, but you can also be better than before. For women with post-treatment conditions, that standard sharply conflicts with their reality. From diagnosis, through treatment, to current medical problems, the film chronicles their transition from patient to survivor and discusses what it means to have to seek out a "new normal." With humor, raw honesty, and dignity, the women candidly tell of their experiences and engage the viewer in their intense emotional and physical journeys. Part of a larger, interdisciplinary UCLA study funded by the Susan G. Komen Foundation for which nearly a hundred women were interviewed, this film captures the essence of all their stories-the difficulties, the triumphs, and the wisdom that ensues from enduring a chronic health challenge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067447</url></doc>
