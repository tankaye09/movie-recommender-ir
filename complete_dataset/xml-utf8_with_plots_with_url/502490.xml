<plot>Smile Boston Project is a short documentary film about artist Bren Bataclan's "Smile Boston Project" street art project. In the summer of 2003, Bataclan began leaving paintings of his colorful characters for people to take all over the Boston area on park benches, in subway stations, schoolyards, and other public locations. To each painting Bataclan attached a note that read, "This painting is yours to keep if you promise to smile at random people more often." The film covers the project from its inception in the summer of 2003 through the spring of 2007, examining Bataclan's influences, his goals, and the reactions of the people who have found, purchased, and critiqued his paintings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502490</url></doc>
