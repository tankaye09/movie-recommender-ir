<plot>"Living with Fragile X" features the real-life stories of several children and adults who have fragile X syndrome - their challenges and triumphs, their parents' hopes and fears - it's all here. The film reveals researchers' work toward a cure for fragile X, and experts in the field share their knowledge and insights into the disorder. In "Living with Fragile X", you will meet several unforgettable individuals. Garrett is 5 years old and still doesn't speak. His parents hope he will develop speech soon, but the years continue to pass with little change. Meanwhile his younger brother Wyatt surpasses him in learning. Wyatt shares his own insights about his brother. Conor and Ryan are identical twins in their 20s. They will never drive a car, live independently, or go on a date, much less marry and have children of their own. Their parents are concerned about what may happen to their sons when they are no longer here to care for them. These and other stories are told in this compelling, emotionally-charged film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339345</url></doc>
