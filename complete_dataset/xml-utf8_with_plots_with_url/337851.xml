<plot>Following the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri and giving in to international pressure, Syria withdraws its military forces from Lebanon in the end of April 2005 after 30 years of occupation. This documentary gathers the testimonies of Lebanese expatriates living in Paris. Feelings of relief, independence and Christian/Muslim unity overtake the Lebanese community. It is a moment to reflect on the possibility of returning home after so many years of adjusting to the Parisian way of life but also a moment of uncertainty: a series of explosions have rocked the country since the beginning of the demonstrations. Gebran Tueni, a respected politician and journalist, has come to Paris to give a passionate speech. These are some of the last images of one of the founding fathers of the movement who was assassinated just a few months later in a car explosion, on the 12th of December 2005.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337851</url></doc>
