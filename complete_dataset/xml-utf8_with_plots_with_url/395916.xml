<plot>Al a young and naive working class family man, unemployed and faced with an eviction, makes a rash decision. He seeks out the help of an old high school buddy named Step who reluctantly agrees to help Al by teaching him the trade secrets of street hustling to get the cash he needs. Little does Al know that Step's true intention is to hustle him by pimping him out. Overcome by hopelessness, Al accepts his fate; it's too late for him. He's entered the belly of the beast; a world he never knew existed. In a series of peculiar episodes laced with dark humor, both men create an unexpected bond. Truly an odd couple of an urban lower end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?395916</url></doc>
