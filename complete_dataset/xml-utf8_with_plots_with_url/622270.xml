<plot>"Twitch" is a coming of age story about a teenage girl forced to care for her disabled mother, while beginning to come to terms with her emerging sexuality. Irrationally fearful that her mother's disability is contagious, she attempts to suffocate any possibility of illness. Her boyfriend, oblivious to her increasing hypochondria, only seems interested in her physically. Unable to find the emotional intimacy she craves, she ultimately must confront her fears and learn to take care of herself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622270</url></doc>
