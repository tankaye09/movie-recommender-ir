<plot>The second in a series of such shows on Animal Planet, Animal Cops: Detroit follows the animal cruelty investigations teams of the Michigan Humane Society. Their purpose it to investigate reports of animal cruelty in Detroit and in surrounding communities. While doing this, they sometimes seize animals that are in urgant need of medical care or show signs of abuse. Unlike the ASPCA in New York, these investigators do not have arrest powers, however, they do have the authority to request search and/or arrest warrants be issues and then turn the warrants over to either the Detroit Police Department or the Wayne County Sheriff's Office to be served. The agents also work closely with the Detroit Police and Detroit Animal Control on a task force designed to rid Detroit of dog fighting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040751</url></doc>
