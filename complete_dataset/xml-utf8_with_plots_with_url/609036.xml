<plot>Anthony "Tony" Aniscol was singlehandedly raised by his Nanay Eden. Because of his superior intelligence, Tony got his PhD at a young age and was taken in by scientist Dr. Morgan Peralta as a laboratory assistant. While Tony becomes friends with Dr. Morgan's daughter Michelle, he is despised by the doctor's son Joaquin. After a laboratory accident kills Dr. Morgan, Tony finds himself shrunk to a mere six inches. While he struggles to get back to normal, Tony must face enemies like the Indian Warrior Red Cloud and the greedy Joaquin. Can Tony get himself out of trouble? Will he ever get back to his Nanay Eden and Michelle? How is the rich philanthropist-politician Gil Gante connected to his predicament?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?609036</url></doc>
