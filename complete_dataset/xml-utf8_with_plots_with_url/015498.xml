<plot>After noting a long stretch of track that has just been cleared, we see the giant rotary with all steam on, approaching on a parallel track, and throwing a continuous stream of snow into the air. While the rotary is drawing nearer, two lively fellows engage in a snowballing and then a wrestling match. By this time, the huge fan of the rotary may be seen swiftly revolving and eating its way through the great bank of snow in front of it. Formerly a snowfall like the one shown in this scene would have delayed transcontinental traffic for a week, but in this instance, there was no delay whatever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015498</url></doc>
