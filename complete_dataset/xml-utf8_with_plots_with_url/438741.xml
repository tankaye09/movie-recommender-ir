<plot>In the summer of 1964, Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys started their ascent to superstardom after being signed to Liberty records. In 1965, the band released the single, "This Diamond Ring" which climbed to the top of the pop charts and garnered the band their first #1 hit. Their second single, "Count Me In" went to #2, proving that their success was no fluke. The success of the band continued with 10 more Top 40 hits between 1965-1968 including another #1 single, "Save Your Heart for Me." In 1965, Gary himself was named Cash Box magazine's "Male Vocalist of the Year", beating other contenders, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. As part of the Pop Legends Live concert series, Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys take to the stage to perform their greatest hits and other favorites. As an added feature, Pop Legends Live also takes you backstage for a rare behind-the-scenes interview with Gary Lewis. Includes "This Diamond Ring", "Save Your Heart for Me", "Sealed with a Kiss", "She's Just My Style" and 7 more!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?438741</url></doc>
