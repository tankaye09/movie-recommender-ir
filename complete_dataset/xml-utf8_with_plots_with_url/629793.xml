<plot>Teenaged Jeff stupidly thinks that the road to popularity is a fast car and nice clothes. However, his girlfriend and his dad soon show him the error of his ways by proving--via such examples as The Ten Commandments and the intricacies of hydroelectric dam construction, subjects of vital interest to teenagers in the 1950s--that sound ideals, of course, are the basis of popularity. Jeff learns a valuable lesson that will serve him well later in life: if you want hot chicks, forget the red Corvette and the Armani suits--drive a Studebaker and become a born-again construction engineer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629793</url></doc>
