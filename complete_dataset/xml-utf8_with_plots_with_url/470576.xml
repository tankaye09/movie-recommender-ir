<plot>Saturday morning kids' game show. It involved three-part multiple choice questions. The kids would all run to a particular place on the set, depending on their choice of answers. They could fake each other off. The host would announce, "Last chance!" and they could change their answer, but if they were too slow, they were out. Host Paul Winchell sometimes had ventriloquistic interludes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470576</url></doc>
