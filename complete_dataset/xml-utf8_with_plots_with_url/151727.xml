<plot>Three college students take on the challenge of giving up their computers to see how their academic, social, and work lives are affected. No Facebook. No YouTube. No e-mail. How will they get their work done? Will they cheat? Who will survive the longest? This one-hour documentary follows Carleton College students Andrew, Caitlin, and Chel as they go through "digital detox" and learn to interact with themselves and with others in ways we have largely forgotten.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151727</url></doc>
