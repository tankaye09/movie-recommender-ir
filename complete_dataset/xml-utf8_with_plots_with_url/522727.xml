<plot>While studying genome sequences of basic molecular mechanisms found in cerebral DNA (topoisomerase functionality), Professor Calvin 'Cal' Gordon has inadvertently acquired complete utilization of his neural/cellular network during a self-induced experimental procedure. He can now tap into his genetic memory, granting him experiences, abilities, and thoughts derived from his ancestral roots. Finding himself in a high security mental institution with no knowledge of how he got there, Gordon escapes and begins his odyssey of self-discovery. Eventually, Gordon will obtain disturbing knowledge about his identity, his ties to a scientific secret society, and will develop profound spiritual abilities as he becomes "infected" with the DNA of others. Each time he assimilates a stranger's DNA, he is bombarded with extraordinary surrealistic images, blurring his ability to distinguish between current reality and genetic memory. Gordon's ability to adopt an individual's psychological and physiological identity begins to negatively affect his own genetic markers, diminishing his ability to escape his pursuers and find a way to reverse his transformation. As he masters his new abilities, he discovers that his father was used to create hybrids, some of whom became psychotic and later escaped captivity; these dangerous unfortunates have been at large for decades. Cal must hunt down and extract genetic memory information from those individuals that will help him find and expose the secret society. He offers medical and spiritual help to people he meets along the way, while avoiding capture and dealing with his own dilemma.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522727</url></doc>
