<plot>Popular Norwegian TV-personality Per Ståle Lønning combines his lifelong hobby of fishing with the talk-show-formula. He travels around the world with famous Norwegians as teammates, participating in international fishing competitions. The competition works only as surroundings for a closer and more personal meeting with some of Norway's most controversial public figures. Among his guests are the defense minister Kristin Krohn-Devold, the outspoken whaler Steinar Bastesen, the liberal priest Einar Gelius, and the famous political secretary Arne Treholt who in 1986 was sentenced to life for espionage, but later pardoned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?136722</url></doc>
