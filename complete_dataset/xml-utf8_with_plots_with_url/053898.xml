<plot>"5 Steps to an Automatic Swing" is a fun, instructional video that teaches kids and adults how to hit like a pro! Former major league baseball power hitter Dante Bichette introduces your "Automatic Swing" instructor, professional hitting coach Frank Cacciatore. Along with former professional baseball players Rod Brewer and Brett King, Frank will take you and a group of young ball players, including members of the U.S. Championship Apopka Little League Team, through step by step routines that are not only fun and educational, but will help you become a better, stronger, more consistent and powerful hitter. Included in this video are easy-to-remember and fun-to-do drills, along with baseball and sports trivia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?053898</url></doc>
