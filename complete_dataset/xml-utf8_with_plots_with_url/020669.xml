<plot>Arun meets Seema by accident and both are attracted to each other. But Seema has a questionable background, which do create doubts in the minds of Arun and his mother. Arun is then involved in an accident, and everyone believes he is dead. Seema is devastated, and takes to alcohol, singing and dancing in a bar, and is raped by a man. Then Arun returns, and Seema is overjoyed to see him, but is hesitant to tell him about what had occurred. Arun takes Seema to his home, and introduces them to his family, namely his mom, his sister, Priti, and his brother-in-law, Prem. Seema is stunned and shocked when she sees Prem, for she recognizes him as the man who had raped her. Now Seema must decide to keep this terrible secret to herself and get married to Arun, or simply disappear from his life altogether.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020669</url></doc>
