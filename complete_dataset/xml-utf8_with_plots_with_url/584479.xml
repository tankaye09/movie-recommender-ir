<plot>2000 Year-Old Myth: The Promise Keeper movie springboards from a 2000 Year-Old myth. Nail fetishes were used in certain West African villages when a bargain was struck, or a solemn oath was made. The promise maker would drive a nail into a fetish, which had been crafted by a local shaman. Modern Day Chicago: After an unusual statue arrives in a current-day Chicago law firm, three attorneys fall under the influence of a supernatural entity. After one of the lawyers is killed, the burden falls on the founding partner, Bernard Gregory, to unravel the mystery. Along the way, Bernard discovers that his 14-year-old daughter Tina has driven a nail and sworn a sacred oath. The lives of everyone that Bernard loves depend on what he does next.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584479</url></doc>
