<plot>One of the very best of our fire-run films. The entire fire department of Springfield, Mass., is shown. First the Chief dashes by at a terrific pace, closely followed by the Assistant Chief. Next following the chemical engines, steamers, trucks, ladders and water-tower. Very exciting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511677</url></doc>
