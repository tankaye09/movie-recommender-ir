<plot>Rhodopian people say: Mountain without a spring is like a woman without a heart. This phrase of the documentary ties down as a cosmic whole the springs and natural phenomenon near the Arda River, the history of the people there and their wood-cutters and builders' skills that have left Agush's resting places to the generations. Autors come near to the truth of Rhodopian people's life, which is imposed not only by the social standing but also by the natural laws of the Rhodope Mountains, without posting up of any ethnic understanding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044866</url></doc>
