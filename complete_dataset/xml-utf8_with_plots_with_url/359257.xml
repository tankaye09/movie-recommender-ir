<plot>Sub-Inspector Rane is a honest and diligent Police Officer. He comes to know that a gangster by the name of P.C. Mathur is behind numerous criminal dealings and gets a warrant for his arrest. Before he could arrest Mathur, he himself gets arrested for murder, is tried in Court, and sentenced to seven years in prison. After the end of his prison term, Rane becomes an underworld figure known as Rana, and his main motive is to locate Mathur at any cost and kill him. But the wily Mathur manages to elude him. Then Rana hires a young man named Jai to kill Mathur. Jai accepts this assignment, but ends up killing another man by the same name. Jai decides to give him a life of crime so that he can atone this killing by looking after the blind daughter, Rajni, and widow of Mathur, leaving Rana alone to fend himself against Mathur and his growing gang of criminal elements, including Sonu, Ricku, and Daulat alias D.K.. The question remains will Mathur and his men permit Rana to hunt them down, or will they kill him before that happens?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?359257</url></doc>
