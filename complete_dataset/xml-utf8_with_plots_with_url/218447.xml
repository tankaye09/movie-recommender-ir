<plot>Portrait of a petty criminal. A young man sits at a nearly empty table in a barren room telling his life story and what brought him first to a life of serious crime and now to a more moderate life. As he talks - about his childhood as one of six children, about being a thief, and about being in prison - there are flashbacks to those rooms where he has lived his life. Now he gets by without doing "crime crime," but by doing things that are not 100 percent legit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218447</url></doc>
