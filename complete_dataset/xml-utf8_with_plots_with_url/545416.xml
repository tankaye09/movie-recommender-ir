<plot>The Bottom is the story of Seth, a teenage boy working at a remote gas station in the decaying, rural landscape of the southern United States. Seth, the modern-day equivalent of Bellerophon from Greek mythology, looks for fun and adventure, finding it in the few, yet intriguing customers who visit his station. Isolated and restless, his ambition turns to mischief, and the story Seth creates to escape his situation will lead him to a place where he feels more trapped than ever before. The Bottom attempts to recapture a mythological image for its original, intended use as a story device rather than a symbol of industry. It is a moving tale, reminding us that the line between fact and fiction, humor and tragedy, is a faint one; and those who choose to walk it can suddenly find themselves on the wrong side.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545416</url></doc>
