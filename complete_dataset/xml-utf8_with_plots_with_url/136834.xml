<plot>It is incomprehensible that in a country as rich as America nearly 46 million people don't have access to basic health care. For those that do, treatment within the American health care industry can be costly, ineffective, inefficient and sometimes deadly. Denied: Health Care Crisis in America addresses one of the most complex and critical issues facing America today-a health care system so badly broken that millions go without coverage and some 18,000 people die each year as a result. This film, by the award-winning documentary team of writer/director Julie Winokur and photographer Ed Kashi, recounts the toll on individuals and entire communities of having close to 47 million Americans living without health coverage. Denied tells the story of the uninsured through the eyes and emotions of those struggling to get adequate care and those fighting to deliver care with strained resources. It examines the convoluted disincentives to streamlining the system, and the innovative reforms being introduced to address the problem.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?136834</url></doc>
