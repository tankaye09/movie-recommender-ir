<plot>Ethan Miller narrates the story of the events that led to his meeting the love of his life. Through flashbacks and first-person narrative, we learn about his mother who made him the overanxious person he is. Though she is not always present, her influence becomes quite apparent in his approach to life and decision making. Reality has a tendency to bend as we get a glimpse of the inner workings of Ethan's mind. Soon he will be faced with a decision which could lead to his greatest fears, or finding his soul mate. In the end we come to understand that there is someone out there for everyone. For if someone this quirky as Ethan Miller can find love in this world, anyone can.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?182994</url></doc>
