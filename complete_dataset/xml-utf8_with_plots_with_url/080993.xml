<plot>A lively scene on board this popular war vessel is a boxing match between two of the sailors, who appear to know their business from the way they hammer themselves. It is not alone interesting as a boxing match, but also from the fact that the men are part of the crew who took part in that memorable naval battle in Manila.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080993</url></doc>
