Viswanath's personal secretary Radha (Simran) has several problems to deal with - an elder sister deserted by her husband, an unmarried and pregnant younger sister, an unemployed elder brother and she herself has a congenital heart. Vijay, who is used to western culture, has a different background and without any inhibition sits for drinks with his father. He has only one problem i.e how to blow up the riches piled by his ancestors. vijay decides to get married on a contract basis and how he achieves this forms the rest of the story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445218</url></doc>
