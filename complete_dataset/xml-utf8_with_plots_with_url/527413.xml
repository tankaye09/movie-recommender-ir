<plot>It's what dreams are made of: buy anything you want and more. But for some, winning the lottery is not all champagne, limousines and mansions, and brings only misery and regret. The sudden influx of cash can lead down a dark road to drugs, bankruptcy and even death. Why does blissful prosperity rarely ensue? Are those who win big truly destined for doom? Uncovering the stories behind 10 real-life lucky ticket holders, E! sits with lottery winners, their friends and family, as well as financial planners and lottery experts, to find out why some who score jackpot rise to the top, while others fall rock bottom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?527413</url></doc>
