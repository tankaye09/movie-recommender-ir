<plot>When groom-to-be Shane gets a fully-loaded minivan as a gift from his in-laws, he feels strangely disconcerted. It's not until his best man Graeme, the brother of the bride, returns home from abroad and takes him for "stag and eggs," that Shane realizes he doesn't want to get married. Blood is shed and lives are jeopardized over whether Shane has cold feet or if it runs deeper. With only Penny, the psychic stripper on his side, Shane has to decide how to follow his instincts without destroying the two most important relationships in his life... and the wedding starts in less than an hour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355513</url></doc>
