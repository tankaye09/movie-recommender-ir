<plot>Diana and Wai have become overburdened with debt, and in a scheme to make some quick cash, they put together a fake "family" to go on a reality TV show. Their family is pitted against another one, and they must compete to see who can live off the smallest amount of money. But as the game approaches the end, the show's producer forces the director to make a few changes to boost ratings, which may inadvertently expose Diana and Wai for the frauds they are.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226627</url></doc>
