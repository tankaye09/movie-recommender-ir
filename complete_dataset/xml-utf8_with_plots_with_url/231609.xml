<plot>A scene never to be forgotten is one where the fishermen are hauling in the huge seines loaded with fish. An amusing incident occurred while the operator was taking this scene, and one that perhaps would not occur again in a hundred years. A large Chinook Salmon escaped by leaping out of the seine. Just as the fish was about to disappear, a dog jumped into the water, grabs the fish and then the tussle begins. The dog gets the best of the fish and drags him ashore in full view of everybody, after the seines have been hauled in. The climax is reached when the men remove the squirming fish from the seines to the boat. The animation is one that can hardly be described. Finally, after the fish have been taken out of the seines. One of the most interesting scenes on the Columbia River is the hauling in of the seines into the boats, and one never to be forgotten by those who have watched the fishermen pulling them in. Our photographer was fortunate in catching this just right, at the right time, so that we are able to give the exhibitor an exact reproduction of one of the most interesting scenes ever taken.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231609</url></doc>
