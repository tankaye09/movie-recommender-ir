<plot>It is estimated that there are 13 million pet reptiles in the United States alone. That means that approximately 4% of households in the country houses a least one reptile, some have even more. In fact, there are even a few who have achieved quite a wealth with their reptile breeding programs. These people are known as "Herpers" stemming from the word Herpetology; the study of reptiles and amphibians. Still, the fact remains that there are two kinds of people in the world; those who are reptile fanatics, and those who have no idea that there are people in the world who are, in fact, reptile fanatics. Herpers is a feature-length documentary for them both, produced by the multiple award-winning filmmaker, Dav Kaufman who fits proudly in the former category. Herpers takes us from coast-to-coast from the forests of Virginia to the skyscrapers of Chicago to the hills of Hollywood and all points in between in search of this unique reptile culture. We visit with Reptile Breeders, Enthusiasts, and Celebrity Herpers alike in this entertaining, funny, and sometimes peculiar investigation into not only one of the most misunderstood creatures on our planet, but the "Herper"; the most misunderstood people on our planet as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?237302</url></doc>
