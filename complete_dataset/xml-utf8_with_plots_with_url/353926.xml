<plot>The body of a middle aged woman is discovered and a promising young police officer is assigned to this case. His name is Ataf and he is of Druze origin - a small sect of people whose religion is secret and who hold a firm belief in reincarnation. Through the course of his investigation, Ataf begins to experience some strange nightmares that carry him to his past. Soon after he begins his search for a clue to these nightmares, and realizes that the murder case and his dreams are somehow connected. More than that - the connection has to do with his former life that ended tragically when his present life began.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353926</url></doc>
