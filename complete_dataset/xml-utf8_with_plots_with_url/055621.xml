<plot>Narrated by Jeff Bridges, this film provides an insider's look at the Santa Barbara Bowl, one of the world's most beautiful outdoor amphitheaters in the world. The narrative takes us through the building of the bowl by Santa Barbara artisans during the height of the Depression, through a postwar period when it was almost torn down, and then into the 90s when a renovation effort enhanced it's uniqueness and created a venue with soul, intimacy, and beauty. The film also includes rare concert footage from the bowl's 2004 concert season, and scores of interviews with such bowl supporters as Rob Lowe, Julia Louis Dreyfus and musicians including David Crosby, Kenny Loggins, Jackson Browne, Jack Johnson, and more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055621</url></doc>
