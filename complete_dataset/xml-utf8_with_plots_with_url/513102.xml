<plot>The pioneering film experimenter Stan VanDerBeek at home discusses his work, found images, toys, inventions, the importance of his family and friends, and tours his "moviedrome" for seeing films against the inside of a giant hemisphere. He reflects on "film as an experience, not an artifact". "It is the aesthetic of anticipation, as distinct from that of meditation." Includes excerpts from his films "Will", "See Saw Seams", "Image After Image After Image," and "Poemfield #1".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513102</url></doc>
