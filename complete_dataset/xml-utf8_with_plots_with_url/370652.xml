<plot>Today, more and more millionaires are truly self-made and most of them are people just like us. They started off in similar jobs to us, attended similar schools and had similar opportunities. But unlike us they've made a million. By getting up-close and personal with twelve inspiring self-made millionaires, a team of psychological profilers will examine the character behind success, and discover what we can learn from them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370652</url></doc>
