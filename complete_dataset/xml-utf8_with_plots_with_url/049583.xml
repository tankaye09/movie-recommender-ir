<plot>The heart of Texas' capital city is divided by a river and a forested urban greenbelt with a spring-fed pool and running trails. It is also deeply divided between environmental protectionists and pro-growth developers. So when a 100-year pecan grove was clear-cut to make way for another in a series of downtown condominium projects, battle lines were drawn. Distilled from video and over 1500 still photos, the film takes the form of a fictional obituary for one of the trees cut down on May 21, 2008.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049583</url></doc>
