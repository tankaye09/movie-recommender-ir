<plot>Stricken by a near-fatal aneurysm 2 years ago, Katy is 90% paralyzed and completely non-communicative. No one on the outside can see that on the inside Katy's world is full of life even if her body cannot participate. Desperate to hold on to some sort of hope and normalcy, Katy's husband, Luke, lives in denial as to the reality of Katy's situation, but it is becoming impossible for even him to keep up the rouse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?537553</url></doc>
