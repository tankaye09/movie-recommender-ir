<plot>Eight families, each with an autistic child, permit a camera crew into their houses for 24 hours to immerse us in their lives. The film is loosely organized around themes: yesterday (when the infants developed as expected for a year or so), diagnosis, morning chores (breakfast, teeth brushing, getting dressed), stress and exhaustion, marital strain, siblings, finances, school, everyday dangers, being in public, and the future. Throughout the parents are candid, sunny, poignant, and aware as they talk while interacting with their children. Parents communicate the difficulties of their lives, the redefinition of their hopes, and the bone-weary depth of their love for their children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?051845</url></doc>
