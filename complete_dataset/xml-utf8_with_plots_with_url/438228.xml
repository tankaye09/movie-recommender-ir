<plot>Pomegranate is a beautiful story that unfolds with two male cousins, one who is a director in Los Angeles, the other who is a priest in Beirut. A family matter brings them together after 17 years. The priest is dealing with the fact that some of his loved ones were killed in a bombing and he has come to reunite with his family in America and deliver the bad news. The character of the director has to 'find himself' again through finding the love and value of his culture and family, to win back the heart of the woman he loves through his adventures with his cousin. There are great performances by several character actors (and a few non actors) playing eccentric family members. A ton of personality to these characters that adds a ton to the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?438228</url></doc>
