<plot>A young abuse victim runs away from home, eventually resorting to prostitution as a means of supporting herself while praying for the miracle that will steer her away from suicide and help her get started down the road to recovery. Abused by her stepfather, the young girl surmises that it's better to live on the streets than subject herself to the horrors that await her back home. But with each passing day her situation becomes increasingly dire, and after pondering the price of a miracle she decides to take her own life. At the moment of truth, however, a mysterious stranger appears before her. Could it be that her prayers have finally been answered?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?636034</url></doc>
