<plot>Domestic Flight is a dark comic tale of how Edie, a woman who has always seen the good in people, comes to see her family and her life as they really are. After years of being belittled by her crossword-obsessed husband and ignored by her greedy daughter, Edie has an experience that renews in her a hope that there is a better way, and makes sure that from now on things are going to be different.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154853</url></doc>
