<plot>In life, the big fish eats the little fish, and the bigger fish eats the big fish. To illustrate this basic truth, thirty-three animators each introduce a character who eats the one previously introduced and is eaten by the next animator's creation. It happens on land and at sea, with humans, animals real and imaginary, aliens, a few plants, and a robot. They are chomped whole, sliced, smashed, flattened, inhaled through straws, eaten from the inside out and the backside forward. Sometimes the little guy wins; nothing and no one is invincible. By the end, we've come full circle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335425</url></doc>
