<plot>This is the story of three horses born on the same night and charts their life stories. One horse is sent to a stud farm, but on the way it is involved in a car crash and escapes into the mountains. The second becomes a racehorse aiming to win. The final one becomes an eventer but doesn't preform well and finally becomes a stunt horse in the movies. This film shows all the ups and downs, success's and failures of the horses who started life together but now are completely different.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245945</url></doc>
