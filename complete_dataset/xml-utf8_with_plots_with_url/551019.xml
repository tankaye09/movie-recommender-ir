<plot>"This unique title is claimed for the yard of the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, at Denham Junction, and the picture was evidently taken from the cow-catcher of a locomotive which darts around the curves, and takes unexpected switches in the most surprising fashion. This picture is particularly interesting as illustrating the many modern safe-guards which are used to protect the lives of travelers on American railroads."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?551019</url></doc>
