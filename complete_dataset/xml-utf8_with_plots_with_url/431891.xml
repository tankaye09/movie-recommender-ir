<plot>A series of sketches with a shoe clerk, his wife, and his extra-curricular activities. The shoe clerk steps out on his wife with one of his customers. Both his wife and the woman's husband catch them when they go to the beach and later watch a beauty and fashion contest. His wife enters it wearing a mask. Back at work on Monday, all has returned to normal, until the winner of the contest shows up for her prize - a complete wardrobe. Later, the clerk mistakes the manager's wife for his own and sets out to revenge a kiss he sees them exchanged. A trip to the hospital later, the shoe clerk still has an eye for a peach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431891</url></doc>
