<plot>An empty apartment open for viewing. A Young Woman saunters through, giving it a bored inspection. The Real Estate Broker leads in another viewer, a Man in a suit. He leaves the two of them alone to look over the place. And so begins an edgy dance - a careful dialog of advances and retreats, of odd false notes and hesitations. Is the young woman a buyer or really a hooker who has mistaken the venue for her 'date'? Is the man, so deliberately inspecting the sight lines down upon the hotel across the way, a 'shooter'? Of what kind? And where exactly is this encounter headed? Though it is a self contained stand alone story, Nooner is also an episode from a full length movie project, tracking a varied group of people and their interconnecting trajectories over the course of 24 hours through the Passes &amp; Canyons of Los Angeles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400184</url></doc>
