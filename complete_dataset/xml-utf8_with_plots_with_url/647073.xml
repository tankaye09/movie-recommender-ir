<plot>Jacksonville, Florida - March 23, 1964. An African-American mother of ten searches for her lost wallet along the side of the road, as race riots sparked by protests against segregation rage in the center of the city. Oblivious to the violence downtown, Johnnie Mae Chappell searches with two neighbors until a shot rings out from the darkness. She will die in the ambulance before reaching the hospital. With little more than a few sentences squeezed into the coverage of the riots in the next morning's newspaper, the case would soon be swept under the rug of Jacksonville's legal system and forgotten ... until now. Investigative filmmaker Keith Beauchamp leads us on a search for truth and justice as he talks to Mrs. Chappell's children, the original investigating detectives, and other officials involved with the case. Piece by piece, we watch as he assembles the complex puzzle surrounding the murder, in an attempt to understand why justice has been denied in this case for more than four decades.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647073</url></doc>
