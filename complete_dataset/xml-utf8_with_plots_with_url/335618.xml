<plot>A most complete illustration of the perils of summer bathing on the Atlantic coast, and also of the admirable manner in which the life-savers perform their duty at our great summer resorts. A view of the beach at Atlantic City is shown, and one of the swimmers gets caught in the undertow, and is being rapidly carried out to sea. An extremely heavy surf is running, and the life-savers launch the life boat with great difficulty and battle out through the enormous breakers. Several times the boat appears to be standing almost on end and is with difficulty kept from swamping, but finally reaches the vicinity of the drowning man, where one of the life-savers dives overboard and rescues the victim from the watery grave. He is brought carefully ashore and the work of resuscitation commenced immediately.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335618</url></doc>
