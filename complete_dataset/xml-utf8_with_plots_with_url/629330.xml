<plot>Each week there's a main event, the winner of which gets to hit The Tower to win up to Â£5000. There are also littler events interspersed throughout the show. Anybody who wins an event wins a much coveted (apparently) Jim Fixed It For Me badge. Well that's not strictly true, they win a medal with Under Pressure written on it. Lovely. Big events take the form of giant and difficult obstacle courses. Examples include Super Biker, a bit like Kick Start but without the killer theme. Our bikers have to try and traverse an urban assault course (oil drums, bunny hops ladders and the like) as fast as possible without hitting the ground. Or there's Domino Run where our intrepid volunteers must brave running across the tops of giant domino like bits of polystyrene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629330</url></doc>
