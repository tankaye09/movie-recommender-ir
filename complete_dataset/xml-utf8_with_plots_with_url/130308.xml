<plot>On August 26, 2006, the sounds of legendary artist David Gilmour filled the air at the shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, where 50,000 cheering fans joined in commemoration of the world-changing events at the shipyard where striking workers were credited with one of the first organized efforts that eventually led to the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. Gilmour and his six-piece band are accompanied for the only time on their "On an Island Tour" by an orchestra: the 40-strong string section of the Polish Baltic Philharmonic, conducted by Zbigniew Preisner. It is the first live recording with an orchestra of Pink Floyd's "High Hopes" and "A Great Day for Freedom." The two-hour concert, directed by Gavin Elder, portrays the drama of Gdansk, set against the urban landscape of the shipyard and crane-filled skyline. Hung above the stages, suspended on two giant cranes, are six, 16-ton screens, each on focused on a band member and lit in a kaleidoscope of color and lasers by lightmeister Marc Brickman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130308</url></doc>
