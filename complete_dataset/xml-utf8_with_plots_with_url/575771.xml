<plot>In these troubled times, it's a brave man who accepts the challenge of taking on our corrupt and stagnant political system, and irreverent 18-year-old Jake Winterhalter is just such a man. In the town of Colebrook, the incumbent mayor has used public office to line his own pockets for the past two decades, but when he refuses to fix the public drinking fountain, he's gone too far. Enter free-spirited Jake, who, armed only with his wit and his wrench, single-handedly fixes the fountain and unwittingly wins the mayoral election. Now ensconced in his spartan mini-mall office, Jake, his girlfriend Abby, best friend Pecky and high school teacher-turned-trusted advisor Shipps, all work together to give their town something it has never had: an honest - maybe too honest - mayor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575771</url></doc>
