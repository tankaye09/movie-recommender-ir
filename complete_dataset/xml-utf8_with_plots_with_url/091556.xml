<plot>Josef Albers at 83 years of age in conversation with arts critic Grace Glueck. One of the seminal painters of our generation, his influence as a teacher of art in America has been enormous. Film excerpts show him at work and teaching at Black Mountain College before World War Two. He discusses his aesthetic, why he has concentrated on experimenting with the square, and the nature of teaching art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091556</url></doc>
