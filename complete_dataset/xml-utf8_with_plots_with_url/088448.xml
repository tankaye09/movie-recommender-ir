<plot>Mr. Magoo and his nephew, Waldo, are on safari in Africa with Magoo up to his usual near sighted tricks mistaking alligators for stepping stones and telling jokes to a pack of laughing hyenas. Later, when a lion gets a thorn in its paw, Magoo pulls it from the lion thinking him to be Waldo. This earns him the lion's companionship. But, unfortunately for Waldo, as Magoo mistook a lion for Waldo, he also mistakes Waldo for a lion shooting at him, treeing him, and finally capturing him in a bamboo cage to take him back to America with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088448</url></doc>
