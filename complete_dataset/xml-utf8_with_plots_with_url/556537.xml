<plot>The Fairy Tale This twenty-minute short is a "camp" fairy tale about a gay king who rules over the land of Hollywood, and just happens to be a hair and make-up man to the stars. He loses his kingdom by a spell from an old Hollywood star (Bette Davis), but gains life happiness by the assistance of his fairy godmothers (played by Patsy and Edina of AbFab fame). It ends with him finding the man of his dreams, getting hitched on the steps of City Hall and of course, living happily ever after.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556537</url></doc>
