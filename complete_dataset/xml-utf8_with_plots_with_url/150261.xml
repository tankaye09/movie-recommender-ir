<plot>Wealthy Ajay Sahni gets married to a woman, who passes away after giving birth to a son, Ashok. Shortly thereafter, he re-marries Savitri, who also gives birth to a son, Vijay. Ajay passes away suddenly, and the Police arrest Savitri, who is the sole beneficiary, she is tried in Court, and sentenced to several years in jail. Ashok is sent abroad to study, while Vijay is ill-treated, abused and beaten by Ajay's brother-in-law, Girdharilal, and his son, Mahesh. When Savitri completes her sentence, she comes to the rescue of a gangster named Mohla, befriends him, makes him her brother, locates Vijay, educates him, gets him engaged to lovely school-teacher, Rati. She hopes that when Ashok returns, they will be taken back into the Sahni household. This does not happen, as Ashok loathes Vijay and hates Savitri for killing his dad - and by the looks of things it does seem that Savitri and Vijay are fated to live the rest of their lives in abject poverty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150261</url></doc>
