<plot>Delves into themes of prisoner torture, humiliation and documentation, as well as the treatment of women in Islam. Situated in a claustrophobic dystopia outside ordinary time and space the filmmaker asks: What if every male Muslim had disappeared leaving only Muslim women behind? How would these wives, sisters and daughters feel after years of witnessing U.S soldiers humiliating, torturing and killing their loved ones / oppressors (husbands, brothers and sons). Would they be angry? Take on the role of "resister"? Would they be lonely? Would they feel liberated? And ultimately, Can the oppressed become the oppressor? This film explores all of these questions through a darkly disturbing, eerily voyeuristic lens.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384045</url></doc>
