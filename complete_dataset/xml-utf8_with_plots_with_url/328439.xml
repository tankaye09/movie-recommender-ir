<plot>"Legacy" is the story of Lawrence College freshman Steve Miller, a pledge at Phi Delta Tau, the hottest fraternity on campus. Phi Delts - dynamic super achievers headed straight for the top - are the envy of all. Steve, a middle-class kid from Wisconsin, is willing to endure almost anything to gain their acceptance. Anything, that is, except the truth. For our hero soon discovers that his future "brothers" aren't quite human and, through a case of mistaken identity, has been admitted into a fraternity of werewolves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328439</url></doc>
