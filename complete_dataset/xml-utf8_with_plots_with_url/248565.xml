<plot>Investment banker Owen Pitchell is tired of the marital bedroom routine. Tonight he will change that. He quickly gets more than he bargained for going head to head with his wife Robin, cracking wide open the very private dance of sexual politics. However, sex is never just about sex. Morbid curiosity and bitter wit is forced to give way for the painful intimacy rewarded the committed couple that refuse to be ordinary in the mundane. In the tradition of European New Wave, these charged performances play out in one voyeuristic continuous take, as playful as a cat with a mouse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248565</url></doc>
