<plot>Mike Martin (Wayne Morris) becomes a deputy United States marshal in early-day Texas because of his almost unbelievable marksmanship. (That he has a rifle with a special scope doesn't hurt anything.) He hates the thought that he has been hired as a killer instead of a lawman but his superior, Marshal Bob Scott (I.Stanford Jolley), sets him straight. For years a master gang of rustlers has raided government grazing lands and Lieutenant-Governor Watson (Tom Powers) orders Scott to get them. Scott, disguised as a prospector, is killed when he spots the outlaws deep in the Sangre de Christo range. Head of the rustlers is rancher Champ Wylie (Frank Ferguson) and his gang includes his foreman Santee (Rick Vallin) and a crack gunman, Kincaid (Robert Bice). Visiting Wylie is his novelist niece Jane Warren (Elena Verdugo). When Scott is not heard from, Mike, also posing as a prospector, goes to find him, and meets Jane. He eventually solves the rustling mystery, but is recognized as a lawman. In a gun battle in the hills, Mike kills Wylie and his men, and ends up with Jane in his arms.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575327</url></doc>
