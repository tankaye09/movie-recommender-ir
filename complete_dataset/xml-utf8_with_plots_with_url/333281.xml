<plot>Lonely, divorced and isolated from his own daughter, Walter is a middle-aged man with little purpose in life. Seeking companionship one night, he hires a young prostitute to keep him company. Walter seems less interested in sex with the young girl and an unexpected phone call from his own adolescent daughter interrupts the encounter before any boundaries are crossed. When Walter picks up his daughter Rachel, whose car broke down, the underlying tension is palpable. Rachel has clearly been deeply affected by her parent's divorce as well as the absence of her father. Walter genuinely wants to reach out to her but simply no longer knows how... Will another encounter with the prostitute help mend his broken family?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333281</url></doc>
