<plot>Two Murders, two suspects..... Or one? For Troy Neil (Bobby Cavanaugh) it's one, until he finds out that he's a murder suspect accused of killing his girlfriend. Confused, scared and raging out of control he looks for someone to turn to, but finds that no matter where he goes he's haunted by the menacing man who he saw commit these murders; A man sadistic enough to spill his own brother's blood! Looking through CHANDELIER and struggling with images of the truth, he tries to make sense of what's happening to him. When everything does fall into place, he realizes that these twisted and intense scenarios were just figments of his imagination.... Or, were they?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099488</url></doc>
