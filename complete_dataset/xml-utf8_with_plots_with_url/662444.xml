<plot>Xavier is plagued by a mind that haunts him with memories of his wife's horrible murder, and burdened by a heart that searches for a new life. Xavier's escape from his nightmarish past seems confusing and futile; until the curse of fate presents him another route to personal redemption. Unable to live with an alternate identity in the everyday, colorless world, Xavier creates a new ego upon returning to his hometown. Darkness again befalls this tragic antihero, who channels his fury into an obsessive plot of revenge that becomes intertwined with the rise of Tony. This shadowy collaborator provides Xavier with the information he seeks, but nudges Xavier to unwittingly descend into a criminal underworld. Xavier's revenge initially comforts him with clarity and purpose, but his chronic torment is magnified as he reflects on the prospect of taking the life of a husband and father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662444</url></doc>
