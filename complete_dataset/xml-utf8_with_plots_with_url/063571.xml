<plot>During the Canadian federal election of 2004 a right-wing Christian group, Focus On The Family, released advertisements in newspapers depicting a group of white, heterosexual families and a caption that read: "We believe in mom and dad. We believe in marriage." In this provocative documentary openly gay filmmaker John Ibbitson explores whether the ad constituted hate propaganda against homosexuals and challenges the definitions of marriage and family. John also attempts to contact Focus On The Family to press the issue. Behind Closed Doors reveals that there may be many types of families, but all families, traditional or otherwise, are guided by the same principle of love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063571</url></doc>
