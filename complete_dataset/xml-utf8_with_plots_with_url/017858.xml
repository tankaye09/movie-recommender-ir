<plot>A VISION OF BLINDNESS is a provocative and comprehensive look into the creation of the major motion picture Blindness, directed by Fernando Meirelles and adapted from the acclaimed novel by Nobel Laureate Jose Saramago. Culled from nearly a hundred hours of material, the documentary includes extensive interviews with Fernando, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Gael Garcia Bernal, Danny Glover and the entire crew and supporting cast. The film also features unprecedented on-set access in Canada, Uruguay and Brazil, this documentary is the ultimate "making-of" experience. Every department of production has been documented at work, from private "blindness training workshops" with key cast and numerous background performers, to the inner workings of Fernando's "City of God" production collaborators, featuring the cinematography, production design, visual effects, editing, and sound design teams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017858</url></doc>
