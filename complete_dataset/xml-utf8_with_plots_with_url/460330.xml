<plot>A filmed performance of the stage act, Reno: Rebel Without a Pause, which opened in New York City in October 2001. The show features Latina lesbian comic, Reno, as she take on the challenge of dealing with September 11th in public. Her rapid-fire witness to the events of September 11th and how they affected her personally and in the context of the world at-large became an emotional and cathartic work that drew beleaguered crowds (including local policemen and firefighters) searching for a way to process the complexity of the pain and find a way back to laughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?460330</url></doc>
