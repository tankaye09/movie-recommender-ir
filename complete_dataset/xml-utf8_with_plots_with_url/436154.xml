<plot>A hen's chicks hatch, but one of them is actually an ostrich. She treats it as her own, but the ostrich keeps getting into trouble, first getting stuck after eating a goldfish, then falling down steps into a basement and swallowing a car jack, then having a little run-in with a worm and a lawn sprinkler, and finally getting captured by the weasel. The weasel sings a version of the title song, with lyrics about how great the ostrich will be when it's cooked. Meanwhile, the ostrich swallows first the hanging light bulb; when forced to disgorge that, he swallows a box of fireworks, which goes off when the ostrich is in the oven. The weasel, having had enough, sets the ostrich free. The ostrich puts on a fireworks show, ending with "eat at Sloppy Joe's."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436154</url></doc>
