<plot>A realistic representation of the bombardment of Port Arthur by the Japanese. The great iron clad monsters of the deep are seen to glide in and out firing at the Russians, who are inland. The water effect is grand, and the mines are seen to explode, throwing thousands of tons of water high into the air; ships are seen to burst into flame and sink from sight, leaving the crew to fight their way to shore, some of them being shot by the Russians from the fort. A most exciting picture and of timely interest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078381</url></doc>
