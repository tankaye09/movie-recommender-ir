<plot>Elmer and Fannie Blue (Ray Hughes and Dorothy Gulliver) are happy that their neighbors in the duplex apartment next door, that shares an interior wall, have vacated and are looking forward to having newer and nicer neighbors. Then, Oscar Black and his wife (Harry Gribbon and Vivien Oakland, who was billed as Vivian Oakland) move in, but not with out borrowing money from the Blues to pay the movers, and Oscar keeps the change. Oscar them invites his whole gang of friends over for a party but since the utilities haven't been turned on in the Black's side of the duplex, he and his friends have the party at the Blues. The latter's apartment is soon a shambles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069555</url></doc>
