<plot>shortly after Saudamani's birth, her dad passes away, leaving her in the care of her widowed mom, who re-locates to live with her elder brother in a small town. It is here that Saudamini grows up, goes to school, and attends arts college. She is in love with her neighbor, Narendra, and hopes to marry him soon. But her mom and uncle have chosen Ghanshyam, a matriculate, who lives in another town, as her to-be husband. Her uncle passes away, and shortly thereafter Saudamini gets married &amp; re-locates to Ghanshyam's house, who lives with his step-mother, step-brother, Nikhil and his wife, Shobha; and an unmarried step-sister, Charusheela. Saudamani detests Ghanshyam at first, but feels sorry for him when she witnesses that while he does all the work, he is ignored by the rest of the family and the servants. She changes all that and slowly starts to admire, respect, and fall in love with him. Ghanshyam also reciprocates. Everything changes when Narendra comes to visit with a hope of reviving his romance with Saudamani. Watch what happens when Ghanshyam's mom sees Narendra and Saudamani holding hands in broad daylight in everyone's presence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?524541</url></doc>
