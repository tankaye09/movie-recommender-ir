<plot>Spanish Harlem For Love or Money, a dR3 production is Half Baked meets Desperado. A cast of SAG actors, International super-models, famed stand-up comedians and real NYC music have come together to make one of the coolest films of the year. dR3 set out to answer the important question. What happens when you mix beautiful women, angry Rasta's, no-nonsense Mobsters and a crazed Latino gang together in the heart of Spanish Harlem? The film answers this as it takes you on a hysterical tour of New York City through the eyes of a playboy Nemo. He's your typical player, but he's about to find out he played a little too hard after getting two girls pregnant (both daughters of mobsters), he's a marked as a dead man by both the Latino and Italian gangs. In the middle of all this, Nemo along with his best friend TTC have one hour to pay Ju Ju, The Rasta King of Harlem 125th St Nemo and New York will never be the same. Spanish Harlem, a serious Action-Comedy in the hood will make you laugh on the edge of your seat and leave you wanting more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509176</url></doc>
