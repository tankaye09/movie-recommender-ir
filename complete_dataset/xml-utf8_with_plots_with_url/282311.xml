<plot>Rick and Paige Wheeler are a young couple living in Western Massachusetts. Paige is pregnant with their first child - a situation which Rick, already struggling to live up to a standard he feels he ought to meet for his family, reacts to with fear. Rick's anxieties come to the surface when the pair set out on a road trip to his wife's parents' house for a baby shower - he's certain that he does not to measure up in their eyes to what he ought to be providing for their daughter. Paige, a reluctant passenger in the midst of an unusually intense bout of morning sickness, becomes the unfortunate target of all of Rick's woes. Driving down a road that he himself does not want to be on, Rick becomes a monster to himself and his loved one. This time, there may be consequences to his behavior.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282311</url></doc>
