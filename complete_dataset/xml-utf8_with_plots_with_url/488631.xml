<plot>"Sex, Drugs, and Comedy" is a multicultural laugh riot for the YouTube generation. It is a raw, inside look at life on the road with some of the most brilliant up and coming comedians in the country. From New York to L.A., from Vermont to Vegas, from Boston to Bermuda, filmmaker Ralph Richardson takes you deep inside the lives of these very funny comics. When a comedian's car runs out of gas, his promoter takes over his hotel room to have sex with a groupie, and an unexpected snowstorm threatens to push his on-the-road budget past empty, you wonder why any of them do it. With "Sex, Drugs, and Comedy," see their trials and tribulations, their pain and suffering, their joys, and their ultimate sacrifice just to make you laugh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?488631</url></doc>
