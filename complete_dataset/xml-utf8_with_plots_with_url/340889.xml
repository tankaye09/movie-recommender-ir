<plot>Joe drives a tow truck for a British Columbian town and lives a lonely life. He's reviled on the streets for towing illegally-parked cars, and he comes home daily to an empty flat. One day he sees a dog locked in a car. The dog makes eye-contact with Joe, and they seem to connect. Two men approach the car, circle it, then try to take the dog. The dog bites one, and the would-be thieves retreat. Joe rescues the dog, which is willing to leave with him. When Joe finds that the dog has an injury, it's off the vet's office, where Joe must face truth and the possible return of loneliness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340889</url></doc>
