<plot>A tumbler of Scotch in his hand, a man stares out into the night from the studio apartment he's just rented. His door is open, and a young woman who lives with her mother down the hall stops in to ask him a favor. She's in constant motion, smoking, fidgeting, asking questions, looking through his flat. He's still, laconic. She tells him she's a high-school senior, he tells her he's just separated from his wife after a ten-year marriage. She talks about her plans to travel after graduation; he's a loose ends. Slowly they move closer to each other; only the tumbler of whisky is between them. It's two in the morning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622987</url></doc>
