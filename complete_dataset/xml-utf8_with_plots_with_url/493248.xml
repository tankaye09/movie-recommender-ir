<plot>In the world of the Ninja, skill plays only a small role in determining one's rank. Kageru is strong, fast and extremely intelligent-the best in his class. However, his birth predestines him to the lower class of Shinobi. His friend Aoi finds herself in the same situation, and together they will be forced to question not only themselves but also some of the most sacred edicts of the Shinobi hierarchy. Because of this, a choice must be made; will they choose to follow their mission as dictated by the Law of Shinobi or break the age-old code and change their destinies?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?493248</url></doc>
