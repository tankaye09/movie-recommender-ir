<plot>This Polish death metal band was formed in 1996 when the average age of the band members was just 14. All attending the music school, yet facing ridicule with the release of their debut demo ("Cemeteral Gardens", June '97) due to their young age, they succeeded in gaining respect with a sound that convinced many that Decapitated is not just another ordinary band. Today Decapitated return with their first official DVD release. The main feature of the DVD consists of the band's gig in Krakow (October 2002), which was a part of their European tour along with Vader and Krisiun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134474</url></doc>
