<plot>Wakefield details the story of Ryan Wakefield, a boy living in suburban Sydney. Ryan has lived a normal life until his 16th birthday when his father brought him the gift he wanted most in exchange for letting his father touch him. Ryan didn't expect that this sexual encounter would change his life completely. He couldn't tell anyone, including those who cared for him the most;his girlfriend, his mother and his best friend. One night, Mrs. Wakefield could not take it any longer. She packed her bags, kissed Ryan good bye and left her husband. She thought Mr. Wakefield could provide a better life for Ryan as she had no income and no means of support. Little did she know that she would be pushing her son into a life of absolute horror. Ryan became tortured by his secret. His grades began to fall sharply and his relationship with Jennifer reached it's lowest points as he became introverted and unable to be touched by her. Max, Ryan's best friend, reached out to him, which finally allowed Ryan to pour out his heart. One afternoon as Ryan was preparing for a date with Jennifer, Mr. Wakefield entered his room for sex. Ryan refuses and is struck by his father before being raped by the one man he once trusted and looked up to. Out of rage and pain, Ryan steals a gun from Max's grandfathers collection before heading home to confront his frustration.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?646168</url></doc>
