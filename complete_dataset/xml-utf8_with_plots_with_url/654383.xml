<plot>During the British Raj, a young girl is buried alive by her father and uncles in a Tamil town. A century later, a college stands at the same spot, and a series of unusual murders takes place - which the grapevine attributes to the 'wandering spirit' of the murdered girl. College students Anjali (Gayatri), Maya (Sherin), and Jeeva (Vikramaditya) are in the middle of things, all three are potential suspects and victims. Tiresome film, more evidence that Indians haven't got the horror flick right yet. Comedian Vivek reprises his standard role as overgrown student, spoofing Mel Gibson from 'What Women Want'</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654383</url></doc>
