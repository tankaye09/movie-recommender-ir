<plot>Three contestants, all between 11 and 14 years old, competed in this children's version of "Wheel of Fortune." Host Sidoni was aided by Cyber Lucy, a real-time, computer-animated "cyberhostess." The contestant chosen to start the round selects a category to a mystery word puzzle. While most of the rules were similar to the grown-up version, contestants played for points rather than cash. The wheel also contained a prize space and various penalty spaces "Loser," similar to "Lose-a-Turn;" and "The Creature," which worked just like the Bankrupt space. In addition, landing on a "Physical Stunt" space allowed the contestant to select up to three consonants by completing a stunt (examples might include using a catapult to feed plastic cubes to a dinosaur and throwing rings onto a pole from varying distances). The winner of each round kept whatever points he/she had accumulated; a short video, narrated by Cyber Lucy, often accompanied each puzzle (to fulfill the network's educational requirements). The highest scoring contestant at the end of the show played the bonus round for a bonus prize.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652551</url></doc>
