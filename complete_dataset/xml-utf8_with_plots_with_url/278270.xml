<plot>Rajesh (I.S. Johar) and his brother Gulu (Rajendranath) are two day-dreaming slackers, who live with their elder, unmarried sister, Saraswathi (Jeevankala). Rajesh dreams at night and also day-dreams of meeting a dreamgirl, and one day he comes across her in the shape and form of well-known actress Nalini (Sonia Sahani). Nalini instantly rejects him. Nalini lives with her scientist father, who is on the verge of inventing a revolutionary weapon that can eliminate any obstacle - big or small, including big buildings. Some foreigners come to know of this, and abduct him to acquire the formula. Nalini cannot go to the police for fear of losing her father forever. She seeks the help of Rajesh and Gulu, who are both clueless. Then Rajesh and Gulu unknowingly stumble on a fantasy creature, they call Pappajee (Polson), who possesses magical powers. But as things turn out, his involvement results in even more complications for the two hapless brothers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278270</url></doc>
