<plot>TESTIFY is a story about the relationship between a father, Pastor Biggs and his son Gene. After Sunday's service, Pastor Biggs is informed by a familiar, yet unannounced visitor, that it is imperative that he goes to visit his son. The Pastor and son meet and a new revelation is revealed. How long will Pastor Biggs hide behind the Church, the Word, and the Rumors? TESTIFY is a film about familial relationships, forgiveness, sexuality, and spiritual healing. We learn that one should never judge a book by its cover, and before assuming anything, one should always seek out the TRUTH.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536565</url></doc>
