<plot>Justice NOW! is a documentary about 13 students and their trip to the School of Americas in Georgia, USA. The SOA (also known as the School of Assassins) trains Latin American soldiers from all across Central and South America. Hundreds of graduates have gone on to commit human rights atrocities over the past few decades. Hundreds of thousands of innocent lives have been hurt by their actions. The kicker: U.S. citizens pay for it with our tax dollars. Fr. Roy Bourgeois and the SOA Watch have been calling to close the SOA since the 1980s. What started out as a handful of friends has turned into a massive protest of 20,000 human rights activists that takes place each November at the gates of the base. The documentary isn't your normal what's the story, lets tell you about it film. It digs deep into the lives of the 13 students from Loyola Marymount University. Experience the protest through their eyes. See their pain and what they had to do to overcome it. Get right up to the fence of the base. Talk with Fr. Roy Bourgeois and other Prisoner's of Conscience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282786</url></doc>
