<plot>Australian version of the popular American game show _"Match Game 73" (1973)_ (qv). In this game is two contestants - one champion and one challenger. Host 'Graham Kennedy (I)' (qv) reads a funny fill-in-the-blank statement (e.g., "Mary, Mary Quite Contrary couldn't make her garden grow with water, so she used *blank* instead). The six celebrity panelists wrote their responses with a word or phrase which they thought best completed said statement; the contestant was then asked for his/her answer. A correct match was worth one point each. Two rounds were played, with celebrities sitting out the second-round question that whatever a contestant they matched one of them the first time. The contestant having the most matches (ergo: 6 points) after two rounds (or after a tie-breaker if needed) became the champion, and played the "Super Match" for up to $1000. In the "Super Match," Kennedy read a simple fill-in-the-blank phrase (e.g.: "*blank* phone") to which a previous studio audience had responded; the most popular answer was worth $100 with the less-popular answers worth $50 and $25. The contestant could ask three celebrities for suggestions, after which he/she could choose one or come up with his/her own response (answer). After the answers were revealed, the contestant won the appropriate amount of money and that could win up to 10 times more (ergo: $250, $500 or $1000) by matching one celebrity on one more fill-in-the-blank question (e.g.: "cookie *blank*"). Contestants continued to compete until defeated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074255</url></doc>
