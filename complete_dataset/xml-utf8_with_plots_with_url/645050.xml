<plot>This is a little-known aspect of American history. WASPS was started by Jackie Cochran, who got this program off the ground to give women the chance to handle Stateside duties. They did everything but combat, and this story is about the first group of 28 female fighter pilots. Jackie knew that if this group failed, the controversial program would be halted, and so she made sure to recruit the top female pilots in the country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645050</url></doc>
