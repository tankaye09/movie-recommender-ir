<plot>In many ways, Artie Woods is a typical college senior: he's shy, a bit awkward, and is still trying to figure out how to fit in. But Artie has a problem that makes it difficult to interact with people. Since he was a child, Artie has been stricken with chronic flatulence, and while his good friend Bear accepts him as he is and gets him into a fraternity, not every one else is so charitable about Artie's frequent gaseous outbursts. Artie becomes infatuated with Andrea, a sexy co-ed, and to his surprise, Andrea seems interested in him as well. But Andrea is just using Artie to toy with her incredibly jealous boyfriend, and Artie doesn't recognize that Emily, a pretty transfer student he's become friendly with, has actually fallen in love with him. Billed as "the comedy that stinks."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046686</url></doc>
