<plot>Shankar is a hoodlum who lives in a shanty hut with his pregnant wife, Kanta, and makes a living as a career criminal. He prays to Lord Shiv that if he is blessed with a male child, he will ensure that the child does not take to his path, but instead grows up to a decent and honest human being. His wife does give birth to a baby boy, and Shankar loots the ill-gotten gains of another hoodlum named J.K.. A furious J.K. hunts down Shankar in an attempt to abduct his son, but Shankar takes his child and switches him with one belonging to renowned stage artist, Ashok Kumar. Shankar gets into a scuffle with J.K. and his men, killing one of them, getting arrested, tried in Court, and being sentenced to 14 years in jail. Kanta passes away, while Dharam is left in the care of a wrestler, Bhim Singh, and a mid-wife, Ganga. Dharam is taught to be a hoodlum, but wants to focus on becoming a singer, while Ranjit has taken to alcohol, gambling, and a life of crime under J.K. himself. After his discharge, Shankar finds to his delight out that Ashok has brought up Ranjit and both are stage actors. Then his world descends into chaos when he finds out that Ranjit is in fact Dharam, while his very son, Ranjit has taken to a life of crime. Angered at Dharam, he beats him up and asks him to be a hoodlum like himself, he also beats up Ranjit and asks him to obey Ashok and follow in his footsteps. Watch as things spiral out of control when a vengeful J.K. abducts Shankar and holds him hostage - the ransom - the dead body of Ashok - at any and all costs - and the person chosen to carry out this task is none other than Dharam!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143932</url></doc>
