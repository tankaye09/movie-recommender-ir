She suddenly realizes that it's been ten years that she's been married, ten years during which she's done little more than take care of her husband and their three children. Adnan is a simple, hard-working man from a good Aleppo family. And he is a model worker in the civil service. But his job doesn't pay enough to support his family so he moonlights as a taxi driver. This doesn't leave any time for his family or his wife. Imane takes to listening to the songs of Oum Kalsoum and develops a great passion for the legendary Egyptian singer. She tries singing herself, first timidly, then with more assurance and pleasure. Her greatest joy is to comb the bazaar for cassettes of Oum Kalsoum. She feels a surge of love. For her husband, for his children, for his parents, for his brothers. Her husband is thrilled by the transformation of his wife and encourages her new passion. His brothers, however, think she's gone mad: she listens to music, sings and seems consumed by passion. Could she be seeing another man? They decide to follow her...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054134</url></doc>
