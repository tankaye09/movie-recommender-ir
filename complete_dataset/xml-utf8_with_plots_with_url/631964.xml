<plot>After being caught in a particularly horrifying act of betrayal, Rob (MacIvor) videotapes himself asking his boyfriend Alan for forgiveness. What starts out as a short plea to get his lover back turns into an hilarious epic, documenting Rob's demented attitude toward relationships, his inability to be faithful and his equally strained relationships with his friends - all of whom seem ill-equipped and reluctant to help. As in MacIvor's award-winning theatrical work, the film is notable for its creative exploitation of form, searing social commentary and wry sense of humour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?631964</url></doc>
