<plot>RoboCop 3 is a side-scrolling platform shooter. You must complete several missions (such as rescuing your colleagues who are being held hostage), which are divided into several smaller levels. The levels usually consist of several platforms, and are heavily populated by enemies who shoot at you. You can gather special repair kits, which will be used to restore your health after you've completed a level. RoboCop 3 is more of a shooter than its predecessors, having more abundant and tougher enemies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465726</url></doc>
