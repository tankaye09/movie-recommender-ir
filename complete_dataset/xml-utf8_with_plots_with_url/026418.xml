<plot>Tali and Ori are a young Israeli couple. After attending their best friends' wedding, which ended in disaster, they have a big fight, which leads to Ori proposing. But there is trouble in paradise when Ori's conservative father meets Tali, and all hell breaks loose... After Tali destroys Ori's highly religious sister's life's work and 'offends' him horribly, Mr. Cohen feels his honor has been abused and refuses contact with his son, unless Tali apologizes publicly. Zidane is a young bachelor with nothing to do and a strong affection for weed. After an encounter with a prostitute he's reunited with since knowing each other in junior high, Zidane has a near-death experience and tries to change his life. After a failed attempt to reignite an old affair in Colombia, and a relationship with a beautiful doctor, Zidane realizes who he really loves and what he'll do for her. Omer and Yael are a newly married couple who are way past the honeymoon phase. Omer, a bitter man only recently released from the army, becomes addicted to marijuana, while Yael waits for him to agree to have a baby. While he's planning to become a bachelor again, Yael meets an Arabic drug dealer and falls in love with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026418</url></doc>
