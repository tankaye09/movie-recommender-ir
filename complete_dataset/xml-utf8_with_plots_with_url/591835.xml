<plot>A man in black tie and tails enters a high-society parlor where a settee sits beneath an open window. He goes to the window and gestures to someone. From outside, a man in a burglar's outfit (watch cap, wide striped shirt, and dark jacket) appears and gets his instructions from the man in tails. A woman wearing a jeweled tiara enters with a second man who leaves her in the company of our mastermind. He sits her on the settee, chats her up, leaning toward her with one arm curling behind her head. He lifts off the tiara and waves it out the window for his partner in crime. Will she miss it? Will she catch them in the act?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?591835</url></doc>
