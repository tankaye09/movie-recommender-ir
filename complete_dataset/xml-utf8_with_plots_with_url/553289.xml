<plot>Peter and Bobby Farrelly have single, or rather double-handedly reinvented the comedy. Their films Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal and Me, Myself &amp; Irene combined shocking-but-hilarious gross-out humor with a sweet love story, and became blockbuster hits in the process. And in this interview, you'll learn why their writing methods of painting themselves into a corner and not wanting to know where a screenplay is going, can seem as unconventional as their comedy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553289</url></doc>
