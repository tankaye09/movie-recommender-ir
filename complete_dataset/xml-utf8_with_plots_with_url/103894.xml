<plot>Someone has left a basket with four kittens on Butch the cat's doorstep. He compares markings and quickly decides he's the father. This will not do, so first he tries burying the kits, but they were left behind when he picked up the basket. Next, it's the old Pied Piper routine; three of them fall for it, but the fourth takes a turn and crawls right into the house and the others follow. Butch catches the rogue just as he's rubbing against his mistresses leg. He stuffs it into his pillow and tries to hide it. The kitten gets out and Butch traps it in a large urn just as the other three walk past and head for mischief. Kitten two goes into the urn after unraveling the mistress' knitting; number three gets caught as he's climbing the curtains, and number four slip behind some books while going for the fish tank. All the while, the mistress is chasing Butch. With the full urn, Butch dashes outside, where he falls and breaks the urn. But lucky Butch his mistress likes the kittens.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103894</url></doc>
