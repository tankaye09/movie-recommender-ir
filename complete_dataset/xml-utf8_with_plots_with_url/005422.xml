<plot>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons and four outstanding violinists are the threads the filmmakers use to weave this exploration of how nature shapes who we are. As Spring reaches Toyko and the cherry blossoms burst to life, violinist Sayaka Shoji demonstrates to her young students the timeless lessons in the music, and in their own culture. Niki Vasilakis and friends travel from all corners of Australia to the Far North to share the music of Summer with the Thursday Island Community, as the monsoon clouds gather. As the leaves turn, Cho-Liang (Jimmy) Lin and his neighbours reveal to us their New York City's vibrant, complex personality. Finally, in the icy reaches of Finnish Lapland, Pekka Kuusisto and his colleagues bring the warmth of music and human interaction to the small local community. A documentary full of fascinating characters, fine music and glorious images as it reflects on the global experience of the seasons.</plot><plot>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons and four outstanding violinists are the threads the filmmakers use to weave this exploration of how nature shapes who we are.
