<plot>Light in the Darkroom explores the varying realities within an image and how such life is born. Beginning with the creation of light-sensitive paper, and concluding with the dawn of digital technology, Light in the Darkroom is a journey through the rapid and ongoing evolution of photography. The story is told by Fred Baxley, an all-knowing fictional character (and wardrobe chameleon) who acts as our resurfacing tour guide. From still photography to digital technology, Fred will point out the differences between yesterday and today. Along the way we'll stop to highlight particular eras of photography like the1960's, which brought about experimental darkroom techniques. These new techniques spawned a new realm of photography, hence, a new form of art. Photographer Jerry Uelsmann, an early pioneer of such techniques, shares the various themes and realities he attained with these new methods, which were completely separate from the click of his shutter. We also explore various forms of photo-manipulation and illustrate how the darkroom methods of the past have come full-circle to embrace today's digital technology. Light in the Darkroom turns to artist Maggie Taylor who guides us through our digital age by showing us how she uses experimental techniques to create the realities within her images. Light in the Darkroom is not your typical show-and-tell documentary. The purpose of this documentary is to entertain and inform the viewer with a stylized delivery of its content. We interview photographers from all corners of the profession, from portrait and commercial, to journalistic and experimental. We also interview the minds behind the technologies that photographers utilize, from Kodak速 and Polaroid速, to Adobe速 and Epson速. The artists and innovators interviewed for this documentary were free to express their bias toward whichever medium they prefer as long as they told us the reasons for their biases. For some, life in front of a monitor just isn't the same (or nearly as mysterious) as life in the darkroom. However, others feel that digital photography has opened a new door by which the practice can continue to thrive. When all is said and done, the message Light in the Darkroom leaves you with is that in photography, it's not nearly as important how you get to an image, as what the image becomes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336232</url></doc>
