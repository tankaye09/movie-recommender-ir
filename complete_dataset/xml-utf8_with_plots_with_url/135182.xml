<plot>Shankar and Shambhu are close friends, who live together in the same house with Shankar's mom. Shankar ferries people in his boat, while Shambhu chops trees for a living. Their friendship, habits, and hobbies are the same, so much so that both fall in love with the same young woman, Reshma. But Reshma gives her heart to Shankar, and decides to marry him. This angers Shambhu, and he decides not to have to do with Shankar and his mom anymore. Then the Thakur's new-found son decides to close the ferries, and operate a motorized boat. He challenges Shankar to a race, with the loser having to leave the community and the profession, to which Shankar agrees. How will Shankar be able to fare against a newer, motorized boat, and especially when the race has been rigged by the Thakur's son, and Shankar's new enemy - Shambhu.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135182</url></doc>
