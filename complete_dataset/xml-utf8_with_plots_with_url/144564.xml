<plot>Thousands of Jewish children lived in the Polish city of Bendzin before the Holocaust. Barely a dozen survived the community's destruction. Through interviews and rare archival film and photos, this critically-acclaimed documentary tells the story of three of these children-Ada, Shulamit, and the filmmaker herself, Mira. These women recount their memories of a childhood spent hiding from the Nazis and reflect on the courage of those individuals and families who helped them survive. The film thus not only documents a tragic historical period but also examines the complexity of human nature, undermining stereotypes about the behavior of Jews, Poles, and even some Germans during the era. The film's story involves Alfred Rossner, a German businessman who, like Oskar Schindler, employed forced Jewish labor and saved Jewish lives, but who, unlike Schindler, was not a Nazi Party member and paid with his life for his actions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144564</url></doc>
