<plot>Paolo is an unlicensed taxi driver with financial problems due to debts and lives with his mother. Saverio is a young man with a criminal record who wants to leave behind his previous lifestyle in the hope of winning back Maria's trust. Stefano is a small time businessman involved in illegal dealings. The three characters meet in the course of a suspicious assignment, which turns out to be a trap. When they return, everything has changed. Stefano's wife has disappeared. Paolo decides to take justice into his own hands. Maria has also left without a trace other than a crumpled slip of paper that a friend has fished out of the trash. When Paolo reads the paper to Saverio, it is already too late.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?627377</url></doc>
