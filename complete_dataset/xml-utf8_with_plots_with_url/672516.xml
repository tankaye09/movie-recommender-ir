<plot>Evidence of South Africa's shifting cultural identities can be seen on KwaZulu Natal's shores with young Zulu surfers emerging as keen competitors. 'Zulu surf riders', tells the story of a pair of second-generation surfing twins, Cyril and Mishak Mqade, who have made a life for themselves through this sport. Having grown up in a small community where employment is scarce and education lacking, the film documents the twins' journeys from their early endeavors to their present day successes. Cyril and Mishak are inspirational figures in their neighborhood, teaching local youngsters to continue on the path of the 'Zulu wave'. This film captures the lives of these brothers who, against all odds, have defied traditional taboos to bravely discover a new world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?672516</url></doc>
