<plot>With a war going on and tires and gasoline needing to be rationed, the man's automobile is not much use these days. So other forms of transportation are needed, each one suggested by an average United States denizen (each one, a Goofy like-alike). Some of these include a dog-powered vehicle, a cycle consisting of various feet which does your walking for you while you sit, children's vehicles which combine play with transportation, a golfer's "Model Tee" which you can use to "drive" to work (with a golf club), a politician's "pump-mobile", and a pair of roller skates operated by a handy magnet. But the most important vehicle during this time is... the pogo stick. The pogo's many uses are demonstrated and, pretty soon, the pogo will ultimately become the most popular transportation mode (though, obviously, since then, it hasn't!).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?639667</url></doc>
