<plot>Mayor Jim Blaine (Frank LaRue) sends for Pecos (Lee Roberts), a notorious two-gun killer, to run Brad Foster (William Ruhl as William H. Ruhl)and his henchmen out of Gunsight, after Brad lowers the "cut" he gives the mayor from his gambling place. On the way to Gunsight, Pecos encounters Johnny Macklin (Johnny Mack Brown) and is accidently killed in a fight after he tries to steal Johnny's horse, Rebel. On the road Johnny picks up 12-year-old Bud Hartley (Lanny Rees), brother of rancher Judy Hartley (Reno Browne as Reno Blair.) When Johnny arrives in town, the mayor mistakes him for Pecos and makes him the sheriff after Brad's men unsuccessfully try to kill him and Reno (Raymond Hatton), an old-time prospector and friend of the Hartleys. Judy refuses to speak to Johnny because he is working for the mayor, whom she claims is as crooked as Foster. The latter, Drago (Zon Murray) and other henchmen attempt to kill Johnny for closing the gambling casino, but their plan backfires and several of them are jailed. Drago is killed by Johnny in a gun fight and Foster is arrested. Johnny also orders the mayor out of town. Foster breaks out of jail, and a trap is laid for Johnny, but he learns of it and rounds up the whole gang. Judy persuades Johnny to remain in Gunsight, instead of heading for the road again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321609</url></doc>
