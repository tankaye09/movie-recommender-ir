<plot>"This picture was taken on the line of the Mt. Tamalpais Scene R.R., and whereas the previous views were taken ascending, this is a descending view, the camera being placed on the front end of the train which follows another train consisting of two passengers coaches and an engine. The trains run down very steep grades and around numerous curves. The background constantly changes; in some instances by mountains looming up in the distance and in still other cases by valleys with clouds in the extreme background. The background in this picture is very beautiful, in some instances white rocks showing, in others dark jagged rocks and in still others, trees and underbrush. The film is exceptionally good from a photographic standpoint and the constant changing of views makes it a subject of unusual interest, holding in its field during the entire length, the picture of the second train descending the mountains. The light and shadow effects are exceptionally fine and the foliage of the trees stands out clear and distinct. Sold complete or in separate lengths."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378720</url></doc>
