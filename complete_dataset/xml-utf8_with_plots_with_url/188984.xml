<plot>This program uncovers Mozart's character and explores the obstacles he overcame in trying to establish himself as an independent artist during an age when musicians were seen as servants to the rich and powerful. Mozart's years in Vienna (1781-91) were his most productive. There, he wrote his great masterpieces including the operas "Don Giovanni",and "The Magic Flute", the "Jupiter" Symphony, Quintet In G Minor and his last great work, the Requiem, which he composed just before his death at the age of thirty-five. The program concludes with a brief overview of Mozart's work which is useful to experienced music lovers and newcomers alike. The soundtrack features a selection of Mozart's compositions played by members of the Elysium Ensemble.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188984</url></doc>
