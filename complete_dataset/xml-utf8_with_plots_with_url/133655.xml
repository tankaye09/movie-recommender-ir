<plot>Arthur is convinced that his wife Rhonda is trying to kill him - accidentally. Through the re-enactment of numerous incidents recorded in Arthur's diary, we learn of the many 'accidents' that have happened to Arthur - seemingly orchestrated by Rhonda. Arthur records in his diary late one night that he must leave his wife the next day as he is in fear of his life. But the truth will be revealed before the night's end in a stunning climax.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133655</url></doc>
