<plot>What would you do if you were confronted with death? What gives someone the strength to survive? Is it luck, chance, instinct? I Survived allows survivors to explain, in their own words, how they overcame unbelievable circumstances. The subjects describe the experience that changed their lives forever and what got them through it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253126</url></doc>
