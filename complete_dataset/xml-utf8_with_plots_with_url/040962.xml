<plot>It was during a very frustrating first three years of higher studies that brought the idea of Animation to life. We were in a campus surrounded by forests and in a way trapped inside a very small physical and mental space. During the second half of the forth year at the campus we discovered the Erindale Park in Mississauga; we always walked through the campus pathway leading to the forest and onto a secluded part of the park. The place represented a moment of happiness. The lushness of the green and the warmth of the air really brightened our minds but returning to reality always took a toll. This swing between struggle and joy is what Animation is about, the dance of happiness and the withering of sadness to the point where they both blend and become the same and then part ways.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040962</url></doc>
