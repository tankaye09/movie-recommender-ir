<plot>The new "John Henry" documentary will chronicle the life and legacy of this remarkable animal, and will include interviews with fans, celebrities, dignitaries and other notables that knew him (or won big money from his successes!) as well as interviews with noted jockeys that rode him, including Chris McCarron and Laffit Pincay Jr. Still alive today at the ripe old age of 104 (in horse years!) John Henry earned over $ 6.5 million during his years as a racehorse, between 1977-1985. He was the winner of 30 stakes races, was voted "Horse of the Year" in l981 and in 1984, and was even included in People Magazine's "Most Intriguing People of 1984" roundup story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278417</url></doc>
