<plot>Delhi-based businesswoman Arti Singh Rathod lives a wealthy lifestyle along with Nanny, Suku, and friend and employee, Anuradha. She decides to travel to Kashmir and take possession of a piece of her land that is being occupied by Suraj Arora. Her Nanny tells her she was brought up by the Arora family until her dad, Karan Singh, became wealthy and broke off all relations with them. Once in Kashmir, all differences are forgotten and both Suraj and Arti fall in love with each other. Arti's life will soon change after she finds out that Anuradha, too, has fallen in love with Suraj, and this discovery will not only create complications and competitiveness between the two women, but also change everyone's lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432596</url></doc>
