<plot>All Hymie wants is to make good with his estranged daughter, Sarah, who's been living in Germany these past twelve years, and get to know his grandson, Dieter, whom he's never seen before. He boards a plane from New York to Berlin and meets Dr Moss, a man of similar size and age to Hymie who suggests they 'do each other a favor'. Dr Moss wants to spend the week in Switzerland with his lover without his wife knowing about it and needs Hymie to cover for him by staying in the plush Ritz-Carlton under Dr Moss' name, all expenses paid. For down-at-the-heel Hymie this is the offer of a lifetime, plus he can impress Sarah and Dieter. But things soon become complicated as Hymie finds himself being used as Dr Moss' puppet in a terrorist plot, forcing him to go on the run from the German authorities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?480640</url></doc>
