<plot>In order to unlock the mystery of her husband's murder, a woman must journey through the lives and circumstances of three distinct men - her husband's presence and the partial memory of his murder her constant companions. The woman first meets a young bar-owner, whose relationship with his father and leanings toward herself teach her the tragedy of dependent and complacent love. Next, the woman turns to a psychiatrist to rid herself of her husband's haunting presence and free the memory of his murder. Their mutual, passionate goal results in a relationship of mutual manipulation, but finally unveils the memory fully. Bent on revenge, the woman pursues a lead revealed in the unlocked memory. Her third encounter is with a surprising stranger, a private detective, who seems only to have her best interests at heart, yet is ultimately the key to the darkest core of the mystery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578358</url></doc>
