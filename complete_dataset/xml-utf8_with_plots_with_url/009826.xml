<plot>Shows an old sport getting out of bed after a night at the club. His clothes are a mystery to him. He puts on his trousers and is about to reach for his shirt, when, to his surprise, he finds the shirt has changed places with his trousers. The shirt is quickly taken off and the trousers adjusted in place again. As he reaches for the shirt again, it disappears from where it was hanging, and he finds it is on his body. He then attempts to put on his vest but finds it has mysteriously exchanged places with his trousers. This happens various times with coat and vest, but finally he manages to get things right, and goes for his hat. As he is about to place the hat on his head it changes into a water-pail. This is quickly removed and thrown on the floor. After a little difficulty he gets fully dressed and attempts to leave the room, but finds that all of his outer clothes have left him and he is again in the same condition in which he started. He sits down in despair, and again, to his surprise, finds that he is fully dressed. He quickly leaves the room. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009826</url></doc>
