<plot>17 year old Z.T., a brilliant mind and solid athlete, dreams of a great college and a future of invention and innovation. But he still grieves over his mother's recent death, a shoulder injury will likely prevent him from an athletic scholarship, and his father has squandered his college trust fund in bad investments. His situation is desperate. Suddenly Z.T. is confronted with ZACK, a raving, 67 year old alcoholic, who claims to be Z.T.'s older self, volunteering as a lab rat in the first experiments in time-travel. Zack has changed his identity to fool the scientists, in a desperate attempt to convince his younger self to avoid a terrible compromise in integrity, which will ultimately set him on a downward spiral toward ruin and tragedy. Z.T. is understandably skeptical, but ultimately is forced to consider Zack's claims. Together they attempt to provoke the old man's fragile, piece-meal memory, to find the exact moment and small choice that began the domino effect of Z.T.'s compromise in integrity. As they do, a unique bond forms, as Z.T. comes to value his other relationships from a much different perspective... one that considers the quality of man he becomes, fifty years hence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030865</url></doc>
