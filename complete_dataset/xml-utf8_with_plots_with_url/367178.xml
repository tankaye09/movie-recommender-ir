<plot>A light-hearted comedy about a young man getting revenge on his two most formidable foes; a girlfriend-stealing jock and a relentless Metermaid named Quincy. Henry finds out that his girlfriend has fallen for their school's most testosterone-enriched jock, Steve Slyker. The moment that Henry gets the bad news, his car is ticketed by the most ruthless of Meter Maids, Quincy Clarence III. The two occurrences set Henry off on a quest for justice with his best buddy Andrew, a lovable stoner. He concocts a plan that will ensure his triumph over the two by pinning one against the other. In the end, he succeeds and gains not only the respect he deserves by others around him, but a new-found respect for himself as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?367178</url></doc>
