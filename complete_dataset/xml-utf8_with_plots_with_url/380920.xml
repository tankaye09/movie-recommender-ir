<plot>The Naked Human takes you in a trip of human knowledge evolution from its basic and purest essence to its ultimate selfish completion. Once you strip the human nature to its basic conscience instinct it will emerge as it is and not as you may perceive. You will find out that the human brain is a vessel to contain any input it wants to feed on, and what makes it what it wants to be. The concept is as old as our early philosophers, from Aristotle to John Locks Tabula rasa.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380920</url></doc>
