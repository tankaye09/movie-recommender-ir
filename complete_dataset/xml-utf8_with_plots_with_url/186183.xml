<plot>A driver, train rider, and cyclist each ride 90 minutes or more to get to work in Washington, DC. "Extreme Commuting" follows the daily paths of these three professionals as they negotiate their way through one of the most congested cities in the nation. Jon lives in rural Virginia and drives on busy highways into the heart of DC, a trip that often takes him two hours or more and necessitates that he do much of his work on the road. Lori rides a bus and commuter train with her friends, who provide a much needed levity during the long trip. Mark bicycles across DC, often logging extra miles to spend time with his girlfriend, who cycles to work in a different part of the city. In accompanying each of these people on their daily rides, we learn the impact extreme commuting has on their quality of life and why so many choose to make the journey.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186183</url></doc>
