<plot>A man who owns a diamond importing business goes out for a night on the town with his girlfriend, her brother and her brother's fianc√©. The group stops by a circus to see the act of a trapeze artist who's a friend of the man's girlfriend. The performer suggests that all the men go out for a few drinks, and the next thing the businessman knows, he's waking up in his apartment with a terrible hangover and a dead body in his room. His "friends" testify against him in his murder trial and he's sent to prison. Eventually he is released and sets out to track down those who were responsible for framing him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570793</url></doc>
