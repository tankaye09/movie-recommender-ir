He only has one wish in life and that is to find love and when he finds it he will do anything to hold to it. Fritz Hess, a mysterious man who is filled with hatred. He believes he is pure and seeks revenge on all those who are not like him. Bernard, a single father who prides himself on being the "good guy". He dedicates his life to his daughter but has doubts every step of the way. Lisa, a spy, she is lost and misguided. After falling in love, she tries desperately to find a fresh start.
