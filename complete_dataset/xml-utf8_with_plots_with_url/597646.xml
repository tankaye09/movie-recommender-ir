<plot>This is one of the greatest comic films ever placed on the market. Two well-fed and prosperous looking old gentlemen are examining, with great interest, an illustrated theatrical paper, which apparently recalls reminiscences of bygone days, and the humorous nature of their conversation, is indicated by the amused look on their faces, and their thorough enjoyment of the theme. The facial expression and gesture revealed by this film, is a most wonderful revelation of the art of moving picture photography, and the comic effect is so hearty and infectious that your audience will laugh with you. This film is a new one and has made the greatest hit of the season.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597646</url></doc>
