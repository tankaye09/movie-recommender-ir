<plot>This is a compilation of three epiosdes of the series, "THE TIME TUNNEL". The first was the pilot about a government project. Which is a device that can send people into the future or past. When a senator sent to inspect the project and decide if it is feasible to continue, is not impressed, Tony Newman, one of the scientists working on it, decides to go through it, knowing fully well, that he has no idea what the results might be. He ends up in 1912, on the Titanic, just before it sank. Naturally, he tries to warm them but they of course don't believe him. Doug Phillips another scientist follows him. Naturally, they could not stop it. But the scientists back in the present were able to get them out of there. Their next stop is the 19th century, where some aliens are invading with the purpose of taking all of the planet's food. Of course Tony and Doug must try and stop them. And then, back in the present, one of the projects technicians, is a spy, he kills the one manning the tunnel and plants a bomb but is caught and before he could be apprehended escapes into the tunnel. Tony and Doug are sent to find him, so that they could find out where the bomb is. But before they could get him, he disappears, and not long after so do they. They materialize in the future. Apparently some kind of time warp sent them there. The spy is now working for the leaders, who have evolved into some kind of hive like race, creating a time machine for them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030181</url></doc>
