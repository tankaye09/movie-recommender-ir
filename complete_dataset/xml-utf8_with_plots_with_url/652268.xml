<plot>"What's My Line? at 25" paid tribute to the classic game show, where a four-member celebrity panel attempted to identify through use of questions that could be answered "yes," "no" or similar answer the occupation of the contestant. Except for one clip of then-President Gerald Ford, the special featured clips from only the 1950-1967 series (since the syndicated series, which had started in 1968, was not shown in every U.S. market). Clips ranged from funny moments and bloopers to inspirational and sad moments. Also featured were clips of the more famous mystery guests (whom disguised their voices in an attempt to avoid identification by the blindfolded panel) and some of the most prominent celebrities to serve as panelists. Three years after the TV special aired, "What's My Line?" creator Gil Fates issued a book about the series, titled "What's My Line?" The final syndicated episodes were just airing in syndication when "What's My Line? at 25" aired. Plans to produce a new version of "What's My Line" were promised as early as 1981 and as late as 2000; however, the newer versions never surfaced.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652268</url></doc>
