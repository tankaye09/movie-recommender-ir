<plot>Unable to cope with his condition of premature aging (at only 22, he looks 35), Neil develops severe agoraphobia. Dependent on a variety of prescribed pills, Neil has spent his entire adult life inside a largely empty inherited industrial building. Over time, his separation from the outside world translates into an oppressive solitude; Neil is uncomfortable even looking out the window. His contact with the outside world is limited to the worried monitoring of his scientist mother, an awkward friendship with a delivery man, and a relationship with his psychologist that blurs the lines between the personal and the therapeutic. Neil's spiral into self-destruction is only broken by the appearance of Anna, a mysterious woman who insists that Neil is her husband.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392492</url></doc>
