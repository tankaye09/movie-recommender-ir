<plot>Based on the filmmaker's autobiography, YOU ARE HERE examines the search for home within our era of transnational displacement. As the son of Italian immigrants, the filmmaker examines notions of home and belonging within the context of his ethnic origins, but also extends this in relation to his identity as a gay man. The film chronicles his trajectory from his familial home in Italy, to his native Canada and beyond, and weaves a compelling portrait shaped by memory and the realities of the present.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666207</url></doc>
