<plot>Lord Bluebeard is looking for a woman to become his eighth wife, as his first seven wives have all passed away. Many noble families bring their daughters to meet him, but none of the young women want to marry him. Bluebeard's great wealth, however, persuades one father to give his daughter's hand to him. She reluctantly marries him, and after a lavish wedding feast she begins her new life in his castle. One day as Bluebeard is going away on a journey, he warns his wife never to go into a certain room. When her curiosity finally gets the best of her, she realizes that she has placed herself in great danger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059177</url></doc>
