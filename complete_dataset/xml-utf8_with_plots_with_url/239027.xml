<plot>In mid-nineteenth century America, spirits knock and tables tip for Maggie and Kate Fox, two teenage sisters who convince people they can talk to the dead with their mysterious rapping noises. What began as a clever prank traps the girls in their lies as neighbors beg for the chance to receive messages from dead relatives through their s√©ances. Realizing that their "prank" has real money-making potential, the sisters hit the road to bamboozle newspaper editors, politicians, and the public at large and start a national craze for spirits and ghosts. Their fame grows-but could their powers actually be real? Both good and bad follows as the three sisters land in the limelight and come to their own conclusions about what's true, what's right and what's important.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239027</url></doc>
