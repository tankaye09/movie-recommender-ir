<plot>The clothes we wear affect who we see ourselves as and thus how we act. Or at least that is how fashion "expert" Angela Buttolph sees it and she feels it is important that those with a rather bland personae and personal issues tackle their problems by forcing themselves to wear a different outfit each day over one week to change themselves, open their hearts and confront their fears. In episode one of the series, we tackle Diane Metcalfe, a mumsy housewife who has lost her individuality in a daily routine of responsibility, school runs, cooking, cleaning and such. Angela forces her into a series of outfits to help her explore herself and rediscover her youthful spontaneity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018123</url></doc>
