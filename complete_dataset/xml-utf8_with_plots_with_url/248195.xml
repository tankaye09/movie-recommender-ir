<plot>Patsy Murphy comes home from work while his wife is cooking the evening meal, hands her his hat and coat and seats himself at the table. At this time the landlord, a typical Dutchman, comes in for his rent. Murphy hands him a chair, and bids him sit down, while he goes to another room and shortly returns with boxing gloves and insists on Dutchy putting a pair on. They have a warm time; the German gets licked and Murphy and his wife kick him out. The same old story, the Dutch and the Irish don't mix.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248195</url></doc>
