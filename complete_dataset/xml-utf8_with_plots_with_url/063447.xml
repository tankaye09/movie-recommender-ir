<plot>Dodger and Addie were high school sweethearts. She got pregnant. They got married. We meet them twelve years and two kids later as Addie is throwing Dodger out of the house for spending the grocery money on a stripper. That's par for the course but Addie later finds out there was more to his transgression than she initially thought. This time she wants a divorce. Dodger threatens to go on a hunger strike to make her take him back. As he whiles away the days in a dingy motel room, Addie finds comfort on the shoulder of Dodger's best friend Charlie. Charlie is a father figure to them both, a good man who tries to squelch his feelings for Addie. He is also Dodger's boss. When word comes down that someone in the office has to go, Charlie's loyalty is stretched to the limit. Dodger is the obvious choice but how can he kick a friend when he's down? And how will this affect Addie and the kids? Things reach the boiling point at work and at home, forcing each character in their own way to make a sacrifice for love. BEGGING YOUR PARDON combines romantic comedy and slice of life drama to bring you a fresh and original story of love, loss, and redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063447</url></doc>
