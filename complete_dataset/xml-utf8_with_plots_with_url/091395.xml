<plot>How do you remember the past? How do you forget? Welcome to Blacksburg, a small southwestern Virginia town nestled between the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Appalachian Trail, and home to the 54-year marriage of Calvin and Helen Perdue. Three years have passed since Helen was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As Calvin witnesses her continuing debilitation, the Perdue children, Michael and Peggy, must struggle with their mother's deterioration and whether their father's treatment of their mother in the final years of her life absolves him from the previous fifty. Can present actions make up for past mistakes?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091395</url></doc>
