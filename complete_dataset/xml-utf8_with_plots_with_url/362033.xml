<plot>May All Your Christmases Be Black is a DVD companion piece to the 2006 remake of "Black Christmas". It was made for people to see after they've watched the movie itself, therefore containing/revealing spoilers as to how certain characters die, as well as the identity of the killer. The piece seeks to gain insight from writer/director, Glen Morgan on the whys and hows of not only re-making a popular cult classic, but how it fits within his own career. Filmed fly on the wall-style, the featurette mainly covers Morgan's struggle, for good or for worse, to make his film commercially popular while still trying to include elements like a theme and tone in what is essentially a slasher horror movie. The theme of "family" permeates throughout the movie, but also behind-the-screen as well. "May All Your Christmases Be Black" also covers his unusual casting of his regular 1st camera assistant, Dean Friss, to play one of the killers and his experience working on the film in two capacities. Weighing in on various production elements, and on Morgan's directorial style, are his cast (many who have worked with him before), his producing partner, Jim Wong, and his wife (also an actor in the film), and various long-time crew members.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362033</url></doc>
