<plot>This provides a great insight into the genesis of the American production of the series, featuring contributions from Ted Koplar (President of WEP), Peter Keefe (Executive Producer), Franklin Cofod (Director), Marc Handler (Story Editor), Bill England (Logo Design) and Paul Vitello (Stereo Sound Effects). Naturally it covers all bases, from how WEP purchased the rights to the series and what direction they intended to take it in. We get a lot of input from each participant who provide plenty of interesting technical tidbits, which gives us a firm understanding of how an animated series is developed. It also momentarily gets into the series merchandising and television success, overall being a very solid inclusion for fans of the show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544147</url></doc>
