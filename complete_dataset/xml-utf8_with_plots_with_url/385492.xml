<plot>The smoke rising from the fire, twists and shapes itself to form the ghosts and demons of the Storyteller's yarn in this spine-tingling, but life-affirming tale about the relationships between youth and their elders. It opens with a ghostly encounter in which an aging Indian storyteller is visited by the mysterious owl of death, causing him to recall fond memories of his life. In his reflection, the audience discovers the wonder, magic and enduring importance of family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385492</url></doc>
