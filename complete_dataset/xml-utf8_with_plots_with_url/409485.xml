<plot>Before the advent of the steam engine and derrick hoist, the method of mining practiced on the rich creeks, was called "drifting and windlass" work. A fire was built in the ground to thaw out a quantity of pay dirt; this was hoisted to the surface by means of a hand windlass and then dumped into the sluice boxes. The extreme richness of the dirt made the method profitable, and in order to keep on the full pay streak, and prevent great loss of time and expensive fuel, sample pans of dirt are frequently sent up to be tested. All this is shown in this subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409485</url></doc>
