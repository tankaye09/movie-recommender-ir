<plot>This is one of the most remarkable branches of Great Britain's colonial forces and has been termed by Earl Roberts, "The Flower of the Indian Army." The men are not subjects of the King, their country, Nepaul, being an independent kingdom. This regiment served with great gallantry throughout the Indian Mutiny and took part in Earl Roberts's famous march to Kandahar. Photographed in parade formation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599875</url></doc>
