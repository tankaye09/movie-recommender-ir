<plot>An unsually interesting trick picture. Two girls are on a see-saw, having a good time, when the clown suddenly removes the support beneath the board. To his surprise the girls keep on see-sawing and the board does not fall, but remains in the air, without any visible means of support.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549214</url></doc>
