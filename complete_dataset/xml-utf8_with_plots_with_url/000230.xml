<plot>Widower Vikas lives a fairly wealthy lifestyle along with son, Raju, on an island off of Bombay's Gateway of India. Raju has not been told of his mother's demise, and believes that she will return home by the next boat. He is looked after and abused by Vikas' aunt, and manages to run away. On one occasion, in the company of Minoo, his neighbor, they manage to get on the boat, reach Bombay, and start a frantic search for his mother. With the help of the Police, Vikas was able to locate and bring them back home. When Vikas goes to work one day, villagers find an unconscious female and bring her to his house. She is looked after, and Raju believes that his mother has returned. When Vikas returns, he decides to let this female, whose name is Juhi, live with them - little knowing that she is a runaway prostitute.</plot><plot>Widower Vikas lives a fairly wealthy lifestyle along with son, Raju, on an island off of Bombay's Gateway of India.
