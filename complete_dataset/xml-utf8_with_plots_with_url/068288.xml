<plot>Paro, her mother, and her brother, Natwar, find an unconscious man near their town. They bring him over to their house, nurse and nurture him back to good health, only to find out that he has the mind of a 12 year of old child, and name him Bhola. Years pass by, Paro has fallen in love with Bhola, for he rescued her from a molester, and both would like to get married. Before that could happen, Bhola is viciously attacked and left for dead by Paro's molester, and is hospitalized. While in hospital, Police Sub-Inspector Abhimanyu Verma finds out that Bhola is not who he claims to be but a homicidal maniac, wanted for killing three policemen - named Bhisma - and is possibly masquerading as a 12 year old child to hide from the police.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068288</url></doc>
