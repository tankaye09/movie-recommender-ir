<plot>Secret Lives features an ever-changing cast of hip young adults with drastically contrasting points of view. As host Jenny Johnson chats with the newly acquainted group, their public personas are juxtaposed with intimate one-on-one interviews. This daring character study attempts to uncover their emotional core and expose the hypocrisies they live in their daily lives. Just as our guests believe they have each other figured out, the twist is revealed: one of them has fabricated his or her entire life story. Guests and viewers alike are challenged to unmask the liar before the liar unmasks himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483555</url></doc>
