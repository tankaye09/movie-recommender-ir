<plot>Dave is a simple, shy, lonely country guy with a passion for photography and a foot fetish. Since he resembles Van Gogh, he's searching for a special girl for whom he can slice his ear off. Dave chooses to pursue the foot models he finds on his favorite foot fetish web site run by a celebrity photographer Astrud Swan. He drives to New Jersey for his first date, but is too shy to approach the girl. His second date lives in Florida, so he takes a vacation to go there. But when the girl approaches him, David withdraws timidly. The third date asks him to meet her in New York's Central Park, but stands him up. Instead, he accidentally meets Irene, an older woman with big artificial breasts. She invites Dave to her place, and seduces him. They have an intense sexual encounter, which devastates Dave and causes him to question life itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200281</url></doc>
