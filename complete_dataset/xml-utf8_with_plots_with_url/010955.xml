<plot>Hardhearted Kate Comstock has always resented her daughter Elnora because her husband Robert died in the quicksands of the Limberlost swamp when Elnora was born. Longing for her mother's love, beautiful Elnora is easily loved by everyone else, including neighbors Wesley and Margaret Sinton and the "Bird-Woman" of the swamp, who helps Elnora raise money by teaching her to capture moths and butterflies for sale. Elnora does well in high school, too, and when Philip Amon comes to the neighborhood to recover his health, they fall in love with each other. Unfortunately, Philip is engaged to Edith Carr, a high-spirited but jealous beauty. Elnora seeks to avoid conflict with Edith by staying with Freckles and his wife, who also live in the Limberlost, but when Elnora helps nurse Philip back to health, Edith leaves them free to marry. When Mrs. Comstock learns that her husband had been unfaithful to her with neighbor Elvira Carney, she finally discovers in herself a love for her daughter, and extends her affections enough to adopt the orphaned boy Billy and his dog.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010955</url></doc>
