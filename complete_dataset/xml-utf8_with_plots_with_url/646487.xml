<plot>When Kyle's girlfriend Karen decides to take off to camp, it becomes to much to bare and Kyle feels he needs to go be with her. Despite attempts from his best friend Alex to talk him out of it, he decides since he is out of work and out of money, the best way to get there is to walk. Along the way Kyle must face the brutal reality of the journey he has embarked on...five hundred miles, is indeed, a very long way to walk. With the help of a convenience store clerk, a hallucination and Kyle's love for Karen, he eventually makes it, only to discover an unimaginable truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?646487</url></doc>
