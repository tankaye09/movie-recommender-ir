<plot>Sofya Kovalevskaya was a Russian pioneer for women in Tzarist Russia. She was the first woman in the country to become a Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It seemed that the whole world was against her accomplishing this feat. In spite of all the obstacles she later got a Ph. D. in mathematics. However she was denied a professorship at any Russian University because of her gender. She had to go to Western Europe for continuation of her career and studies. She had a daughter and family life. Sofya Kovalevskaya was eventually recognized in Russia. Leading scientists, like Academician Sechenov, took part in her education and career.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?504602</url></doc>
