<plot>Behind a narration in the style of Jack Webb on TV's "Dragnet", U.S. Marshal Sam Nelson (Bill Elliott as Wild Bill Elliott), posing as Sam Smith, is sent to a gold-boom town in California to learn the identity of three killers. Posing as a gunman and killer, he soon strikes up a friendship with card-sharp Alf Billings (Harry Morgan in his Henry Morgan days) after saving him from beiing lynched when caught cheating in a card game. Billings suggests they become partners as his skill with cards (overlooking the near lynching he just escaped) and Sam's ability with guns should make them a fortune. Sam agrees, hoping that Billings will lead him to the men he is hunting. Billings leads him to Coldwater sheriff William Norris (Lane Bradford) and Ernie Walker (John Doucette), Norris's partner in a saloon and gambling operation, both implicated in the murder case Sam is investigating.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558922</url></doc>
