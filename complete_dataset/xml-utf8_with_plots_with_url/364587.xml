<plot>Meitantei Conan is the live-action prequel to the current Meitantei Conan franchise. It's set before Shinichi was shrunk, or ever knew of the black organization. Shinichi Kudou is a famous High School detective. He lives alone in his huge house while is parents live overseas. His best friend and neighbor is Ran Mouri, who goes to school with him. Kogorou Mouri is her idiotic dad who's always whining about Shinichi taking his business, but it's really because he can't solve a thing. While most people don't think much of a high school kid, everyone around him knows his talent. "There is only one truth,".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?364587</url></doc>
