<plot>Amid an immense sweep of preserved rainforest surrounding the Capibaribe River in Northeast Brazil stands a monumental ceramic complex, the work of Francisco Brennand. The Temple of the Egg, with its ponds, totems, high walls and myriad living forms, is reminiscent of the wonders of an ancient world in which magic was ever-present. De Ovo Omnia is a unique opportunity to see within the mysteries of Brennand's controversial universe, accompanied by the artist's own revealing insights into his work, one of bewildering scale, scope and expressive force that juxtaposes the sexuality, tragedy, pain and suffering of all life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082664</url></doc>
