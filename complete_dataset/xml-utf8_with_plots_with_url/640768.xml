<plot>This documentary follows EMT John Randall through the rural areas of Pennsylvania. Every weekend of his life for the past eight years has been dedicated to other people in need of medical attention. He provides comfort and care to others at some of the worst moments in their lives. Most people will give a helping hand in times of crisis but John does this every weekend whether or not a national tragedy occurs. These are the people you trust with your life at any moment of any given day. They wait in a dispatch facility on their own time and unconditionally devote their skills to whatever the situation requires.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640768</url></doc>
