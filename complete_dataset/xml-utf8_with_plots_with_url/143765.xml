<plot>One of the funniest pictures we ever saw is this of the famous Devoy, of the firm of Loro &amp; Devoy, the comical acrobats. Just see him fall once or twice and you will wonder why he does not injure himself. He is not padded, nor does he try to break his falls as many tumblers do. He is a whole show in himself. Comical in the extreme.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143765</url></doc>
