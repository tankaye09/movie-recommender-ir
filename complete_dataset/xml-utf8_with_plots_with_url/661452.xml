<plot>"Taken in Havana Harbor from a moving launch, and shows the wreck of the 'Maine' surrounded by wrecking boats and other vessels. The warped and twisted remains show how thoroughly this immense mass of iron and steel was blown out of all semblance of a vessel. The background of this picture is formed by the shores of Havana Harbor, and as the yacht moves around, a panoramic view of the shores adds an interesting feature."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661452</url></doc>
