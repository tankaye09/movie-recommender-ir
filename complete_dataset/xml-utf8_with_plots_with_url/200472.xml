<plot>'William F. Rodgers' (qv), an MGM vice president and the studio's general sales manager, introduces this short. It highlights the films that MGM plans to distribute to rural exhibitors and distributors in the period immediately following World War II. Excerpts from five films are shown first. Then there are trailers for numerous films. Finally, several novels that are scheduled for future production are also featured. Some of the films have already been released in larger cities, while a few are already in general release. A majority of the films, however, were released in 1947. In a few cases, a film title was changed before release (e.g., _Love Laughs at Andy Hardy (1946)_ (qv) was advertised with the title "Uncle Andy Hardy"). Some of the novels mentioned have never been made into films. In one case, a novel's film version was not released until 14 years later (_Green Mansions (1959)_ (qv))!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200472</url></doc>
