<plot>The village of Stoovertpuram has always lived in fear and loathing of the police, who they see as a major force of oppression, and a toy of the rich, wealthy and influential, and will have nothing to do with them. When a policeman comes to their village, he gets the same reaction as that of a gang of thugs and robbers, with everyone running, hiding, and closing all doors and windows. In this atmosphere comes Inspector Rana Pratap, a young man who has grown in this small community, and who has vowed to change the way in which the police are perceived.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516436</url></doc>
