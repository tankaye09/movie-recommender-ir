<plot>Chuck Ritchie, tour guide and local expert on Canada's very own Loch Ness monster-- the legendary Ogopogo-- no longer believes in the magic of his own stories. A broken marriage and a failed career as an author have convinced Chuck that he's wasted his life. But in the eyes of his 10-year-old son, Eric, Chuck Ritchie is the greatest adventurer that ever lived. On Eric's birthday, when the boy insists on spending the day at the water's edge looking for the Ogopogo, Chuck decides to tell one last story that may change things in Eric's eyes forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408063</url></doc>
