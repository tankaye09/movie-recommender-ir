<plot>Manuel's long-time adversary, Salvador, owner of a local night club, holds the key to unlocking the secrets of Manuel's past that could destroy his family and reputation. Dr. Maria Hayden works hard to restore a life torn apart when her North American Anglo husband Frank, also a doctor, left the marriage for a blond nurse. Upon seeing Maria move on and develop a friendship with Ramon, Manuel's son, Frank begins to question his mid-life decision. Esperanza and Miguel Sanchez's desire to have the American dream for their four children is not easily realized. In additional to health and financial barriers, the family deals with acculturation issues with their teenage daughter, Christina. Gabriela, the oldest daughter, works at the "Latin Grill" to help pay the bills. She has dreams of her own including going to college.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402557</url></doc>
