<plot>The U.S. Battleship "Ohio" was launched from the wharfs of the Union Iron Works at San Francisco, Cal. Our photographers were sent to San Francisco and were on hand to catch a picture of this event. We secured a marvelously clear and life-like picture of the big battleship as she slid from the stocks and glided with ease and grace into the tranquil waters of San Francisco Harbor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321358</url></doc>
