<plot>At a party following a grand-nephew's Confirmation, ARTIE and CONNIE find a quiet table off to the side to eat their cocktail appetizers. They are both elderly, and Artie is deep in the throes of Alzheimer's. The two grouse and bicker as old married couples will, and the conversation takes many comical and absurd turns as Connie struggles to make sense of Artie's foggy pronouncements. But the comedy is always shadowed by the grim presence of Artie's illness, and the memories of happier times that will never be again. And when niece JILL reveals a crucial bit of forgotten information, Connie is left to ponder the darkness of her own future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216592</url></doc>
