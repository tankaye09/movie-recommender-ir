<plot>Golden Elliot is an independent drama film based on an Iraq War veteran returning home with more than just the brutality of war lingering in his mind. Twenty-three year old Antonio Vasquez joined the Marines with his best friend Elliot who lived next door. Upon Antonio's return, he must face Elliot's two sisters, Jolene and Amanda Marshall, who want to know why Elliot did not return home safely from war. As the tension builds around the question of what exactly happened to Elliot in Iraq, Antonio can no longer hide behind his mental instability and months of therapy. He is forced to reveal the awful truth about his best friend's death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218989</url></doc>
