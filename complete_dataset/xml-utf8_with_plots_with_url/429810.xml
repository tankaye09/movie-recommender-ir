<plot>Kate is a shy young single woman sitting alone at a dance. She is surprised to meet her friend Wanda there, surrounded by interested men. Wanda explains that her new-found popularity comes from "personality software" diskettes which enhance the user's personality. Wanda takes Kate to a shop where she purchases a "Confident" diskette. (Kate is warned that, as with all diskettes, the effect lasts for only 6 hours.) Emboldened, she rebuffs the efforts of her meddling mother to introduce her to Morry, a shy young single man. Later Morry shows up on Kate's doorstep, transformed into a suave man-about-town -- yes, Morry is now a personality software user too! But will Kate's and Morry's romance last after the effects wear off? And are there hidden dangers in this new self-help technology?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429810</url></doc>
