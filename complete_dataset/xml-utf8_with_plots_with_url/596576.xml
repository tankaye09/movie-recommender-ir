<plot>Best friends, Vivian, and Kelly, trek deep into the heart of Ricket's Wood to find out whether or not the stories are true about the wood's supernatural powers. They are about to find that Ricket's Wood conceals a much darker secret - one that will haunt them both for the rest of their lives. Fifteen years pass before Kelly, now an adult, tries to make sense of what happened so many years earlier. Her boyfriend, Tom, is unaware of what awaits Kelly once she returns to Ricket's Wood to rid herself of the nightmarish memories of childhood legend gone horribly wrong.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596576</url></doc>
