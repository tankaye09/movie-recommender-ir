<plot>Evan (Brian Ross) is your ordinary six foot, two-hundred and fifty pound man in cricket pajamas. Some would call him "special", others, "mentally handicapped." Left with the mind of a child, Evan now faces his greatest challenge when Bill (Gary Olinghouse), his brother and guardian, is called into work in the middle of the night. Bill's apprehension is evident as he leaves Evan in the supervision of Gary, (Matthew J. Christian). To Bill, Gary is nothing more than a free-loader and bad influence on Evan. Though there is no love between Bill and Gary, Gary is Evan's best friend. Together they set off on a night of "great moments". That is, until an escaped convict seeks refuge in their home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335934</url></doc>
