<plot>In a city seemingly full of happy people, one young woman walks about with a small dark cloud directly over her head. It follows her up the stairs and into her apartment. She tries slamming the door on it, getting rid of it with a vacuum cleaner, and dumping it in someone else's shopping cart. But the cloud doesn't leave her, until she meets a young man who has his own sunshine. Is love the way she's going to get rid of her cloud? Or will change have to happen from within?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109085</url></doc>
