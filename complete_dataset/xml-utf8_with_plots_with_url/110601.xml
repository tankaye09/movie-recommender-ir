<plot>It's New Year's Eve, and opening night for the highly anticipated "Coleridge's Couch". Backstage, nervous adrenaline runs feverishly high when news that a "make you/break you" critic is in the audience. The talented playwrite, Charlie, battles his inner demons, while his actors prepare and struggle with eachother. Director, Angeles Woo, paints a nuanced character study of the Coleridge ensemble on their night to shine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110601</url></doc>
