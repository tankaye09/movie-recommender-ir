<plot>Pieces of the Sun is the story of a young man's relationship with the woman of his dreams. The story revolves around his inability to discern between the reality and the fantasy of how she truly feels for him. The young man often speaks of his inability to notice the world around him; it is in this idea that one may pose the question of whether he chooses to remain oblivious, or simply is oblivious to certain truths about his 'perfect' relationship. The young man is constantly struggling to please her, all with the hopes that she will stay with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432242</url></doc>
