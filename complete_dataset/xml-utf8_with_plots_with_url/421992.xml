<plot>The picture is taken from the front platform of a special car of the noted Great Gorge Railroad. Beginning at Queenstown on the Canadian shore about five miles below Niagara Falls, a curve is rounded before approaching the wire suspension bridge. The bridge is crossed and the car speed along the American shore overlooking the familiar spot to all Niagara Falls tourists. Numerous cars approach and pass the car on which our camera is placed, making this strip replete with motion from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421992</url></doc>
