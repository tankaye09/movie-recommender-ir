<plot>Using stories from the past and present, "Say it Loud" discusses many of the major issues facing the modern day black athlete, and raises the ultimate question, how far have we come and how far do we have to go before there is equality both on and off the playing field? Whether it's a discussion of the fate of America's pastime within the black community or the evolution of professional golf and the effect Tiger Woods has had on the sport, "Say it Loud" offers the viewer an intimate look at the issues from an unbiased and completely original point of view. "Say it Loud" is an important feature that provokes the viewer to reevaluate their point of view and challenges the conventional wisdom about race in sport.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479388</url></doc>
