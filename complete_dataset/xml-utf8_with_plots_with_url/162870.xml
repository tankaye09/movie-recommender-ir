<plot>Jim and Anne: the perfect couple. Struggling to live on their own, they have been brought closer together in spite of Anne's condemning mother. But something strange happened last night. Now, haphazardly barricaded behind the bedroom door, Anne seems to have an insatiable hunger. Well, they would do anything for each other, wouldn't they? In his attempt to find that special something for his special girl Jim pays a visit to the local butcher shop and a funeral home. But little does he know the real solution to his problems is waiting at his doorstep.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162870</url></doc>
