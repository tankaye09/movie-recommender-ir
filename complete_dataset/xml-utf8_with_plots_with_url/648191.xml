<plot>Once high school sweethearts and happy newlyweds, Zach and Erika now live separate lives in the same house, their only interactions are awkward conversations that show just how little they know about each other now. Zach seems to be OK with their new life - dutifully scribbling notes left on the kitchen counter, falling asleep alone on the couch. Erika is looking for more, and invites another man home when Zach is away, though she has trouble admitting to herself why. His more direct advances show her the attention that she is craving, which emboldens her to return his affections, and even to invite him back. As Zach and Erika each take their own path to save themselves, three static cameras record their movements - as we join in watching a pair of lives at the crossroads.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648191</url></doc>
