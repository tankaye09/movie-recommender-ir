<plot>No Justice, Just Us is a drama about a group of fathers who dress as superheroes and kidnap the son of a government minister in order to highlight the social injustice that divorced fathers experience. The plan goes horribly awry when it is discovered that the boy has died while in their supposed care. They all turn on each other, but through the chaos caused by their guilt, denial and attempts to escape the situation, one at least, as the cops are lining up outside, is driven by his need to be a responsible person.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398179</url></doc>
