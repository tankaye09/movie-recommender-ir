<plot>Attrition, the action or process of gradually reducing the strength or effectiveness of someone or something through sustained attack or pressure. Attrition is a different kind of experimental documentary, perhaps one of the simplest forms and therefore one that has become lost in the eyes of the mass media. It's a film that is in the true sense, a pure document, a visual recording of the life of one being during the period of a year. With no speech, the viewer is left to truly engage with this human interest. Attrition is a film that captures time itself. A collection of thousands of photographs taken each day in 2005, the result is a breathtaking, high speed journey of frailty and emotion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?050622</url></doc>
