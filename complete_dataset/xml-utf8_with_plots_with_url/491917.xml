<plot>Dinesh Prakash and Manisha have known each other since their college days. They were attracted to each other, and decided to get married. Dinesh is now employed as an Executive Director in an organization, and makes enough money to live comfortably. Manisha is a housewife. Manisha is a Gemini born on the 10th of June, while Dinesh is a Sagittarius born on the 15th of December. Both Dinesh and Manisha decide to celebrate Dinesh's birthday by inviting several friends over for dinner in their house. The party is on, the guests start arriving, and the only one absent is Dinesh, the birthday boy himself, who is in prison, as he has been arrested by the police on a charge of attempted rape, filed by a female fellow-employee of Dinesh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491917</url></doc>
