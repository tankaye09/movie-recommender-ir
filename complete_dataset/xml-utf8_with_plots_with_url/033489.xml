<plot>Life in a South African Township is seen through the eyes of seven pupils as they come together under the parental eye of Mr Mtshali, headmaster of Velabahleke High School Velabahleke (Come with a Smile) may be the only school in the country that starts at 06h30am and where students are racing to get there on time. Mtshali has created an oasis of excellence for hundreds of learners, where students, staff and the community are doggedly determined that they not" be slaves to their backgrounds". The aspirations and everyday lives of the pupils, both in and out of school, interweave to form a story of a generation striving to transcend their backgrounds and achieve what could now be theirs in the new South Africa</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033489</url></doc>
