<plot>Air Force Second Lieutenant Stromboli must battle through a day's worth of politics, government bureaucracy, and his self-serving boss, Major Meyer, all the while hoping to leave work on time to catch his airplane flight that will take him home to visit his family for the first time in a year. After a typical worthless meeting concludes, Stromboli soon discovers that the General, who wasn't expected until next week, is now on his way. Our hero now has to rush to get a color print of Meyer's presentation, for the General has to have all of his presentations in color. Unfortunately, one of the color printers isn't working, and the other is currently printing the "Complete and Unabridged Works of William Shakespeare". Can our hero successfully navigate through the red-tape and still get to the airport on time?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013064</url></doc>
