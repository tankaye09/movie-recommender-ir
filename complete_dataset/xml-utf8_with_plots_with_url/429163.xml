<plot>Eager to impress his new girlfriend Lisa, Nav steals a caravan and swings by her house to take her away for a weekend. Lisa insists that they take her young daughter Molly along with them. Nav relents but his aim is the same as before - to be with Lisa and not with her daughter. Giving her a tenner and letting her walk off by herself while he beds down in the caravan. Once he has had his fill though, Molly is nowhere to be found.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429163</url></doc>
