<plot>The students at England's only free school, Summerhill, legislate their own laws, manage their own bank, and are free to go to class or not. So when the British government threatens to shut their school down, the students defend their institution, going up against no less than Parliament in the process. The results, not only clear their school, but is a dramatic demonstration of just how affective their school really is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260688</url></doc>
