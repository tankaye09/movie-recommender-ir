<plot>Every family has an inspiring artist, or in their minds nuisance. 'Dinner Time Pest' is an experimental short that distorts the view of a modern kitchen during the preparation of dinner. Mom just doesn't understand why her son has the urge to film her cooking. It's a blend of experimental effects and unique camera angles all set to the natural sounds of the kitchen. The film is an escape from the frustrations of the filmmaking process. Sometimes you just have to pick up a camera and play around with it until you get the right inspiration.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150673</url></doc>
