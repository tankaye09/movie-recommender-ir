<plot>Differently shaped forms fall down into a 2D container. The forms, which can be moved and rotated, must be sorted in "on-the-fly" on the bottom of the container. Every horizontal line completely built without any space makes you score and disappears. Every once in a while the game fastens. Additional points are given if you don't wait for a form to arrive at the bottom and drop it fast. The game ends if there is no room left in the container.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536666</url></doc>
