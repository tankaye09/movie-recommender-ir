<plot>This is good. Pat comes home at night from his day's toil and deliberately disturbs the baby, Dinnis, who is soundly sleeping in his cradle. He fondles and caresses him for a while until Dinnis, by an act of nature, places his papa in an unpleasant situation. Pat's facial expression is very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037533</url></doc>
