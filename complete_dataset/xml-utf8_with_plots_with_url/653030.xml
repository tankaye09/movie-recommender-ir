<plot>Irresponsible... Distant... Self-serving... These are the snapshots that describe John Redgrave. But that's before his wife dies and leaves him alone to raise their three-year-old daughter. Emotionally devastated, John attempts to pick up the pieces of his shattered life as his overzealous father rushes him to find a mother for his little girl. He could fall for Annelise Machiavelli, the aspiring artist he's hired as a baby-sitter, but his lingering grief continues to make him hesitant and uncertain about committing to a new relationship. Though Annelise stands ready to teach him that even tragedy can open the door to new opportunity, self-doubt, selfish ambition, and a crazy potential mother-in-law always seem to get in the way. Grief may conquer him... Fear may ruin him... But everything changes... When Love Walks In.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653030</url></doc>
