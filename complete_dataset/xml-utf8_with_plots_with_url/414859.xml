<plot>Education is the key that unlocks the chains of poverty. Millions of children in India are unable to grasp this key despite a plethora of government programs and promises. In this short documentary, the filmmaker followed a group of children through a typical day in their government school in Bangalore, India. Although this city is the technology capital of India, it is still plagued with problems in its primary education system. Despite a lack of resources, the children show a refreshing eagerness to learn and work hard to succeed at their school. For some students, their only meal is the one served at school, while for others, a single pencil must be shared between 3 siblings. Enrollment lists report 80 students, but many days a real headcount only reaches 28. Those 28 include everyone from 3-year old Manu who follows his sister to school every day, to 13 year old Anjuma who remains in 7th grade because her parents cannot afford to send her to high school. Each child's story could be a film on it's own. By putting a face to the statistics that are discussed in classrooms across campus, the filmmaker hopes to bring greater attention to the problem of access to educational resources in developing countries.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?414859</url></doc>
