<plot>In 1998 pinball was dying, thanks to a saturated market and shrinking player base. Williams, the world's largest pinball manufacturer, planned to abandon the game in favor of the more lucrative video slot machine business. 'The Future of Pinball' is a 60-minute documentary that tells the story of 'Pinball 2000,' a clever attempt at resuscitating pinball that failed just at the moment a lot of people thought it might succeed. A 'Soul of a New Machine' for the pinball world, 'The Future of Pinball' is a compendium of interviews with legends of the pinball industry, photos, and films of the best games the industry has produced. It's a story about personality and passion, of bold success dizzyingly followed by a stunning failure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559539</url></doc>
