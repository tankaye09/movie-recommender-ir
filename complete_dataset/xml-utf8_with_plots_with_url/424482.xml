<plot>C.A. "Carry All" Roach is a merchant on wheels, selling odds and ends from his coach. When Chet Jarvis buys a trinket and needs change of a $20 bill, Roach gets it from his money belt, which does not go unnoticed by Jarvis. Dick Barstow raises horses for a living, but has to get $1500 to pay off a loan he needed for stock. His good friend, Roach, lends him the money by handing him the money belt in exchange for an IOU. Dick likes Roach's young grandson, Bud, so much, he makes him a partner. Later, Dick finds Roach murdered, the coach overturned, and Bud unconscious. Jarvis, who bought the trinket for Dick's girl Jean Morgan, tries to frame Dick, having also stolen Roach's wallet containing the IOU, and mentioning the money belt Dick has to the sheriff. Dick is arrested for murder because he has the incriminating evidence, but he escapes to try to prove his innocence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424482</url></doc>
