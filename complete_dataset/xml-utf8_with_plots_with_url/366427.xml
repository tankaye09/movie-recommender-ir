<plot>Kaaliya Patil is a laborer in a mill in a small town in India. The region experiences riots and as a result there is considerable violence. The police are summoned and are compelled to open fire in the crowds, resulting in deaths of several people. Amongst the dead are Patil's wife and daughter. Patil's pleas for help are ignored, and he also does not get any justice through the system. Angered, he quits his job and takes to crime, and soon becomes the top lieutenant of a don named Sher Khan. Patil still nurses considerable anger at the police, and he seizes his chance to abduct the Police Commissioner's (Ashraf Khan) only daughter and thus avenge the death of his child and wife. For Sher Khan this is like killing two birds with one stone, as he will not only get his vengeance against Ashraf, but also force him to get his only daughter, Farheen, to marry his brother, Salim. The question is will Ashraf let Patil and Sher Khan to get the upper hand, or does he have a surprise tucked away as his ace against them?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366427</url></doc>
