<plot>"A sailboat is just starting out from the dock with its jolly crowd of young people, and Uncle Reuben with the lunch basket comes running down. The boat is a little too far away from the dock, but he jumps for it and just misses, falling into the water with lunch basket and all. The picnickers pull him out, and scold him for his clumsiness."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248307</url></doc>
