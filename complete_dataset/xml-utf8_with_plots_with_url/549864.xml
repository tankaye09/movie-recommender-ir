<plot>10-year-old Victor discovers brief respites from his abusive world through the love of classical music. As an adult, Victor has continued down the silent path of acceptance of abuses. While he was helpless to do anything about it as a child, Victor has discovered secretive, destructive ways to seize some semblance of control within his own mind. Victor will never conduct a symphony orchestra of the classical music he loves so much, but he is evolving into a deadly orchestrator of the lives of those who touch his world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549864</url></doc>
