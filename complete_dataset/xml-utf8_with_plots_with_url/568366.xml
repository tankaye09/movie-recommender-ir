<plot>Motion picture films of the coronation of King Edward VII, which took place on August 9th, 1902, were ready for delivery from our factory at Orange, N. J., on the 18th the Monday, next following. A cablegram from our special photographers in London on August 9th, 1902, advised us that they had secured the complete pictures on that day, that the pictures were sent to Queenstown, and placed on board the fast steamship "Umbria" of the Cunard Line, Sailing Sunday, August 10th, 1902. Thus we were enabled to receive the coronation films in America at least three days in advance of mail matter which was posted in London on the day of the coronation. Remember we had the exclusive right of kinetographing the ceremonies at Westminister Abbey, and our pictures were not only the first to arrive in America, but they were the only authentic views. An excellent picture, in which the State Coach containing the King and Queen is shown to good advantage, together with all the notables.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568366</url></doc>
