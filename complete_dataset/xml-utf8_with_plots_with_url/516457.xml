<plot>Susan, a gold-digging con artist, marries the 108-year-old Edwin on the safe assumption that he'll soon die and she'll be able to grab his fortune. Four years later, however, Edwin is still alive and frisky, and she's beginning to run out of patience. What she doesn't know is that a witch is keeping Edwin alive until he turns 150 in order to complete one of her own magic spells. Will Susan (along with her lover, Eric) be able to work out a deal, or will they be stuck waiting on Edwin for the next forty years?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516457</url></doc>
