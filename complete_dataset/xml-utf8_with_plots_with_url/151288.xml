<plot>When Emma Benton-Hughes was left by her husband she had very little money and needed work fast. She became a stripper-gram and then moved into glamour-modelling. Looking to make the most of her work, "Eve" opened her own fan club and was soon swamped with subscriptions and fan mail to the point where she couldn't cope. Hiring her brother and her mother to help her reply to them. The story of this is intercut with her brother's newest job - a comedy show where he reads out the letters to an audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151288</url></doc>
