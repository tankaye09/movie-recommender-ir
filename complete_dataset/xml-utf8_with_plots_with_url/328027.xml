<plot>Davey and Max have pulled off a job behind Walter Marconi's back. They thought they got away with "murder". But when the guy they had to kill turns out to be the right hand man of the "Guy from Chi-town", and Walter finds out, they have no choice but to leave town. Journey through the night with Davey and Loose Cannon Larry, a psychotic killer with no conscience, as Davey kills his own associates for their money, so that he and his family can survive on the run for the rest of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328027</url></doc>
