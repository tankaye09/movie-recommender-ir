<plot>It is train time. We look down the long platform, crowded with people, and see the famous N.P. Railway Overland Express approaching rapidly. In a moment the engine passes by, slowing down. Then comes one, two, three, four express cars, and behind them seven coaches and Pullmans. Passengers alight, baggage is unloaded, friends greet each other, station men rush here and there, the whole scene being one of great interest and activity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418968</url></doc>
