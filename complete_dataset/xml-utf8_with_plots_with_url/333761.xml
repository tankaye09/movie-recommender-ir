<plot>Long after two women have left religious life, a surprise letter from one awakens in the other memories of events that led to the end of their friendship. During the turbulent times of Vatican II, Sister Claire and Sister Francis, talented teaching nuns who feel stifled and undervalued, seek the intelligent and sympathetic company of their priest, confessor and advisor, Father Tremblay. Claire is devastated by the priest's all too human machinations. Francis succumbs and becomes his lover. When Francis, smitten, confides in her by means of a clandestine telephone call, Claire is so deeply disturbed that she responds with little more than a word of caution. Twelve years later, Francis contacts Claire again. She writes that she continues to enjoy the company of the Father, as his time and duties permit. Claire discovers that potent feelings of loss and betrayal linger in the memories of her younger days.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333761</url></doc>
