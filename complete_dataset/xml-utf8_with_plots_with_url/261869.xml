<plot>In one of the most remote corners of indigenous Australia, a small community is fighting for its traditions and its future. Looking to the nearby mining towns and mission settlements the community Elders can see their culture in decline and abuse. They are worried that families' may be forced by Government to leave the safety of their ancestral lands, and accept a future without the foundations of their culture. This is the intimate story of one families' struggle to cope with the responsibilities of a richly complex traditional culture in a fast consuming 21st Century world. And their challenge: how do you raise kids with the dignity, insight, and self-respect necessary to succeed in these conflicting worlds?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261869</url></doc>
