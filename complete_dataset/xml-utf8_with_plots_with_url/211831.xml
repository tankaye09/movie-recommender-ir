<plot>There is one voice, living on and for the stage; a voice that captured the opera theaters all over the world. The musical documentary portraits Gena Dimitrova as a woman and creator. The camera follows the opera prima during her dynamic days, peeps into her dressing room, and conveys the spell of the stage. It looks behind the disguise of this genius of a performer and makes a way for the spectators towards the person, towards the views of life of a woman whom the opera turned into a honorable citizen of the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?211831</url></doc>
