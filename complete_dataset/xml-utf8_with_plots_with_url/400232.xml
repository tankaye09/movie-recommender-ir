<plot>Antoine Laurentz, a French teacher at a college in the provinces, has led a withdrawn existence in his little old house ever since his wife's death in an accident. One day he is visited by the impoverished-looking Louis Lambert and his 13-year-old daughter Nora. Antoine had allowed Louis, who is unemployed because of alcohol problems, to live in his wife's former surgery, but is now having to sell it because of financial problems. The distraught Louis begs Antoine not to make him live out in the streets, but Antoine sends the two of them away. Outside the house Louis shoots himself in front of his daughter -- who will now have to spend the rest of her life in a state orphanage. Antoine feels deeply responsible for this tragic turn of events. He wants to be Nora's guardian, and offers her a secure, middle-class existence. Charlotte, a friend of Antoine's who at first was absolutely against his decision to make Nora his ward, is attracted by the impetuous girl, and soon becomes a loving mother figure to her as well as an understanding friend. Under Charlotte's protection and Antoine's care, Nora soon develops into an elegant young lady. At the age of 16, however, Nora starts to question her new life. Her yearning for freedom sends her straight into the arms of Stéph, an old friend from her youth, and Antoine's reaction is one of extreme jealousy. He senses that his paternal feelings are threatening to be replaced by love. When Nora realizes this she feels betrayed, and moves out of the house. She goes to live with her friend Stéph and stops going to school. Antoine struggles with himself, and finally decides to hide his feelings for Nora in future. Nora gradually realizes that Antoine, not Stéph, is the man she truly loves. She returns to Antoine for a single night of passion -- but knows that she has to find her own path in life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400232</url></doc>
