That they call for more than his demise. They call for his fall into an oblivion of insanity forever. Resisting through childhood and adolescence he has been committed through out. Finally fooling his captors into thinking that all has become well for him. In his last attempt for freedom he is visited by a dark demon who seduces Mark's pain and sorrow to his final and eternal undoing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062649</url></doc>
