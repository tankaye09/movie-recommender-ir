<plot>Arif Hossein is a 13-year-old boy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose father is a poor rickshaw driver. In order to make ends meet, Arif works eight to 10 hours a day decorating rickshaws to make extra money, even though the law forbids children younger than 14 to work. However, unlike most other Bangladeshi children, Arif not only manages to attend school for a few hours a day, but he is also a reporter on childrens issues for a local TV station. The film follows him as he reports from different areas of the city, interviewing working children, the bosses who employ them and various adults and organizations fighting to stop illegal child labor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045297</url></doc>
