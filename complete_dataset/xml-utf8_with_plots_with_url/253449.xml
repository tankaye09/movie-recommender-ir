<plot>"I Won't Drown..." chronicles the failed evacuation of the Orleans Parish Prison during Hurricane Katrina and the building of a makeshift prison behind the local bus depot. Set within the larger abandonment, criminalization and violence that characterized the state's response, it also provokes a larger understanding of the hurricane as a "man-made disaster," where lines of race and class were drawn out in the decisions of saving property versus lives, of who was recognized as a "survivor" and who as a "looter," who was saved and who was left to drown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253449</url></doc>
