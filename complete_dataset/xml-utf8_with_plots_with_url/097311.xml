<plot>Two hundred thousand years ago, teenage girls wanted the same as teenage girls do today, teenage boys! However one amongst them shunned such basic instincts. She wasn't into teenage clubs, teenage music, teenage fashions. She had more important things on her mind. She had battles to fight, wars to win, evil to conquer. She's young, she's fierce. And it's a shame she doesn't care about fashion 'cause she's got great legs. She's Cavegirl. The new teen movie adapted from hit BBC television series.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097311</url></doc>
