<plot>A witty young woman, Samantha Billows, is clearly the sharpest tool in the box except for one minor detail, she has a foot-in-mouth syndrome. Clinically, Samantha is diagnosed with a bizarre social anxiety disorder. How she will ever put her unique whipper-snapper, slogan creating skills to good use in the advertising world is beyond her wildest dreams. No therapist seems to help her move beyond her plant maintenance job. But then a miracle happens, she discovers the extraordinarily addictive power of blogging! By typing away hours of anxiety, she begins to gain control of her life and her brilliance breaks through. Her new found courage helps her obtain the job of her dreams as a Junior Copywriter on a temporary basis. Just when life couldn't get better, she falls hard for a client, French VP of PR, Desmond. Although opposites, the two become closer as strange secrets seem to spill from Desmond's lips. And as long as Samantha keeps blogging, her career and love life blossom; until her blog is discovered by an evil co-worker. Unbeknown to her, the blog becomes an underground smash hit with her entire office! They perform stupid, lewd and crazy acts to get Samantha to enter them into her blog so they can have their 15 minutes of Internet fame. As her private blog becomes fodder for others' amusement, Samantha finally learns the awful truth about the blog's ridiculous popularity. Will she be able to stop her blog before her new found love finds out? Or will it destroy her and everyone around her...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133722</url></doc>
