<plot>The Katrina animal rescue was a hard and emotional experience for all the people who were involved in it. Unlike the happy reality portrayed by large welfare organizations, the day-to-day reality was gruesome and deeply disturbing. Companion animals were left behind in New Orleans, dying of dehydration and starvation because the local animal organization in New Orleans (LASPCA) did not have a plan of action to go out and save people's pets in New Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parish. Katrina has exposed the dire conditions of animal welfare in Mississippi as well with the animal shelter in Waveland, which clearly contrasts with well-run shelters in Gulfport and Tylertown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040833</url></doc>
