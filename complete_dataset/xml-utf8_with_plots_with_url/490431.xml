<plot>Kiu and three men. Kiu is a fisherman's daughter in a village. Her father is aging, so they hire Wah at their small store. He's new to the village. Next to the store is a restaurant owned by Chuen Wong, probably a small-time thug and boss, always smiling, joking, and pestering Kiu. A friend stays with him in the village while doing research: he's Man, a university student. One day, as yet unmarried and innocent, Kiu sees her friend Kim making love on a boat to a boyfriend. Kiu and these three men - Wah, Wong, and Man - plus Kim and her boyfriend create a storm of passion, violence, jealousy, and fateful consequences around sex, social status, and gender roles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490431</url></doc>
