<plot>Fernando, the owner of an old neighborly restaurant in a poor area of Buenos Aires, organizes a tango singing contest for amateurs. For the first round, contestants have to sing 'for their special someone'. The second premise is 'the saddest tango', and for the final, contestants will have to sing the tango that has touched them the most, 'the tango of my life'. It is casting time. It is a rainy night; expectation and nervousness run in the air. Sixty people auditioned, but only eighteen were selected, among whom we find a grandmother, a teenager, a housewife, a lawyer, an astrologer, a chicken merchant and a school teacher. As long as the contest advances, we will share, along with the contestants and the jury, the rehearsals, the thrill in every round, their daily lives, the difficulties they encounter when singing, the history behind some popular tangos, the secrets in the execution of different instruments and some rather bizarre characters who, day by day at the office, in their homes, with their family and friends, feel the beat of the 2 x 4.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?173970</url></doc>
