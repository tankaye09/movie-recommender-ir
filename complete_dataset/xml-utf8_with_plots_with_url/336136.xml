<plot>A series of murders takes place in the Metropolis in a span of three weeks, the latest of which happens on the night Junior, a taxi driver, makes love to a prostitute. After establishing a pattern from the killings, Inspector Noble, the police investigator, will theorize that only one person, a serial or thrill killer, maybe responsible for all of the murders. Junior is aware of the killings but it doesn't seem to bother him, unlike most ordinary people who have heard of the news about a serial killer roaming the city. Together with Trixie's friend Toti, Junior and Trixie head to the countryside where Trixie's family live. Junior gets to meet Martha, Trixie's weird mother, a tough lady with a shotgun always on her side. Junior also gets to know Max, Trixie's weird brother, a war-scarred former Marine soldier who's got traces of insanity. Martha's rejection of Junior is evident from the start. Martha wants Trixie to end the relationship, and immediately tell Junior that he is not welcome in the family. At this time, a mysterious man riding in an old van is heading towards Trixie's house. The bulky, ominous looking man with murderous eyes eventually reaches the house, and once inside, takes down Trixie's family one by one. First to fall is Max's wife, then the house helper, Max, and finally Martha. The man takes the shocked and hysterical Trixie alive. Junior on the other hand, manages to hide and elude the man. Meanwhile, Inspector Noble finally identifies the serial killer after getting a lead from the remains of a murdered woman. He is Damian Garote, an officer of Metrocom during Martial Law. He was considered to be the most brutal and ruthless police officer during his time. After he retired from the service, no one knew where he went. Junior eventually gets in the way of Damian, and tries to stop the man from getting away with Trixie. The two men get to see each other eye to eye after they got out of the van which rammed to a tree. The two will recognize each other easily. But in the end, nothing is what it seems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336136</url></doc>
