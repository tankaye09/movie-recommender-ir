<plot>Justin, a student at USC with his video camera rolling, knocks on the door of male prostitute, Bobby Starr. Bobby has agreed to give Justin an interview, as long as it's just for a class project: his family thinks he's a person trainer. As Justin keeps his focus on Bobby and asks a few questions, Bobby gets ready for his next house call and talks non-stop. He explains that he's not a hustler, he's a gigolo. He describes clients' bizarre requests: the wealthier the client, the weirder the request. He puts on make up; he's philosophical. He's putting on a Sid Vicious look, taking on a more aggressive personality. He makes Justin an offer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077370</url></doc>
