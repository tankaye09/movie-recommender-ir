<plot>Filmed in super 16mm widescreen format JAMES HERRIOT'S YORKSHIRE features the breathtaking scenery of Wensleydale, Swaledale, Coverdale, Thirsk, Sutton Bank, Captain Cook country, Scarborough, Robin Hood's Bay, York and Harrogate as well as featuring the people and animals so often associated with Herriot's novels. " Over the years I have received literally thousands of letters from readers of my books from all over the world. The same phrase has recurred; I wish I could see the places you write about - if this film can reach those people then it will give them a glimpse of the countryside where I have found so many of the good things of life. The scenes and photography are exquisite and Chris's commentary and appearance superb. The film was a constant joy to watch</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273358</url></doc>
