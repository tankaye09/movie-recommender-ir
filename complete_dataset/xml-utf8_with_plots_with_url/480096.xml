<plot>From Colorado Springs to Cripple Creek, a distance of only forty miles, there is a railroad whose scenic value has been pronounced by globe trotters to be superior to any other road in the world, not even excepting those of Switzerland. The greatest obstacles in engineering have been encountered, for the road goes boldly over the backbone of the Rocky Mountains at one of its most beautiful points. Other roads have wound their way through canyons and valleys, but this one alone has gone over them, thus looking down on the views the other roads are accustomed to look up at. While climbing up the 11,000 feet to Cripple Creek, many vistas are formed with rock and trees in the foreground and the plains in the distance, stretching out as far as the eye can see. Such views, with the aid of beautiful clouds, form the first section of the film. Cripple Creek, the greatest gold mining camp in the world, then appears. It is situated in a valley, and as the train passes over it, a bird's eye view of the whole town and its environments is obtained. A panoramic picture, taken at this point from the baggage car while the train was rounding a curve, gives a very pleasing effect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?480096</url></doc>
