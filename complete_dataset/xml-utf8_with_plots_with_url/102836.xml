<plot>Dale Chihuly and his crew are filmed as they go to the Iittala Glass Factory in Nuutaj√§rvi, Finland, the Waterford Crystal Factory in Ireland, the Vitro Crisa Factory in Monterrey, Mexico, and to Venice Italy in order to create a collection of handblown work from various artists around the world. The final masterpieces are eventually put together around Venice, with a grand sculpture on display at a show in the Doges Palace in Venice. This documentary shows the hard work and sometimes guerilla style of Chihuly's vision. The masters of glass blowing collaborate in awe with each other, and Chihuly's own respected team from the Boathouse Studio in Seattle, Washington. Michael W. Barnard took on much of the documentary duties, getting into the action of the pressure and sweat labor put into making the greatest pieces of modern art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102836</url></doc>
