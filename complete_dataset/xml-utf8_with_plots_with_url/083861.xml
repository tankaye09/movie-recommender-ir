<plot>Three best friends struggling to deal with the dynamics of change that occur as they enter adult life. Johnny, an aspiring filmmaker, is trying to complete his documentary film when he finds out that his best friend, Ryan, has asked his other best friend, Elisabeth, to marry him. Since Elisabeth hasn't given Ryan an answer yet, Johnny hopes he might have a chance to be more than friends with Elisabeth. Johnny turns to prescription pills to give him "three more hours a day" as he balances his day job - security guard - with his dream job - filmmaker - and his pursuit of Elisabeth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083861</url></doc>
