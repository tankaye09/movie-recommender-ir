<plot>Mahesh (Sanjeev Kumar) has returned home from overseas to his home country, India, alongwith the girl he plans to marry, Seema (Shabana Azmi). He is greeted at the airport by his dad's assistant, Mack (Satyen Kappu), and subsequently by his dad (also Sanjeev Kumar). His dad and mom, Saroj (Dina Pathak) welcome their son home, and approve of his girlfriend, and look forward to marrying the two of them. But Seema wants her future husband not to be dependent on his wealthy father, but instead but a living for himself, to which Mahesh agrees. When he starts to look for a job, he is at first amazed and then astounded as to his father's popularity. And then someone named Uday (Kabir Bedi) tells Mahesh the truth about his father. What is the truth, and what are the consequences of this knowledge?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641711</url></doc>
