<plot>The scene is laid in front of a Baxter street clothing store. The proprietor has just succeeded in dragging a man into his place to sell him some clothing, when a tramp strolls along. The man comes out of the store highly indignant, and seizing a suit which hangs on a peg outside the store throws it at the tramp.
