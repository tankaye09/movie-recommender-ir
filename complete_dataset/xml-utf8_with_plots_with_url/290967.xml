<plot>Wally Walrus is the conductor at a local schoolhouse who conducts the entire school band to the tune of "Morning, Noon, and Night in Vienna". Among the gags set to music: A skunk is forced to play his instrument outside, a caterpillar resting on a guitar is pursued by the rooster playing it, and one boy uses his knitting needles to play the drums (when he plays a rather long piece, he knits two pairs of socks!). The piece ends when Wally becomes entangled with bubble gum that one boy has been blowing through his trumpet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290967</url></doc>
