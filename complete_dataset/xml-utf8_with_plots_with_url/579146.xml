<plot>An updated version of the long-running game show, now with host Paul Rodriguez. Newlywed husbands and wives would take turns answering (often risque) questions while their spouses were backstage. After answering, the spouses would return and be asked the same questions, earning points if their answers matched their spouse's. The couple that finished with the most points would win a prize.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579146</url></doc>
