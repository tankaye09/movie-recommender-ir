<plot>We've all heard that laughter is the best medicine, and though we don't recommend you try to bottle it, a daily dose can be a surprisingly effective supplement to a person's physical, mental and social well-being, with no harmful side effects. Laughter has the physiological benefits that counter the harmful effects of stress in the body, as well as improving a person's quality of life. Whether it is laughing at a joke, or attending a laughter club, people are laughing for their health, and laughing for laughter's sake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321299</url></doc>
