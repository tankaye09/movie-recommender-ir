<plot>Brandi and Denise arrive at work and discover that their employer has been burglarized. Realizing that they forgot to turn on the burglar alarm as they've been warned to do time and again, the lovely ladies decide to tie themselves up and pretend that a masked intruder captured them, bound them and then robbed the shop. It's only after they tie themselves up so securely that they can't possibly escape do they realize that it's a holiday weekend and no one will check on their whereabouts for days. Fortunately (or unfortunately, as the case may be) for the damsels in distress, a crook on the lam decides to use the office as a hideout and, to entertain himself, places the ladies in tighter and tighter bondage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?631266</url></doc>
