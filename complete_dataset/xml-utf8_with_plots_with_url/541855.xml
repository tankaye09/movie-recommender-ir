<plot>This is the story of Josie7, a rockband made up of 4 young men, who are plucked from the relative obscurity of playing local pubs entertaining uni students (and young ladies) and thrust into a 3 month tour where they'll be treated like cleaners, rock Gods and ultimately TV stars. The boys grow as a band and as friends throughout the course of their tour and the experiences they share. From camel wrestling to the famous minmin light and outback phantoms the adventures are endless, all the while the cinematography of outback QLD providing a fitting backdrop to the original score of Josie7's music. Will the boys survive in 1 piece and return to their loved ones and will the $5000 touring wagon fall apart before they do?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541855</url></doc>
