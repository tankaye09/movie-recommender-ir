<plot>When Mark hears the urban myth about the dietary habits of the new kid in school, the last thing he wants is to be invited round to dinner. His worst fears are realised when he has to endure a three-course meal at the Campbell family residence. Mark cannot decide what's worse, not knowing what's in the soup, or worrying that he could be the next course. Meat The Campbells is a dark, humorous and gruesome tale in which an invitation to dinner has never been so deadly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363106</url></doc>
