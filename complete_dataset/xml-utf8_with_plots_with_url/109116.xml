<plot>Mark Abele is a young man who seems to be making a go of his life. He has kicked his drug habit, he is a staff member at Daytop Village, and is married to a beautiful woman. But like the Magellanic Clouds being sucked in by the Milky Way, he is being engulfed by the forces that nearly destroyed him, and is losing touch with his goals. Revisiting his past through numerous flashbacks, he finds the key that might help him to unlock the path to a more stable, brighter future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109116</url></doc>
