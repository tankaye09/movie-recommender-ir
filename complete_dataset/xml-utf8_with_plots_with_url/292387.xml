<plot>This splendid film opens with a magnificent panorama of the most powerful fleet of fighting ships ever assembled. Just after the commencement of the film, as the camera swings round, the long lines of battleships come into view, all their guns spurting smoke as they fire the Royal salute. This makes a picturesque and extremely beautiful scene, as the ships are wreathed in flame from the discharging guns, and thousands of flags with which all the ships are decorated flutter in the wind. A large number of private yachts and crowded pleasure boats are next seen, the film winding up with splendid views of the Royal Yacht, with the King on board. A very pretty and beautiful picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292387</url></doc>
