<plot>A stout German musician is seen to come down a lane, and stop under the window of a house in the foreground. As he starts to play his instrument the window is raised, and a pretty young lady appears. The musician makes love to her, and finally succeeds in getting a kiss. As the couple are busy making love, the young lady's father appears. He sees a pitcher of water standing near, and empties its contents into the instrument which the musician has set on end against the house. The old man steps around the side of the house to await developments. Soon the musician is coaxed by the young lady to play another tune for her. He picks up his instrument and blows in it with all his might, just as it is directly under the lady's face. She gets a soaking and becomes enraged at the joke which she thinks her lover played on her. She retaliates by throwing a large bowl of water over him. At this point the old man takes a hand, and a lively scuffle ensues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?486632</url></doc>
