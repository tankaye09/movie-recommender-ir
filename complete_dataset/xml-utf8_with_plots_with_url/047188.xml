<plot>Students from Webster Groves High School in Missouri illustrate how to learn good manners so that when a big event, like a school dance, comes along, you won't be so unsure of yourself that you fail to have a good time. The voice-over narration illustrates good behavior, learned from an early age. Students practice their social graces every day in many locations: the school hallway between classes, the cafeteria during lunch, at home, and at nice restaurants. Good manners, intones the narrator, are based on consideration of others in little as well as big things. Practice every day and by the time that big dance comes along, you'll know how to enjoy yourself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047188</url></doc>
