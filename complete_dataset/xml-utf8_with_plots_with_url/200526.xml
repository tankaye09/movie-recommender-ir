<plot>Maggie Taheri and her two sons, Ali and Shawn, have just arrived in Canada from Iran. Maggie is forced to take a job as a dishwasher while the older son, Ali, winds up mopping floors in a local hockey arena. For Ali, these hard times call for conservatism and determination, but Maggie doesn't seem to share the same sensibilities. Preferring to spend her money on gifts for her sons, rather than filling the fridge, Maggie causes Ali to doubt her parenting skills. When Ali gets arrested for shoplifting, he is forced to reconsider his way of thinking and he soon comes to realize that sometimes it might be better for the stomach to starve, in order to keep the spirit alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200526</url></doc>
