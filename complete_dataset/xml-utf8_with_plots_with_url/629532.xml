<plot>A young lady is admiring a number of Christmas presents on a table. Her beau enters. After embracing her, he gives her a present. Her mother and father enter, carrying a step-ladder. After greeting the young man, they proceed to fasten a piece of mistletoe to the chandelier. The young man insists on doing it, although his sweetheart tries to dissuade. He lets the step-ladder fall, breaking a bust upon a pedestal. After considerable trouble he finally gets the ladder in position and climbs up very timidly. While reaching over to tie the mistletoe the ladder falls, leaving him hanging to the chandelier. His dangling feet smash the Christmas gifts on the table, the chandelier gives way, and he falls and breaks the table and lands in a heap on the floor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629532</url></doc>
