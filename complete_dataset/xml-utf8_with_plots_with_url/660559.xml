<plot>Woody Herman and his big band play on a stage in front of a theater audience. Herman leads the band, sings, and takes a few clarinet solos. Herman and the band do "Carolina in the Morning," "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby," and "Doctor Jazz." Between the songs are two dance numbers. In the first, "Two Little Girls in One," Lee Wiley and Marie Hartman, looking like twins, dance as if they are one dancer and her mirrored reflection. In the second, "Jail House Blues," Hal and Honey Abbott tap to a fast beat, doing a version of the Lindy that morphs into more comic turns. The audience applauds each number.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660559</url></doc>
