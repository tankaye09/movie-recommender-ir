<plot>Adapted in part from Cole Haddon's "An Unusually Hot Month", An Unusually Hot Summer unfolds across three short vignettes. Kate, 13, is lost in her new suburban neighborhood and seeks help from Allyson, a sunbathing teenage bombshell. David, 13, watches older teenager Chris repair a car, and Chris asks for David's help. In both cases, these interactions are merely backdrops to deeper lessons the young teens learn about themselves as adolescence emerges. The final vignette finds our two young protagonists on the first day of school, testing what they've learned during the unusually hot summer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037559</url></doc>
