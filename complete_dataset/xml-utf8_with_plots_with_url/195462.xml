<plot>Fire Creek tells the story of a young soldier's search for an answer to the age-old question "why do bad things happen to good people?" Jason is serving as a soldier in Afghanistan when divine intervention saves him from a sniper attack. However, his closest friend, a devoted husband and father, is shot and killed just inches away. Critically wounded but alive, Jason returns home wondering why his life was spared. The rest of the film follows his search for answers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195462</url></doc>
