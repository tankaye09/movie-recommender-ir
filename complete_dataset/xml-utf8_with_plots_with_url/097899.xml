<plot>Sam (21) returns to her father's orchard after his death. However, rather than the peace she hoped for, she encounters evidence that her father may have been tracking some creature in the woods. She wakes in the woods the next morning, lost, and alone. Returning home on foot, she finds that there's no power, her cell phone is dead, and her car won't start. As her fear mounts, she finds an injured man by the cellar. Taking him in, she tries to help him. He remains unconscious, however. Picturing her deceased father, she seeks his help, finding only that she must face up to her problems on her own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097899</url></doc>
