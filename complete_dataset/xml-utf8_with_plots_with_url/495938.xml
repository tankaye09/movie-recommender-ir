<plot>Jodi disapproves of older sister Andrea's job and boyfriend. When Andrea announces that she's going out on another date with the sleaze-ball, Jodi can't stand it anymore - she grabs the leggy brunette, drags her into the bedroom and leaves her on the floor securely roped and silenced. When the jerk comes to pick Andrea up, Jodi announces that her sister had better things to do. When Jodi releases her sister, Andrea curtly announces that her "boyfriend" was the object of a undercover investigation and that Andrea was working for the district attorney's office. Before Andrea can leave the apartment to search for the scumbag, a bunch of thugs break-in and grab the comely lasses. They soon realize that Andrea is really and undercover cop and both girls' lives are now in deadly peril.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?495938</url></doc>
