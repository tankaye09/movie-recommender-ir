<plot>The movie is about Joe, a Malaysian studying in UK. He had been running a pirated CD business on the side by selling Malaysian pirated CDs in UK. Because of his habit to procrastinate, he only decided to buy his supply on the day before he was suppose to return to UK. It so happens that the police decide to hold a major operation to get rid of these CDs on that same day. Finding himself unable to obtain any more CDs he strives, with comical results, to find enough supply before the day is up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106818</url></doc>
