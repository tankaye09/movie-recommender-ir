<plot>Behind every great action heroes, there are real life heroes. Superman's acts of bravery are well-documented, but few have heard of the historians, actors, animated artists, and "SuperFans" that turned this flying man of steel into one of the world's greatest comic book heroes. In a Single Bound takes us from the inception of Superman by his creators Siegel and Shuster to his explosion into comic books, film, and even the courtroom. This explosive documentary is sure to fascinate anyone who has ever wondered what heroes are made of.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262536</url></doc>
