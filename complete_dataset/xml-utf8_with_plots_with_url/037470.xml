<plot>The Pink Panther encounters a coin-operated talking weight and fortune machine which suggests that he bring it home with him on the basis of it being a valuable asset, able to provide weather forecasts and sports scores and predict the future whenever the panther so-desires. The Pink Panther assents to the machine's proposal, but whenever the machine is on the verge of disclosing expected important information, it goes silent, requiring the panther to insert a dime in the machine's coin slot. Besides, the information is not helpful in improving the panther's condition as a safe falls on top of the Pink Panther after the machine foresees a fortune "com(ing his) way", "back payment from a rear" is really a painful impact onto him from behind by a speeding car, and the panther refuses to believe the machine's statement that his future is "in the bag", the result being instant wealth for a man who picks up from a street a sack of money that the Pink Panther would have owned had he heeded the machine's prescience. The rope with which the Pink Panther pulls the machine up a hill breaks, and the machine rolls down the hill and off of a city pier. The Pink Panther declines to save it from drowning, instead dropping an anvil onto it to hasten its submergence into the water.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037470</url></doc>
