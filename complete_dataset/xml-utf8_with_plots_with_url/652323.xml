<plot>WHAT'S UP IN FINANCE?, a half-hour reality show hosted by Kwame Jackson (from season one of The Apprentice), features teens and twenty-somethings using their money smarts -- and the help of finance professionals -- to work toward financial independence. In segment one, "Moving Out," Eddie Romero, a junior college student and aspiring musician, figures out how to plan for his financial future after moving into his own apartment. "Green Chic" showcases up-and-coming fashion designer Anna Cohen of Portland, Oregon, and her efforts to keep her start-up company -- and her dream of ecologically-friendly fashion -- afloat financially. "The Dealmakers" follows two teams of students from Nashville, Tennessee, as they compete in a simulation of a multi-billion dollar business deal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652323</url></doc>
