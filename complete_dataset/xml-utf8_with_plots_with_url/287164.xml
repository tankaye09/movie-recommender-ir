<plot>A film portrait about the moving life of German painter Karl Weschke. Born in Gera he grew up as the son of a prostitute and as a streetkid always dreamed of being a hero. Hitler seemed to be that hero, but then he was taken to England as a prisoner of war and received education in a British re-education camp. Today in the UK he is a well-known painter, with eight paintings in the permanent collection of the Tate Gallery. It took him to become 70 to realize a lifelong dream: Egypt, the cradle of mankind for him. The film follows Karl Weschke, now being 74. From is home town Gera, to Cornwall and finally to Egypt, which - after having seen it for the first time - enlighted all his paintings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287164</url></doc>
