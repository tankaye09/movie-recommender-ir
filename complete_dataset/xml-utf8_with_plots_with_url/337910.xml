<plot>The second installment of Frank Mosley's Perception Trilogy, inspired by Greek philosopher Plato's quote, "We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light." LITTLE BOY, shot on HD, is a 15 minute short experimental film. It is an examination of responsibility during the creation of the Atomic bomb during 1945. Shot on a soundstage to invoke the sense of theater, it highlights a moment in time where innocence is lost and only uncertainty lies ahead. Michael Morse is an anonymous man working for an anonymous sector of the Manhattan Project when he gets two phone calls in quick succession: that the atomic bomb has been completed and that his wife has just given birth to their son at the local hospital. What happens next is a fusing of past, present, and future, interweaving in the head of a man doomed to be the messenger of destruction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337910</url></doc>
