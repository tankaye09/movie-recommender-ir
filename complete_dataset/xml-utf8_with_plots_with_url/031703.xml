<plot>Deep inside a cave a group of prisoners are chained to a wall since their childhood. Not only are their limbs immobilized by the chains but their heads are also chained so that their eyes are fixed on a wall and can only see the shadows that are projected in front of them. These shadows are what they believe is the truth. Then one of the prisoners escapes the darkness of the cave into the light of a new world and realizes that the truth lies beyond his chains. However, when he returns to the cave to free his peers with his new found truth, the other prisoners refuse to believe him. Filmmaker Fahmi Farahat uses his unique style to create a visual interpretation of Plato's masterpiece and perhaps the best known of work, Allegory of the Cave from his book, The Republic. The DVD includes a special interview with Professor Professor Claiton Kardajan, Prefesor of Philospy at Long Beach City College that further explores the Allegory of the Cave and helps us understand the meaning and importance of this great work by Plato.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031703</url></doc>
