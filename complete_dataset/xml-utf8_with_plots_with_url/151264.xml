<plot>A small dog watches from the street below as an angry woman throws her man's things out the second story window. When she tosses out his guitar, he runs down to the street, takes the guitar out of the case, and starts to play "Greensleeves" to her. Will she come to the window and invite him back? She's cast him off discourteously, but who will delight in his company?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151264</url></doc>
