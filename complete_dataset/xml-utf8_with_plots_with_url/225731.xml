<plot>With a stationary camera placed above eye level looking down a row of at least 20 cadets, with four more rows of young men visible, we watch them do stretching exercises in unison then calisthenics standing in place. They are cadets at the Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. By the end, they are running in place. The water, hills, and a tug or trawler are visible in the background.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225731</url></doc>
