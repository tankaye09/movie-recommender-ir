<plot>Smedley is guarding his master's estate when he receives a package in the mail containing Chilly Willy. Chilly immediately sets his sights on devouring the master's stuffed barracuda which Smedley does everything in his power to prevent. Chilly eventually grinds the marlin into little pieces which Smedley tries to reconstruct before the master returns. While Smedley does succeed in piecing the marlin back together several times, Chilly strikes again until the marlin is once again in pieces and Smedley is forced to takes its place over the fireplace with his master none the wiser.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196269</url></doc>
