<plot>A unfulfilled love story of a prominent lawyer, 'Shiv Shankar' who loses his vision in an accident and is thrown into a life of seclusion. He also loses contact with his beloved (Vijayshanti) a doctor by profession. Shiv starts leading the life of a recluse. Years later, a college girl (Karisma Kapoor) knocks at his door seeking his help to secure justice for her Engineer beau (Arshad Warsi) who is falsely implicated in his own mother's murder case and put behind bars. He first turns her down stating that he had quit practice but later takes up the case as the young lovers reminded him of his amorous youth. In the climax Shiv reveals the truth and makes a key witness confess the truth before the judge. The trial is carried out in public as the case had snowballed into a major public issue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?669099</url></doc>
