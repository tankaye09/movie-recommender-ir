<plot>Two old soldiers, Jeb and Homer, chat about the Civil War. Homer tells his story of being a Kentucky youth, who enlists with the South only to discover that his brother has joined the Blues. He's captured and his brother frees him, then the tide turns and it's Homer who has to rescue his brother. When the North retakes the town, Homer must use all his wits - and a few short logs of wood - to save himself. Have he and Jeb met before?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376502</url></doc>
