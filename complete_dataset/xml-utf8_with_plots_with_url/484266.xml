<plot>This show was an irregularly scheduled hour long program that gave more complete coverage of issues. The show consisted of 'Edward R. Murrow (I)' (qv) sitting in the New York studio talking about the topic of the week. The most significant show was on 9 March 1954 during the McCarthy Era. Murrow showed a series of film clips of Senator 'Joseph McCarthy (II)' (qv) and revealed how shallow he was and how he lied to promote his programs. Other major shows were: 20 October 1953: "The Case Against Milo Radulovich, AO589839" that revealed how the US Air Force was trying to discharge Lieutenant Radulovich because it was suspected that his Serbian father and sister were Communist sympathizers; after the show, the Secretary of the Air Force, Harold E. Talbott, reviewed the case and Radulovich was reinstated. 24 November 1953: "Argument in Indianapolis" revealed how the local American Legion post refused to allow the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to use their hall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484266</url></doc>
