<plot>Kindle is set inside the world of a youth refuge and tells the story of Hayley, a fourteen year old girl who wants to get the new boy, Terrence, to take notice of her. But Terrence is older, mysterious, and has some dark secrets, which Hayley discovers when she follows him on his first day as he commits an act of arson. Things are further complicated when it's revealed that Hayley is pregnant. Already on thin ice at the home, Hayley should be behaving better, but she's intrigued by Terrence and does what she can to get him to acknowledge her. It's only when Terrence snaps in a fit of anger and attacks their youth worker Kerry, that Hayley in an attempt to prevent Terrence from further and more serious violence, lights a fire in their home. In that act of sacrifice she discovers the power of fire, and he is able to see that she understands him. Both learn that in discovering their similarities, connection and love are kindled.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292287</url></doc>
