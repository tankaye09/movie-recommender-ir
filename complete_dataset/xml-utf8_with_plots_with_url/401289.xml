<plot>Joe has been feeling a lot of pressure lately. It's not because of his family. Joe has made his family proud. He has just graduated from a prestigious college and it looks as though he will follow the strict blueprint set before him: working for his father as an investment banker. Maybe it's his girlfriend. Joe's secret girlfriend, Nikki, is edgy and has an artistic lifestyle that would never be accepted by his family. But the pressure isn't because of her, either. It comes from a dream he's been having. A dream of New York City being completely destroyed by a nuclear explosion. The last time he had that dream, he wasn't asleep.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401289</url></doc>
