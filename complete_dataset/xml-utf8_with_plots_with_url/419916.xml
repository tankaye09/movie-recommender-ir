<plot>Maki, a young Japanese girl, secretly works as a porn star to get some money for eye surgery. But the story gets out when a neighbour gets a copy of Maki's film and her mother is furious. Maki is urged to quit her job but she refuses to do so and even threatens her mother that she will become a prostitute instead. Their quarrel is not finished when suddenly her grandmother shows up after escaping from a nursing home. She accused her daughter and her grand daughter of conspiring to get rid of her. Unable to cope with the situation at home, Maki runs away and stays with her boyfriend, a foreigner, Rudy, an Indonesian who works in Tokyo. Their relationship isn't approved of by her mother, but for Rudy, Maki is willing to go and work things out with her family. Is Rudy really an honest person? What's Maki's biggest secret that she kept from her mother, grandmother and even Rudy? Is it a lie, is it love or is it just life?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419916</url></doc>
