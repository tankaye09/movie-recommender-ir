<plot>Things are not what they seem at a lonely bus stop nestled in a small New England town. It's a crisp winter morning with a landscape painted of fresh snow. A beggar takes shelter from the frozen wind and in his hand he clutches a brown paper bag. During his stay, he encounters three young ladies going shopping, a jogger, a business woman and a newly married couple. Each views him from their own perspective. They come and go, but he does not follow. A bus pulls up, but he does not board. With the hint of something "more" in his demeanor, he just waits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645878</url></doc>
