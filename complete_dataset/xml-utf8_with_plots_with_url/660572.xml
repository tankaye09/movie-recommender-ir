<plot>Woody is getting his hair cut at the local barber when suddenly, said barber walks right out on him (it's his lunch break). What's worse, a news report states that Louie the lion has escaped from the circus. Sure enough, Louie enters the barber shop and forces Woody to hide him from the cops. The cops enter but Woody sends them away ("There's no lion here"). However, Woody soon learns that there is a reward offered for whoever captures Louie. Woody offers the lion a "disguise", luring him into a trap and molding a vase over his head. Finally, the ringmaster looking for Louie arrives but is turned off by the lion's now hideous appearance and refuses Woody the reward.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660572</url></doc>
