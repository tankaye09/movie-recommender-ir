<plot>Shepherds generally have a hard and quiet life, walking their sheep flock over green hills with only the blue sky above their heads, away from the turbulent civilization. So is Jean and his fellow shepherds, Mihail and Patru found by the filming crew in Sibiel, doing daily duties near their sheep pasture. So far so good but some nifty Germans build a noisy airfield near the quiet sheep farm. The film depicts the emotionally moving relationship between the shepherds and the strange machines flying above their heads.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106803</url></doc>
