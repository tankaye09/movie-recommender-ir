<plot>In the late nineties a new TV game show, "E.S.T" or the "Kelvin Game Show" is aired in Britain. The contestants will become patients and will be psychoanalyzed. Based on the real-life TV game show 'The Kelvin Game Show' where 'patients' are psychoanalyzed in the dark and are locked in a house for one month. The project is a journey into the brain of four contestants. Their state of mind is measured by 2 thermometers, one filtering the Kelvin degree and the other the EST degree, a mental state. The winner of this experiment is the contestant who will survive this ordeal. The film opens many years later on with 2 of the contestants watching episodes of the TV show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112911</url></doc>
