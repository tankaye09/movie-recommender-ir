<plot>John Taske survived a disastrous Mount Everest expedition that claimed nine lives and was documented in the best-selling book "Into Thin Air." Having turned back 200 meters before reaching the Everest summit, John feels unfinished business. High Ambitions follows John returning to the unforgiving Himalayan environment with new teammates. Their expedition attempts a mountain in the Everest region named Cho Oyu. It's one of fourteen prized mountains known as the 8000-meter peaks (with summits above 26,000 feet) all located in the Himalayas. Each climber candidly shares his unfolding experience and reflections upon oxygen deprivation, extreme cold, and brushes with other teams' tragedies. The climbers, sometimes impassioned and sometimes humbled, discover new personal insights as they quest for one of the world's highest summits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238737</url></doc>
