<plot>A World War II veteran, en route to Chicago, stops at the home of the mother of a close friend of his who died in the war. She invites him in, then turns cold and suspicious when she hears his name, Maxie Klein. Her son wrote about his friends and didn't mention any Max Klein. She shows Klein her son's letters; he explains that her son Jack always called him Joe-Joe. Jack's mother softens, and Max reads to her from the last letter he got from Jack. By the story's end, mom has softened and learned a thing or two about tolerance. The film was sponsored in part by B'nai B'rith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012252</url></doc>
