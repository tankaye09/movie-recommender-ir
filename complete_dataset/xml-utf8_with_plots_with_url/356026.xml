<plot>From the Greek play Lysistrata to the Greek system on US campuses, Manfast draws from a broad range of influences to deliver edgy humor and contemporary commentary. The story follows four hard-partying, post-feminist, self-labelled "manaholics" who live in the affectionately-named "House of Babes" in Tallahasseee, and publish a struggling zine titled Biotch. While famous for their festive ways, the babes wonder if there is more to life and love. Their chance to find out comes in the form of a grad student friend who needs a household of women to study for her MA thesis. Her proposition? She'll pass on her grant money to them to save Biotch, if they'll abstain from contact with men for 100 days. With trepidation, the babes take up the challenge. As the local media takes note, and the group's men start to grow restless, one babe's father ups the ante. He announces on a national talk show that he'll grant $1,000,000 to the first man to break the fast. Hoardes of men descend on the small college town, and the babes find themselves in the center of a media storm about feminism and culture. Along the way they learn more about themselves, love, and the art of war between the sexes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356026</url></doc>
