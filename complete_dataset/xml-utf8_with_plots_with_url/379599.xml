<plot>Fed up with life and his domineering mom, Paul channels his frustrations into the creation of his newest comic character, Mr. Cynic; a disillusioned superhero who no longer feels that humanity is worth protecting from the forces of evil. After another failed pitch, Paul quits art only to discover that Mr. Cynic has materialized in his studio apartment. Caught in the crossfire between his mom and his muse, both of whom claim to know what is in his best interest, Paul's life comes to a crumbling halt as he is forced to choose between disowning his mother or destroying his greatest creation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379599</url></doc>
