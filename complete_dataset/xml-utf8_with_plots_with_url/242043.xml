<plot>Michael Cooper was the mayor of a small Midwestern community. He was an honest, decent man--maybe too honest for the staff around him, who were always worried that Cooper's deeds may not be to his advantage politically. Cooper was basically a conservative, although his children, Annie and James, were radical leftwingers. Cooper also had an odd tendency to break into song at least once every episode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?242043</url></doc>
