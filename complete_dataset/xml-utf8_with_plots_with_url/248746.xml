<plot>This is a very amusing picture taken on a picturesque country road in England, showing the efforts of the village constables to stop speeding of automobiles through the village. First is seen a double-seater coming along at high speed and a constable steps out from behind a tree in the middle of the road and attempts to stop the machine. The motor car strikes him full on and tears him limb from limb. A very amusing scene occurs as the dismembered limbs are seen slowly coming together and joining automatically. The injured man is picked up by his companions and carried away. Soon another motor car comes speeding up, and this time a heavy weight constable undertakes the job of stopping it. He turns his back to the machine which strikes him and abruptly rebounds to the side of the road. The constable then proceeds to arrest the occupants of the automobile and carry them off to the village jail. The film is of very fine photographic value.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248746</url></doc>
