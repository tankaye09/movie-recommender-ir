<plot>A human skeleton is placed upon a table by an attendant. When the attendant leaves the room the skeleton begins kicking his legs and throwing his arms about and suddenly turns into a magician. The magician produces an egg, performing several sleight-of-hand tricks, and places it upon the table with the small end downward. He then crudely draws a human face upon the shell, and the egg immediately begins growing larger and larger until it reaches the size of a normal head. The form of the egg fades away and there immediately appears the head of a very pretty girl. Then two or more of the same type appear on either side of the original. The heads of the girls are merged into one head and from this appears the hideous head of a hobgoblin. The hobgoblin fades away into the original egg. The egg is reduced to its normal size and is removed from the table by the magician, who swallows it. He then takes his place on the table, reverting back to the skeleton, which is removed by the attendant, thus closing the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?303955</url></doc>
