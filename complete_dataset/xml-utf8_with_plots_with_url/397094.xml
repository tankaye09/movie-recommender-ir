<plot>Tim plans to spend his 21st birthday at his Scottish estate with eight of his closest friends. Amongst the excitement of rediscovering old friendships, no one minds that a snowstorm has cut them off from the rest of the outside world. Everything is set for the perfect weekend, until one of the guests stumbles across an old history of the house with the power to unleash the horrors of Scotland's past. The book tells of Murray, the old Scot patriot, who has had his eyes torn out and his house taken away during the English invasion. Intent on exacting bloody revenge on the reunited English friends Murray possesses the body of a guest and turns him into a murderer. He seems impossible to stop as when the possessed guest is killed, Murray passes into the killer to continue his mission of murdering all nine of them. It is survival of the fittest as the friendships are pushed to the limit. No one can guess who the next killer will be or how to break the chain. Only one will survive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?397094</url></doc>
