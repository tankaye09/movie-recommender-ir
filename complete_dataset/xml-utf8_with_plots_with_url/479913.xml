<plot>In November 1898, the first and only successful Coup D'etat to occur on US soil took place in Wilmington, North Carolina. The local, conservative Democratic Party forcibly toppled the city's duly elected government, including two African American Aldermen. How is it possible that almost no one in the town of Wilmington knows about this significant piece of history? Now, over 100 years later, we find Wilmington a racially separated city with a definitive socio-economic disparity. What effects did the 1898 race riots have on the condition of the community today? Are there any psychological or economic scars left in Wilmington today? What steps must be taken to heal these wounds? What are the steps needed to be taken to right our past wrongs? These are the questions investigated in this Documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479913</url></doc>
