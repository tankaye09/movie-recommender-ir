<plot>Fin de si√©cle elegance. A parade of sorts passes in front of a stationary camera. An ostrich pulls a cart in which two well-dressed girls sit, two mules pull a large cart full of children, two horses pass with children astride, a camel follows with two children atop; last comes a large elephant with children on top and a small elephant alongside. Each animal, except the baby elephant, is decked out and each is attended by at least one man. The children are all in hats and frills. After the animals pass, we see adults out for a walk, the women with parasols and the men with silk hats.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052139</url></doc>
