<plot>Endangered takes a look at the scarcity of the eligible Aboriginal male, and the effects this has on Aboriginal women looking for love and the survival of Aboriginal people and culture. When people tell me there are plenty of more fish out in the sea, I shake my head in disagreement and tell them 'no there isn't, especially when it comes to eligible Aboriginal men'. These men should be placed on the endangered species list of Australia, I say. Why? Because we only make up 2% of the entire population. Divide that in half and you have around 150,000 Aboriginal men in this country. Most of these men are either gay, 'married up', have a number of kids around the countryside, they only like non-Aboriginal women, or non-Aboriginal women only want Aboriginal children/men, I'm (unfortunately) related to most of the good ones; and more seriously, most are incarcerated or dying young. How does someone like me find one?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178298</url></doc>
