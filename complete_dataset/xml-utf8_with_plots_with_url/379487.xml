<plot>After her brother, Sebastian Burns, confesses and is convicted of murder, Tiffany Burns takes a closer look at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police undercover sting known as "Mr.Big" during which the police pose as organized criminals, offering their target money and threatening violence while seeking confessions for unsolved murders. The film blends Tiffany's deeply personal story with her search for the facts about the sting: why "Mr.Big" is legal in Canada when many experts consider the scenario to be coercive entrapment. During her journey she meets several people who have made false confessions and spent years in jail for murders they didn't commit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379487</url></doc>
