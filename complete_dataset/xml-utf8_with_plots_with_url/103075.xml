<plot>A light but funny gameshow which enjoyed only a blip run during the early '80s, "Child's Play" pitted the wits of two contestants in a guessing game of deceptive simplicity. Young children were interviewed and asked to give their descriptions or definitions of everyday items, phrases, or events without using the actual word itself. Sometimes the responses were helpful; other times, inaccurate or misleading; but very often humorous and always insightful. Upon viewing such clips the contestants then had to guess at what the children were describing, with the player who had figured out the most correct answers winning the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103075</url></doc>
