<plot>A car travels across a long bridge, headed for a big city. Although we don't see them, we hear a man and a woman talk about old times. Not everything is entirely in focus; the images are grainy. After awhile, the car arrives at a retirement home, and one of the travelers is welcomed as a new arrival. It's a cheery place. The new resident is wheeled to his room and lifted onto the bed. We get a glimpse of him, and, as the rest home's public address system calls on other residents to join an activity, it all becomes clear, including why things are slightly out of focus.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578815</url></doc>
