<plot>How many are the couples in Bulgaria, whose natural desire to have children have turned into a sad and ominous feeling of blankness? Is medicine able to make amends and offer what nature has deprived them of? The film presents the IN VITRO method and searches the balance between the 'pros' and 'cons'.
