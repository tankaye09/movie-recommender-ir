<plot>As the years pass and technology advances, people find more and more interesting ways to amuse themselves. My Toys will show audiences what people in China and around the world do to pass their time. From toys that are still being designed by scientists to games that have been played for hundreds of years, this series will show audiences every possible way to have fun. Each week the host, He Xin, will introduce various toys to the audience. Antique toys meant for display and off road vehicles designed to tackle the harshest terrain highlight each 30 minute episode. Driving a Hummer up a mountain, flying a glider or solving an ancient puzzle are just some of the adventures He Xin will have in every show. My Toys will make anyone feel like a kid again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659445</url></doc>
