<plot>"This is one of the 'hit' pictures of the Biograph. In a cornfield at the edge of a barnyard are seated two young women and a young man engtaged in husking corn. Tradition gives whoever finds the red ear the reward of a kiss from the first girl the finder can catch. Our picture shows the finding of the red ear, and the consequent struggle for the reward. It is all very prettily worked out, and the fun very spontaneous."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655346</url></doc>
