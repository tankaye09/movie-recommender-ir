<plot>When Eddie disappears in the Yucatan, Pete abandons his comfortable life in Toronto to search for his lifelong best friend, a charming Texas ne'er-do-well. Arriving in Mexico with his girlfriend Zoe and pal Dave, they discover a world that is deeper and darker than any tourist image of Cancun. As the hunt progresses, Pete encounters old love Kate who is now Eddie's girlfriend. Meanwhile, several local Mexicans disappeared at the same time as Eddie - a fact noticed by a popular barfly who befriends Pete - who also happens to be retired Texas Border Patrol. Eddie's sudden reappearance only adds to the puzzle as he deflects all questions by distracting them with Southern charm and promise of local adventures. And with Eddie's return, Pete must reluctantly relinquish his role of savior for Kate, who has blinders on to their real circumstances. With this, Pete learns there is more than one way to "disappear" and a startling discovery uncovers more about his past and his former friend than he can bear. All this set against the glorious backdrop of Mayan Ruins, stunning beaches, underground rivers and a beautiful country wrestling with its history of racism and its convoluted relationship with "Norteamericanos". The overall effect is of a complicated, character driven dramatic thriller tempered by the possibility of personal redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553210</url></doc>
