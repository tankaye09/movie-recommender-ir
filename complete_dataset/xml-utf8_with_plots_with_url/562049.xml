<plot>Yearly series produced by the Playboy Channel. A group of men and women compete in this contest to see who is voted the best male and female stripper of the year. Each contestant does a routine set to music and starts out in costume (policeman, for example). The order of contestants alternates back-and-forth between female and male competitors, and the contestants strip down to their G-strings (so no one gets entirely naked in this contest). Winners were determined by a panel of judges. Lyle Waggoner co-hosted the festivities and introduced the female strippers, while his female co-host introduced the men.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562049</url></doc>
