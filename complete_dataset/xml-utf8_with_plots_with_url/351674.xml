<plot>Magdalena Welling (Amy Shelton-White) wasn't always a recluse, living in an abandoned warehouse, surrounded by outdated computers, archaic medical equipment, and responsibilities almost too great to bear. She was once a successful surgeon; her husband Arthur (Sanjiban), a brilliant scientist. But now, they exist in a world of emptiness and solitude, continuing the radical artificial intelligence research that Arthur had started a lifetime before. Before the accident. Now, after four years of ceaseless work, they've made a breakthrough, a discovery so great that it could change the face of science. But it will also require a sacrifice so great, that Magdalena's world will never be the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351674</url></doc>
