<plot>Reconciliation, pivots around one day in which an estranged couple are ready to part, but find reconciliation in the mundane acts of the everyday, eating, cleaning, and reading the paper. Even though they are odds with each other, and are too proud to speak about how difficult it is, or even speak at all, they do not acknowledge the world beyond the parameters of their apartment. Yet this world is always present, in the light coming in the window, and the sounds of he street, and finally at the end, somehow reconciled, they are able to see themselves, in the cityscape, as part of something larger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457728</url></doc>
