<plot>Nothing is as mischievous as childhood, and this picture certainly shows what a tease a healthy, lively child can be. She has taken six little puppies away from their mother and lets them play a few minutes in a can of milk, so to see what they would do. She takes can away from them; then there is trouble and lots of it. Fine action and amusing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584715</url></doc>
