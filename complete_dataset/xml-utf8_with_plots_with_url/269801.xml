<plot>IT CAME FROM KUCHAR is the definitive, feature documentary about the legendary, underground filmmaking twins, the Kuchar brothers. George and Mike Kuchar have inspired two generations of filmmakers, actors, musicians, and artists with their zany, "no budget" films and with their uniquely enchanting spirits. George and Mike Kuchar grew up in the Bronx in the 1950's making "no-budget" films, compulsively copying Hollywood melodramas with their aunt's 8mm, home-movie camera. In the 1960's the New York underground film scene embraced them as the "8mm Mozarts". Their early films deeply inspired many filmmakers, including John Waters, Buck Henry, Atom Egoyan, Todd Haynes, Cory McAbee and Wayne Wang. IT CAME FROM KUCHAR includes numerous clips from the Kuchar brother's early films including HOLD ME WHILE I'M NAKED, SINS OF THE FLESHAPOIDS, and many others. IT CAME FROM KUCHAR features interviews of many of the filmmakers, artists and writers who've been inspired by the Kuchars. The film also features interviews of key "actors" from the Kuchar's films, ranging from the earliest days in the Bronx through today. For close to forty years George has taught film production at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI). His class is unbelievable in a circus-like, Fellini-esque style that generates tremendous enthusiasm from his students. IT CAME FROM KUCHAR follows his latest class production as they make an over-the-top "monster picture".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269801</url></doc>
