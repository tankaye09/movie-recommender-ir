<plot>F SCOTT FITZGERALD SLEPT HERE explores the intimacy between men and the dynamics of unlikely matchups. Paul is a scruffy, white girl-hungry FTM poet. Gordon, on the other hand, is an overachieving black student who is balancing his identity as a gay man with his conservative professional aspirations. While it seems like they couldn't be less alike, the more we learn about Paul and Gordon, the more we find out that they both are struggling with the same question: How do I fit in? F SCOTT FITZGERALD SLEPT HERE is about the decisions that friends make for each other and for themselves, and what happens when they can't be synchronized. Paul and Gordon are unbeatable together, or at least that's what they thought. They can take on the world but can they survive each other?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186823</url></doc>
