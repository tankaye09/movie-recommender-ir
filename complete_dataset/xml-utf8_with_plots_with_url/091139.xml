<plot>A man enters a public bathroom hoping to be able to do his business and get out without any fuss. But today that isn't going to be how it pans out. His door won't lock and he has to get down to business totally vulnerable. As soon as he gets comfortable (as comfortable as he can be) he hears a man in the other cubicle talk. "Hello there?" A little worried, he responds, but the man keeps talking, "How are you?" Again he responds, hoping the conversation will end there: The man in the other stall seems incorrigible and keeps talking as though he's flirting. He eventually asks "can I come over?" and the conversation must end there! "NO! I'm busy at the moment!" There's a pause and the man in the other cubicle sighs. "Listen, I'll have to call you back. There's an idiot here who keeps answering all my questions."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091139</url></doc>
