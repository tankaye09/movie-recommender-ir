<plot>An African-Canadian woman goes in search of her roots, when transplanted into a new city. At first she is lost and fragmented, her grandmother appears to her in a vision and forces her to look at herself. It opens her up to her own inner world. In this world beneath the surface she starts whirling (an ancient Sufi prayer-dance said to be a gateway between the physical and the spiritual world). Through whirling, she connects to herself and is now able to accept the community around her. The metaphor fr community in this film is the window ech other behind our layer of cultural skin. In order to find herself the woman must travel past skin and into bone. Once awakened, she finds pride in her cultural heritage AND finds community in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032310</url></doc>
