<plot>It is 14th century Yuan Dynasty China, the country is under Mongolian rule and the star-crossed lovers, Jinha (Shin Hyun-june) and Sullie (Kim Hee-sun), illegitimate daughter of a Mongolian commander, are caught in the middle. When her mother died, Sullie√ïs father, Taruga, took her away and later planned to marry her off to form an alliance with a powerful Chinese warlord. Things get worse when Jinha learns that Taruga was the person who ordered the massacre of his entire family. Fuelled by hatred, he masters his family secret martial arts, the Bichun Secret Art. Many top pugilists, who are also after the secret scroll, try to kill him. During one of such attempts, Junkwang, a rich and powerful son of a Han lord, helps Jinha. But fate has it that Junkwang is the person that Sullie is forced to marry. When Junkwang knows about their love, he plots to have Jinha killed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068721</url></doc>
