<plot>This off-beat romance centers on the love affair that blossoms between a pair of homeless outcasts. Veteran Sam has never recovered from his tour of Vietnam. With noting left but his knowledge, he earns coins with his poor recitations of Shakespeare. Equally traumatized Sarah ended up in the streets when a fire destroyed her home and family. She lives alone in an abandoned building. They meet when Sam saves Sarah from being beaten up by a gang. As he takes care of her broken body and spirit, a tentative relationship begins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475239</url></doc>
