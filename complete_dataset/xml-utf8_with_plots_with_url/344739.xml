<plot>It's 1973 - Hippie love, the Beatles, Vietnam, Watergate. In Chile, the Socialist president, Salvador Allende, is in power. And in these heady, chaotic days of politics, optimism, and subterfuge, the working classes have a newfound belief that things may finally be swinging in their favor. Demonstrations are frequent, political discourse is rampant. Yet, Nixon and Kissinger, afraid of a new "communist" state in South America, grant millions of dollars to the CIA to bring Allende's democratically-elected government down. When a coup takes place on September 11, 1973, orchestrated by Augusto Pinochet and the American CIA, human rights take a backseat to imprisonment, torture, and murder.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344739</url></doc>
