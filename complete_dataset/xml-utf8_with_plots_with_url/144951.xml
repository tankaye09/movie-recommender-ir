<plot>Portly Dick Rich energetically leads his nonette, the Melodious Monarchs, through three numbers. All are dressed well in tuxedos, and the simple background is ritzy. Dick sings "Ramona," then he's joined by his wife Cheri for "There Must Be a Silver Lining." Next, Dick and Cheri do a ventriloquism act in which Cheri mouths the words that Dick says, sings, and screeches with his head out of sight behind her. The set closes with a duet of "Sunshine." The curtain closes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144951</url></doc>
