<plot>On July 12, 1928 one of Mexico's greatest aviators fatally crashed his plane in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Capt. Emilio Carranza was only 23 years old when he died. His crash occurred during the return trip from of reciprocal goodwill tour in response to his friend Charles Lindbergh's visit to Mexico. A year after his crash the local V.F.W. Post 11 of Mount Holly, NJ, the group responsible for posting guard over the fallen aviator's body, held a memorial service that has continued for over three quarters of a century. Goodwill, the documentary film, presents Carranza's life and the legacy he has left in both Mexico and the United States of America. The film goes further as it investigates the differences between Carranza's legacy in these two nations brought on by social, political, and historical factors. Finally, the film is meant to be bring another layer to Carranza and Lindbergh's goal of establishing a lasting goodwill between these two nations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220302</url></doc>
