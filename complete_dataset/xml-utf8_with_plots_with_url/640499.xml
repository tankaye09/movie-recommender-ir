<plot>Widowed Lala Yodhraj Bhalla lives in a palatial house with his daughter, Suman, and son, Shashiraj. Both of his children are of marriageable age. He gets a shock when he finds out that Suman is in love with a lowly employee by the name of Ajit Bhardwaj, and refuses to give his consent for their marriage. Suman and Ajit get married in a simple ceremony, and Suman moves to Ajit's house, where she soon gets pregnant and gives birth to a son who they name Vikram alias Vicky. Yodhraj gets another shock when Shashiraj tells him that he would like to marry Rita, who comes from a poor family. Yodhraj asks Shashiraj to for a trip out of town in his private air-plane. With Shashiraj out of the way, Yodhraj goes to a pregnant Rita and asks her never to see Shashiraj again and leaves a blank cheque with her. The very same day, Shashiraj is killed when his plane crashes; a guilt-ridden Suman moves back into her father's house along with Vikram, leaving Ajit alone; and a lone Rita gives birth to a young son. Twenty five years later, Yodhraj still lives in his palatial house with Suman and Vikram. One day while paying salaries to his staff, he is told that there is no money in the bank. It is then Yodhraj finds out that Rita has cashed the blank cheque he had given to her 25 years ago. Now Yodhraj must find out why Rita chose to wait all these years to cash this cheque - and what he finds will change his life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640499</url></doc>
