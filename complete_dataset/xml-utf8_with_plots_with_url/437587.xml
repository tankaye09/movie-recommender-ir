<plot>"A remarkably fine picture photographically, showing a group of trained athletes pole vaulting at the Columbia Athletic Field. Five ten-foot vaults are included in the negative. This picture has been used with great success in reverse motion, the effect of the men leaping backward over the bar, and catching the pole in mid-air being extremely ludicrous."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?437587</url></doc>
