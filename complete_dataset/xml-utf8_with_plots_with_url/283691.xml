<plot>Ranjit Verma (Raj Babbar) is the lawyer and legal counsel for a criminal named Veljibhai Soda (Paresh Rawal). Due to this association, Ranjit's brother, Ravi (Sanjay Dutt) also get involved with Veljibhai. Veljibhai trusts Ravi and asks him to intimidate Ustad Ali Mohammed (Aloknath), so that he can take possession of his property, but Ustad Ali is not intimidated by Ravi or by Veljibhai, his men, and a corrupt police inspector (Avtar Gill) and refuses to let go of this property. Ravi feels sympathy for Ustad Ali and becomes his follower. This angers Velji, and Ranjit as well, and they try to talk to Ravi, but to no avail. Veljibhai then takes matters into his own hands and must not only get rid of Ustad Ali, but also Ravi, and Ranjit as well. Will Veljibhai succeed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283691</url></doc>
