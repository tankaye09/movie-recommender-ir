<plot>Rising high above the clouds is a near derelict council skyscraper, where Emily lives with her abusive father, a volatile and jealous man whose hatred for his daughter has been spurred by the loss of his wife. Emily spends her days alone and confined to the flat, cooking, cleaning, washing, and nervously walking on eggshells to appease him. Emily has always been intrigued by the unknown contents of a forbidden and unreachable cupboard, which she suspects may relate to her dead and unmentioned mother. One day she musters her efforts to reach as high as she can, up to the cupboard, and the findings unlock a license for imagination that empowers her to break free and find solace in the outside world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375032</url></doc>
