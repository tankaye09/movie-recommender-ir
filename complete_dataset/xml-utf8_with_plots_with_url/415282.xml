<plot>Colin flees to a barn, the sheath of his sword slapping against the leg of his jeans. Chasing him are a mysterious knight on horseback and his armored henchman, who in the course of their pursuit capture a woman in red. Colin prepares to battle the knights as a series of flashbacks reveal the source and nature of his delusions. He attempts to negotiate the overlapping worlds of reality and hallucination as their borders decompose and the knights draw closer. His threats begin to vanish, but so do his weapons and his defenses until he finds himself pinned to the ground by his frantic brother. The woman in red must then make a choice that will either obviate all his struggles or redeem him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415282</url></doc>
