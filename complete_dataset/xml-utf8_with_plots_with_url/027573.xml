<plot>Inspector Vijay Verma is a very lonely cop whose only family is a younger brother Ajay Verma who is studying abroad. He also has two good friends Shekhar and Seema. One day when he arrests the criminal mastermind Jojo Braganza, he is shocked when Jojo is released from police custody because his corrupt lawyer shows the court a video tape showing him at a completely different place so therefore he couldn't have committed the crime. From this day on they become enemies and Vijay is hot on Jojo's trail every time he commits a crime. One day while watching a film called Seeta Aur Geeta, he realizes that two people can be at different places at the same time if they are twins. He realizes that Jojo has a twin brother called Tony who covers for him each time he commits a crime so he can get away with it easily. He successfully gets Jojo arrested and put in prison. However Jojo escapes and hides out at the house of Shekhar and Seema. When Shekhar realizes that Tony and Jojo are wanted criminals., he tries to contact Vijay. But Tony and Jojo find out and kill both Shekhar and Seema. Vijay is devastated by the loss of his two best friends and is comforted by nightclub dancer Sapna whom he falls in love with. After the death of his friends, he finds out Tony and Jojo now have his younger brother Ajay on their hit list so he sets out trying to stop them. However his police commissioner Shashi Kapoor warns him not to take the law into his hands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027573</url></doc>
