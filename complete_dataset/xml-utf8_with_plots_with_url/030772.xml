<plot>This film follows, over two years, the eventful lives of five diverse young men as they each struggle to come to terms with their fathers and chart a course for their own fathering identity. Each one in his own way moves from trepidation to confidence and emerges with a clearer picture of who they are.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030772</url></doc>
