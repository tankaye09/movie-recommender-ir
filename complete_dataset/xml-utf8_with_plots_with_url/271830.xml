<plot>Jack &amp; Jill is a love story based on the 1st and 2nd verses of the classic nursery rhyme set to the New Zealand landscape. This short film is accompanied by an adaptation of the rhyme's tune, enhancing the mood of the sinister tale. Jack &amp; Jill are two Kiwi kids falling in love. Seeking privacy they arrange to meet at a remote beach at the foothills of Titahi Bay. They head up the hills unaware of the potentially dangerous cliff-face, Jack, distracted, falls down the cliff but managed to hold onto the edge. Jill in her rush to help also falls, but does not survive. Badly concussed Jack stumbles onto the beach mourning his lost 1st love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271830</url></doc>
