<plot>A feelgood musical comedy-drama set in the Country and Western underworld of Dudley in the West Midlands, this is an innocent story of ordinary folk living their lives to the full. When Merle and Marleen Pearle get the chance to enter the national country and western dance championships and win a trip to Dollywood they jump at it, but their rise to stardom is beset with trials and tribulations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320392</url></doc>
