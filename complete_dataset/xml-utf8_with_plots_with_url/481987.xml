<plot>Series that began simply as a medium for airing horror and science fiction movies, with some voice overs from Jerry G. Bishop. Soon, Bishop began to appear in videotaped segments as "Svengoolie", between episodes and commercial breaks. One of the writers on the show was young Rich Koz who went on to use the Svengoolie character to great success on the TV show of the same name. Weird segments with a talking skull named Zelda and a ventriloquist's dummy named Durwood were the norm.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481987</url></doc>
