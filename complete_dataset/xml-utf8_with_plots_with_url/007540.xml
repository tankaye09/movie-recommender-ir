<plot>Obituary writer Robert is a heavy set gay man who is perfectly happy with his single, solitary life... or so he thinks. After being pried out of his apartment and coerced into a West Hollywood gay bar by close friend Rick, he meets John, another stocky gay man. John confesses his attraction to Robert, and invites him to a pool party at his house. At the urging of his best friend, the straight family man Andy, Robert reluctantly attends the party. As he steps into the gathering, Robert finds a gay community all his own - heavy, hairy gay guys and their admirers, collectively known as "The Bears". As Robert and John's relationship moves forward, Robert becomes more and more confident and outgoing, eventually allowing himself to commit fully to John and to the idea that life has more to offer than he had ever dared to imagine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007540</url></doc>
