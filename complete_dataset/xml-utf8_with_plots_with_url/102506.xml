<plot>This scene showing the fast flyer, The Chicago Portland Special, on the O. R. N. R'y. as it passes Rooster Rock on the Columbia River. It is one of the best train scenes ever made, sharp and clear, the train can be seen as it passes between the rocks in the distance, and as it emerges from Rooster Rocks the reflection can be plainly seen in the water, making this a scene of more than special interest to the exhibitor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102506</url></doc>
