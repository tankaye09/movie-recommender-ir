<plot>Three teams, each comprised of two contestants, attempted to guess a numerical response to an improbable question (e.g. how many miles a man could walk on a treadmill before the half-hour is up). One team member responded, then the second, and then the contestants on the second and third teams guessed. The teams' responses were then averaged, after which the correct answer was revealed; the team that came closest won $100, and the second closest team won $75. The teams played four more rounds, with each question's value increasing up to $1000 for the closest and $500 for the second closest (during the final round). The winning team kept their cash award and then proceeded to the "Brainteaser" bonus round. To win the bonus, the team had to be +/- 25% of the correct answer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270031</url></doc>
