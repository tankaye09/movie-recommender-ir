<plot>Carver Court is a housing project in Orlando, Florida, and home to more than 200 families. As in most communities, a gulf existed between Carver Court's youth and its elders, many of whom had lived there more than fifty years. To help bridge that gap, local teenagers decided to collect the remarkable stories of Carver Court's seniors: Mr. Lockhart's lifetime in the circus; Mrs. Siplin's memories of racial strife in depression-era Mississippi and Mr. Danner's harrowing experiences in a segregated Army unit during the Korean War. This film is a record of those histories, and of the bonds formed in their telling.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?095553</url></doc>
