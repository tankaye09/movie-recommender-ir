<plot>Further adventures of the _"Number 96" (1972)_ (qv) crew, on the big screen. After a devastating experience at the hands of a group of bikies Vera Collins recovers at the home of socialite friend Claire Houghton where she meets distinguished politician Nicholas Brent. She is romanced by him and worries that her shady past may harm his career but abruptly calls off the affair after a shock meeting with his son Tony. Dorrie and Herb begin arrangements for the celebration of their Ruby wedding anniversary with Roma, Arnold, Norma and Dudley all crossing wires and duplicating tasks while attempting to help out and cut costs. However a shocking discovery by Flo threatens to halt the celebrations and brings a new man into Dorrie's life. Meanwhile Aldo struggles to work two jobs after accidentally losing the money he had secretly pocketed in the deli to avoid paying income tax on it, and Lucy is suitably unimpressed after Les ropes Alf into his latest money-spinner; a sauna in the building's basement. Simon Carr returns as Vera and Maggie's business partner, while they reminisce about their earlier feud over him it seems someone else has caught his eye: Don Finlayson. Having recovered from her breakdown Sonia Vansard returns to Number 96 with her new husband Duncan, though she seems continually nervous and flustered. She renews acquaintance with good friend Jack Sellars and befriends her new neighbour Diana Moore who Jack is also romancing, though after several bizarre incidents and forgetful episodes begins to question her sanity. Dorrie and Herb's wedding celebration, a sumptuous costume affair, is finally held, but Vera is shocked to discover a fearsome gate-crasher at the party.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402785</url></doc>
