<plot>Defy gravity and stretch your game to the skies with NFL STREET 2. Send your receivers off walls, change passing lanes by running your QB up a building, and take advantage of eye-popping wall jukes and all-new hurdles. You better hold on to the ball because defenders fly across the field in ways never before seen in a football game. Descend on the world of Bay City, and build your team and battle plans one field at a time. Recruit talent from the neighborhoods you conquer as you begin your journey to become football's biggest street legend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?386927</url></doc>
