<plot>The story begins with Samsoon dealing with two devastating news- her fianc√© stood her up at their wedding, and their family's bakery was gutted by a fire. Samsoon then decides to apply as a pastry chef in a five-star restaurant where she crosses paths with the rich and arrogant Cyrus in a very unusual spot-the male comfort room where he gives her a piece of advice about love and men. Not long after, Cyrus will discover Samsoon's outstanding talent in baking and hires her to work in his restaurant. Cyrus has his share of problems too. His domineering mother insists that he marries soon. To be free of his mother's consistent prodding, Cyrus offers Samsoon a love contract-in which she must act as his girlfriend in exchange for a huge amount of money. He offers Samsoon the contract because he knows he will never fall for a girl like her. Although hesitant and furious about Cyrus's overconfidence, Samsoon takes the opportunity to pay her family's debts. Are they both brave enough to face the consequences of the love contract? Will their plan still work even if their former paramours-Hannah and Harvey-re-enters the picture? Can a gorgeous guy like Cyrus fall for a plump, boisterous girl like Samsoon?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027773</url></doc>
