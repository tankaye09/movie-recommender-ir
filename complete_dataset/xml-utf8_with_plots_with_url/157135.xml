<plot>Film inspired by true events. Roman Jacenko (played by Jerzy Kozakiewicz), a small village local photographer, lives in a shabby garret, which serves also as his lab and studio. He loves Beata, nice clerk in a nearby bank. Having often observed established procedures of money transport to and from the bank, and having received some information unawarely revealed by Beata, he decided to rob the car with cash. To make an alibi he recorded sounds of footsteps, whistling and typical lab actions, turned the tape player on while going out to rob, and locked the room door. In a camouflage of a road crash survivor (face covered with bandage), he stopped the car with money, shot dead the security guards and badly wounded Beata. The bag with robbed money was temporarily hidden in a waste dump. He's shocked and surprised when police officer soon knocked at his door... explaining that the police's staff photographer was ill and asking him to make photographs of the crime scene. That looked for him as opportunity to obliterate the traces of the crime and create false evidence...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?157135</url></doc>
