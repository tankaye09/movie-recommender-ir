But the question is, how best to use him? Fortunately, he comes complete with an owner's manual. Eva decides he should first clean up after the party, then make himself a bed on the sofa. The next morning, he surprises her with breakfast. When later Eva finds him taking a shower she is shocked by the sight of his nakedness.

Even so, soon his cheery kindnesses start getting on her nerves and she impulsively decides she simply must return him. Eva is surprised to regret sending him back. After searching the dark city in vain, she realizes how much she misses him. Never before has she been happier than finding him at home waiting for her. At last the kiss. In the morning, Eva wakes up in his arms.
