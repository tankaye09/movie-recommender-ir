<plot>Produced by the Army Pictorial Service, Signal Corps, with the cooperation of the Army Air Forces and the United States Navy, and released by Warner Bros. for the War Activities Committee, Motion Picture Industry, "Appointment in Tokyo" is the film story of four years of Pacific war detailing the history of the defeat of Japan. The path traces across the Pacific from Corregidor in 1942, General Wainwright's surrender, the Death March, Australia in peril, the turning points of Naval victory in the Coral Sea, land victory at Guadalcana, and air victory over a giant Japanese convoy in the Bismark Sea. Vast armies are marshaled in the Philippines as the Marines take Iwo Jima, and combined Army, Navy and Marine forces take Okinawa.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043821</url></doc>
