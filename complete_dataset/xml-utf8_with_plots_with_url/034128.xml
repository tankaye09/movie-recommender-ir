<plot>Radha lives a poor lifestyle in a small village in Punjab along with her widowed mom. She is an ardent devotee of Devi Maa Jagdambe and goes to Her Mandir to worship daily. One day she meets with another devotee, Roop, from Rampur, and both are attracted to each other. Her mother comes to know and approaches Roop's step-mother, Laajwanti, and father, Lala Sunderdas, who instantly approve, and Radha gets married and moves in to live with Roop. From the very first night she is subjected to abuse at the hands of her mother-in-law, who is also cruel to Roop. She asks Roop to accompany her brother, Chandrabhan, and continues to abuse Radha, making her do all the housework without feeding her adequately. Things get worse for Radha when she is told that Roop is having an affair with another woman, and shortly thereafter she is told that he has passed away in an accident. When she is molested by Chandrabhan, she complains to Laajwanti, who refuses to believe her, blames her for Roop's death and asks her to leave. The question remains: What will Radha do now, and where will she go?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034128</url></doc>
