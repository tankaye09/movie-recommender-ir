<plot>Indian Army Captain Vikram Masoom lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his wife, Rohini, and school-going daughter, Mohini. One day he witnesses an unknown man who a tattoo on the back of his hand leaving their bedroom, and immediately suspects his wife of having an affair. Rohini denies this, but Vikram does not believe her, and she leaves to go live elsewhere, leaving Vikram to bring up Mohini on his own. Years later Mohini has grown up, has learned self-defense and is enrolled in the local college where she meets and falls in love with fellow-student, Rahul. What Mohini does not know is that Rahul is not who he claims to be but has been recruited, by her dad's enemies,to seduce and eventually abduct her. The past will be re-visited when Vikram goes to rescue his daughter and also meet with the man with the tattoo he saw leaving their bedroom years ago.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664585</url></doc>
