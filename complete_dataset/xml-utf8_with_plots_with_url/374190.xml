<plot>Moe Norman may be the greatest golfer who ever lived. But we'll never know for sure. When golf was still an elite sport, the golf establishment that gages greatness turned him away. Who was this world-class golfer who carried his own bag? Who dressed and behaved so oddly? Norman is a high-school dropout and math prodigy. Is he a genius? Or did a childhood accident leave him with a different window on this world?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374190</url></doc>
