<plot>The Declaration of Independence famously grants us the right to pursue happiness. And Americans spend great amounts of time and energy chasing it. But for many people, we're not even sure what it is we're chasing. And so, inspired and intrigued by this "unalienable" right, documentary filmmaker Andrew Shapter set out on a cinematic road trip to explore the myths and the truths of the "pursuit of Happiness" in America. Shapter, Director of the critically acclaimed documentary Before The Music Dies, traveled coast-to-coast, speaking with all sorts of Americans. And the film provides an unequaled view into the hearts and minds of spiritual leaders like the Dalai Lama, philanthropists, authors, scholars, and everyday people, along with a few artists like John Mellencamp and Willie Nelson. So come along as together we explore common ground and navigate the road to happiness!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229432</url></doc>
