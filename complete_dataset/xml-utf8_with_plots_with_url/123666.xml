<plot>Living a poor lifestyle with his widowed mother, Shankar sells toys for a living, but is addicted to alcohol. He is attracted to Parvati, who also lives a poor lifestyle along with her step-brother, Jagat Narayan, his wife, and their daughter, Pushpa. After an argument with his mother, Shankar departs to the city, gives up drinking, earns a lot of money, and returns home just to time to pay off his mortgage. But his world will soon be shattered after he goes to ask for the hand of a now wealthy Parvati. This is where he will be forced to face his past, and ultimately be told that Parvati's marriage has been arranged elsewhere. Unable to live without Parvati, he takes up drinking again and heads on to a path of self-destruction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123666</url></doc>
