<plot>This Film is an intimate music portrait of American composer Frank Zappa, who lives secluded from the outside world at his home and music studio in Los Angeles, California. For the past ten years Zappa in composing has turned away from Rock and Roll music - for which he first became famous - and has been working on new, contemporary, orchestral electronic music; in solitude and beyond any commercial conventions or commitments. It is the first time that Zappa has allowed a film crew to study him during compositional work, actually filming the first moments of a new compositional process. By contrast, in a staged interview Zappa gives comments on music. This film seeks to reveal the sensetivities of Zappa's personality and character also beyond narrative content.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427478</url></doc>
