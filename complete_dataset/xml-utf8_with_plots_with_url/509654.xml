<plot>It's very late at night, two hours past the time that 16 year old Jeannie was supposed to be home from the movies. The focus on this taped drama is of the problems faced by parents and their teenage children. This was the fifth in a series of special programs aimed at helping cope with changes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509654</url></doc>
