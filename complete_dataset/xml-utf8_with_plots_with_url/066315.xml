<plot>The Best Ranger Competition is often referred to as the world's toughest competition.  This year twenty-three driven two-man Ranger teams compete for sixty non-stop hours to determine who will earn the prestigious title of BEST RANGER.   Before a passionate crowd of family, friends and fans, these Ranger teams will face dozens of challenges testing their strength, endurance and mental acuity.  What a soldier faces in the heat of battle may be unimaginable, but they must be prepared.  The Best Ranger Competition is a challenge, and a fight that tests the courage, the power and the heart of a soldier's soul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066315</url></doc>
