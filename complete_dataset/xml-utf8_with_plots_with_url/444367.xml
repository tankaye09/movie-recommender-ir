<plot>1941, a cold dawn, and two German soldiers, a Captain and a Private, are out hunting somewhere on the Eastern Front. The Captain lists all the possible animals that they might find in the deep forest lands around them. However today he is only interested in the spoor of the one sort of animal: man. Prisoners have escaped; they must be found, and dealt with. When it comes to the crunch will the private once more fail in his duty or will he be given a second chance, and who will be anointed with the blood of the first kill?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?444367</url></doc>
