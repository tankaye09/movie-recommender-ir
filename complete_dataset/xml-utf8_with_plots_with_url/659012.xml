<plot>With Us Or Against Us follows several Afghan-Americans in Fremont, California, as they struggle to cope with the anti-Afghan sentiments in America, and indeed the world. We meet compelling characters from all walks of life-writers, activists, students and shopkeepers-and learn from them what it means to be an Afghan in America today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659012</url></doc>
