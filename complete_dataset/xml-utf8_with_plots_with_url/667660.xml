<plot>In the 1980s, long before Snoop Dogg and the rest of his crew had found success, they were Westside gang members living a street lifestyle that often included run-ins with the law. Snoop himself spent time inside California's notorious "Youth Authority" - the CYA - which in recent years has come under court order for abusing and failing to rehabilitate youth. Bigg Snoop Dogg's Youth Authority: California will tell the story of the CYA, gang activity, and youth violence in a documentary based on Snoop's story (as told by Snoop himself) and the stories of those youths still in the struggle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667660</url></doc>
