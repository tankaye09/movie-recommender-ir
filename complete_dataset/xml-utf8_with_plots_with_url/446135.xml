<plot>This short, a companion to the feature film _Agony and the Ecstasy, The (1965)_ (qv), focuses on the sculpture of Michelangelo. After a short visit to Caprese, where the artist was born, and the town where he first studied his craft, we see many of his most important works. They include the Madonna of the Stairs, completed at age 15; the statues of the Medici Tombs; and his two most famous Biblical figures: David and Moses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446135</url></doc>
