<plot>It's Sunday morning. Sara reads Ben a survey that may reveal his happiness quotient. As Sara probes Ben's initial responses, simple questions give rise to discomforting memories. She asks him about his family, and there's a flashback to a recent visit home, in which he and his dad have little to say to each other. Sara asks if he'll introduce her to his parents? He gets defensive. He also thinks about another woman, Kathrine. Where is Ben and Sara's relationship headed? How happy is he?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229449</url></doc>
