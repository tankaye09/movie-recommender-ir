<plot>For a little boy named MacLaren (Riley Canter) his toys are his only friends. However as a rift between MacLaren and his inanimate friends form, they quickly begin to suspect each other. As MacLaren grows more and more paranoid of the toys plotting against him, he begins to learn that you can't always grow out of your toys. Sometimes they simply won't let you.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417680</url></doc>
