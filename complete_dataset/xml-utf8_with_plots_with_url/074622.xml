<plot>Blind Carbon Copy is a modern, cautionary comedy about the relationship between people and the technology they rely on to communicate. When the power mysteriously drops out in a computer firm, the inhabitants are thrust into a foreign situation where they must interact directly. Without the comforts of digital anonimity, they are helpless to do much but bumble their way through a maze of new and awkward problems. E-mail and digital networks have rendered these colleagues virtual strangers to each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074622</url></doc>
