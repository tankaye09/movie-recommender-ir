<plot>Miss Swiss is a 'trendy' film detailing a young Swiss-American's return to her homeland. The heart of this film is found in her revealing journey as she discovers just what it means to be Swiss and how much more there is to Switzerland, than the common American clich√©s. She is unequivocally fluent in English, French, and Swiss -German, as we learn to speak a few words in these languages, she communicates with local historians and guides to take us through the less familiar regions of Switzerland.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372294</url></doc>
