<plot>After the passing of their father, Rajaram Tiwari, a Member of Parliament, Rocky and his London-based sister, Manisha, lead a wealthy lifestyle. When Manisha returns home, Rocky arranges her engagement with her boyfriend, Pawan. Shortly after the engagement a number of strange and occult occurrences take place in their home, compelling Manisha to seek assistance from a Catholic as well an Hindu priest. Things only worsen when Rocky openly opposes her marriage with Pawan, and even attempts to choke her to death. Manisha does not know that her brother's body has been possessed by an evil, shape-changing, vengeful entity that has undertaken to prevent any marriages from taking place in her family - and there is no force on Earth that can stop it from carrying on it's gruesome task.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356896</url></doc>
