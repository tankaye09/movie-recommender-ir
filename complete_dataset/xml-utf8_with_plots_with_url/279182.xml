<plot>"This scene is laid in a prominent private park and opens by depicting the belated Jones returning from his club, clad in a dress suit, smoking a cigar, and armed with an inexhaustible whiskey bottle. Jones' house is shown in the background, but Jones himself, after traveling waist deep through the snow in the opposite direction from his home, finally becomes bewildered and leans against a tree, the expression on his face alternating between happiness and disgust. A friendly policeman appears and endeavors to start Jones off in the right direction; an argument follows, which ends with Jones knocking off the policeman's hat and pitching him head first into a neighboring snowdrift. Jones now dons the policeman's helmet, appropriates his club, then makes an attempt to arrest the worthy officer of the law. The picture finally ends by Jones being rolled in the snow."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279182</url></doc>
