<plot>When Frank &amp; Jesse are wronged by the huge international gold mining operation where they work, and then their father dies because of the mine, and they lose their houses to the mine, and then their wives leave them, they decide to slap some revenge on the face of this huge America conglomeration. Along with their two crazy cousins from Reno, they rob the modern day stage coach, the Wells Fargo armored car, of it fifteen million in gold bars as it crosses the Nevada desert. Chased and tracked down by the "dirty Harry of the Nevada outback," deputy John Lawson, the gang of modern day desperados are whittled down to the two brothers. In the end, the only loser ends up being the faceless corporate gold mine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617046</url></doc>
