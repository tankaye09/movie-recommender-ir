<plot>Laxmikant Kabadiya and his twin-sister, Prerna, started as mere beggars near Dadar Railway Station, and with the assistance of Vidyut Baba, they moved to collecting garbage, and recyclables, established their own recycling business, slowly acquired wealth and became multi-millionaires. Laxmikant went on to get married and sired two sons, Sameer and Ranjeet, who, in turn, went on to get married to Anju and Shruti. While Ranjeet has two daughters, Sanjana and Namrata, Sameer has one son, Pawan. Vidyut Baba, a Bi-sexual, is now their family Guru, and they have a trusted family servant named Ramu. The Kabadia family is now ready to launch it's first Public Offering, which will generate Crores of Rupees. The entire family is all set to enjoy this new-found wealth when they find out that while being intimate with a sexy, struggling actress, Kim, widower Laxmikant has passed away. The entire family know that this will ruin their future plans and decide to keep his death a secret. They threaten Kim with dire consequences and criminal charges, and let her flee. Unfortunately for them, Ramu finds out and starts to blackmail them collectively for jewelry and cash. The desperate family is all set to secretly cremate Laxmikant, but things get out of hand and they, after buying the dead body of a poor man, announce the death of Laxmikant's cousin. Amidst media frenzy, the Kabadias arrange for the public appearance of Laxmikant, followed quickly by another funeral, this time of an unknown Christian male, who they pass off as another family relative. Watch what happens when Ramu goes live on TV to announce the untimely passing away of a very much alive Vidyut Baba, throwing open a virtual Pandora's box. Amidst hilarious chaos, the family's lives are complicated even more when they find out to their shock that Laxmikant was leading a dual life and had sired a third son from another woman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085496</url></doc>
