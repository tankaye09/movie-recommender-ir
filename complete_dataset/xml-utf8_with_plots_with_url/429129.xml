<plot>Renowned science-fiction author Charlie Thomas writes peacefully in his wooded, upstate home. But when his Agent Trevor arrives uninvited at Charlie's home, the writer is flustered and infuriated with his agent, forcing Charlie to build a structure of total isolation. Charlie's new home is an astounding confine of modern architecture, completely devoid of electricity, furniture, or any phone line. And more shocking yet, Charlie's new home is an exact replica of a house that Charlie once developed in a story. When Trevor returns to the secluded estate, the eerie and confusing display of fiction come-to-life stuns the agent immensely; but it has driven Charlie to utter serenity. What happens inside Charlie's new home, however, is somewhat fantastic and totally insane.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429129</url></doc>
