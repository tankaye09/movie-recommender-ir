<plot>Nurse Julie Applegate's father left home when Julie was a young girl, singing 'I'm Alabama Bound' as he left. Years later, an injured stranger in a cowboy shirt is admitted to Julie's hospital badly injured in an 'accident'. Julie takes a special interest in the handsome stranger, having discovered that he's from Alabama USA. But when he comes round, the stranger is suffering from memory loss and can't satisfy Julie's deep-seated curiosity on all things Alabama. As the pleasant stranger struggles to regain his memory, he gradually realizes that he was on a mission involving bad guys (including himself), a suitcase full of money, and an angry 'Mr Big'... and he's got work to do!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?028504</url></doc>
