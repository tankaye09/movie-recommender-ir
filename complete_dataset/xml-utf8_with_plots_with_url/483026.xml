<plot>Searching for Norman: a grandson's journey presents the story of Kevin Gellerman, a man who sought to unravel the mystery of his grandfather's death during World War II. Kevin's journey begins humbly enough -- with a Post-ItÂ® Note providing few details obtained at Arlington National Cemetery. However, as Kevin continues to uncover the facts, he learns that a monument to his grandfather has been built outside a rural village in France. Kevin ends up experiencing much more than he ever imagined when he is invited to participate in an annual ceremony that commemorates his grandfather's heroism. Viewers follow Kevin on what he describes as "a journey of a lifetime."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483026</url></doc>
