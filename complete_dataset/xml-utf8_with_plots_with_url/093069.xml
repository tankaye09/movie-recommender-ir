<plot>This we believe to be the best as well as the most interesting subject of Boston's latest fad yet taken. The opening of this picture brings into view the beautiful Charles RIver, considered to be the most picturesque spot in the East. One of the features of this picture is the great number of canoes which are being skillfuly handled by the occupants of same. They approach in large numbers, and as they pass close to the camera it makes this picture a most striking one. The happy faces of the fair occupants can be plainly seen as they glide past, and this, of course, is bound to make it a bright and winning subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093069</url></doc>
