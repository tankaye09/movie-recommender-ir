<plot>Jack sees a film crew at work and is disgusted by their rowdiness. He sees Mary dressed in a demure Quaker costume and, not realizing she's an actress, apologizes to her on behalf of the rude film people. She goes along with the ruse, even taking him to meet her 'parents' who are also actors in the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?240824</url></doc>
