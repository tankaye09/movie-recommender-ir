<plot>Three gangsters (Richard Vega, Roger Spivey and Robert Wallace), who work for "Black" -a criminal organization-, are planning on killing their boss (Vincenzo de Paramo), a burnt-out spaghetti who has lived in New York most of his life, working for the Mob. Their work consists of intercepting cocaine and blanked money from drug dealers at the moment in which they're trading all the stuff. A big trade is taking place, and the three gangsters intend to get the snow, the money, and run away after having killed Vincenzo. But Vincenzo strikes first, and that big trade is actually a big trap in which they're supposed to be killed by their substitutes, a recently hired three-man gang. In the middle of this appear Mister Sandman - another "Black" employee, whose mission consists on getting money for the organization by selling the stolen cocaine, who is also about to be killed, and Bonnie Dimmick Vincenzo's girlfriend, who teams up in secret with Richard, Roger and Robert in order to outwit and kill de Paramo.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072464</url></doc>
