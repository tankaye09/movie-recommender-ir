<plot>A man dressed as a waiter brings a plate of food to a woman seated at a table in a restaurant. The woman tastes the food, indicates it lacks something and the waiter leaves to get it. He returns with a bottle of Tabasco sauce which the woman shakes vigorously over her food. After sampling the concoction, it is evident from her facial expression that she has made a terrible mistake, and the film ends with the waiter squirting seltzer water in her mouth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?051407</url></doc>
