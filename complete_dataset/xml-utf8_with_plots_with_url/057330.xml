<plot>"We are members of society," states 18-year-old Magda before a panorama of Vienna with the apartment buildings on the Donauinsel, also called Transdanubia, on the horizon. This complex is home to the daughters of immigrant parents whom Ruth Kaaserer and her camera accompanied through the urban space for six months. balance focuses on Ewa, Magda and Andrea, who talk about growing up, their friendship and their plans for independence in short scenes which show them walking through the apartment complex, along the Danube River and at various parks. Excerpts from these conversations are juxtaposed with clips in which the girls perform their own hip-hop numbers for the camera and shots of other teenagers roller-skating, playing baseball, strolling or talking; these scenes address the topic of how female subjects adapt to society, their private lives and public spaces.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057330</url></doc>
