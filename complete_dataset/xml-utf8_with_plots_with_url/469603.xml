<plot>This Technicolor short, with Sir Malcolm Sargent conducting the Royal Symphony Orchestra, was produced by Castleton Knight, to be shown as a companion piece to "A Queen's World Tour." It covers the highlights of Queen Elizabeth's Coronation Year, climaxing in her departure by plane on the first lap of the tour shown in the 84 minute feature documantary that followed. Shown are the Trooping of the Colours ceremony, the Royal Air Force Review, a pageant on the Thames River in the Queen's honor and other Coronation events, all accompanied by a musical score played by the orchestra.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469603</url></doc>
