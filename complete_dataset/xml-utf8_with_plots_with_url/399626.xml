<plot>A fragmentary description of the abandoned area of Lisbon's Luna Park in the period between its closing down and ultimate demolition. A set of long static takes, punctuated by small movements, depicts some of the precinct's features (sealed or half-dilapidated façades, partially dismantled attractions), retracing a route within the premises. Intended to force the focus of perception, the film explores the links between temporal experience and the visual and aural grasp of a specific place.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?399626</url></doc>
