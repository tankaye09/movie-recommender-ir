<plot>One of the most perilous performances in a circus ring is bareback riding, but you have to see this one to admit that the act is the most daring that has ever been attempted, in fact this is the only performer in the world who has ever accomplished the feat. We refer to Oscar Lowande, who turns a complete somersault from one horse to another running tandem. This artist is the champion of all fancy and trick riders.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059499</url></doc>
