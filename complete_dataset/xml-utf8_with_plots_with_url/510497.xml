<plot>Spin Cycle is a bizarre fantasy set in a hallucinatory Manhattan laundromat. It is about two men who end up in a struggle that questions what is fantasy and what is reality. Exquisitely shot in black and white 16mm by cinematographer Frank Linkoff, this surreal 16-minute film evokes a sensuous and disturbing feeling. The collision of these two highly delusional characters creates chaos in this abstract and highly interpretable film. One can find meditations on subjects that range from the male gaze and the nature of femininity to human perceptions of fantasy and reality,</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510497</url></doc>
