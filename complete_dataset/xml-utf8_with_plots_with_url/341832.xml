<plot>Geeta Malhotra (Shabana Azmi) gets married to a young man, Bhupinder (Farooq Shaikh) her mom (Rohini Hattangadi) and dad do not approve of. They are happy together and she soon expects a baby. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes and she loses her child. She is devastated and severely depressed about this loss. One day while travelling by the city bus service, she comes upon a small boy left behind inadvertently by his family, and she takes him home and treats like her own son. Her husband, though knowing that this is wrong, goes along with her, as this seems to help her situation. Eventually, the police and the boy's family catch her with Geeta and she is arrested and stands trial for abduction. The Court can come to either one decision: Incareration or confinement to an mental asylum. Which is it going to be for Geeta?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341832</url></doc>
