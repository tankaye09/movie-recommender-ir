<plot>Former Special Forces medic, Wayne Nichols made a promise to his friend and interpreter Babur and to himself, when he was in Afghanistan: he would return as a doctor and make a real difference. In Washington, DC Emma Bliss, a high profile attorney and wife of a US Senator wants only to make a name for herself while her husband is busy climbing the political ladder. When Babur and his wife arrive in the US expecting to meet Nichols and start a new life they find that the path to freedom isn't an easy one; even in the US. All of their lives are thrown together in ways they could have never imagined and they come to realize that there never is such a thing as a true stranger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517535</url></doc>
