<plot>Two friends start in Denver looking at American men who comb their hair over a bald spot. They talk to historians, sociologists, and a psychologist about the combover. They visit barbers, hair stylists, and a hairpiece maker. They talk to men about the whys and hows of their combover. Some are good sports. They go to Texas and hold a contest with a $200 prize for the best. They talk to the son of a man who patented and three-direction combover. They wait in a Texas caf√© for a local with a celebrated one. They try for interviews with Donald Trump and UN Ambassador Mohammed Aldouri, of Iraq. They talk to the people at the Hairclub. They ask if the combover is a dying style.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111451</url></doc>
