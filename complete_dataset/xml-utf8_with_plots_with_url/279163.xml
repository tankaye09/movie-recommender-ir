<plot>This picture shows Jones entertaining three young ladies after the theatre. They have a private room, and are evidently enjoying themselves very much. Jones sets up wine freely, and the party becomes hilarious. The girls dance in turn for Jones, each vieing the other in executing novel, and startling terpsichorean effects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279163</url></doc>
