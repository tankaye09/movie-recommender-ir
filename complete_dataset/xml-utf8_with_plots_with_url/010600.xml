<plot>A bulldog guards a chicken coop that a hungry fox wants to raid. To gain the friendship and trust of the bulldog, the fox shaves his tail and pretends to be a hard-luck terrier looking for a place to live. The bulldog instantly sees through the fox's ploy but acts as though he's fooled. He agrees to share his home with the fox. At night, the fox sneaks into the chicken coop to steal one of the hens. The dog disguises himself as a huge chicken, which the greedy fox takes, and when the bulldog reveals himself beneath the disguise, the fox bolts and runs to a highway, where he hitches a ride on a passing truck, not noticing that the truck belongs to a fox furrier company.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010600</url></doc>
