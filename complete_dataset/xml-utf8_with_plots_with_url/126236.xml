<plot>Daniel Finds His Walking Stick is a collage of memories from a man suffering from Alzheimer's. It is a funny and sad portrait of the plight of an aging lonely man in a changing world. His wife, Lydia, has been gone for 25 years and his son, Lester, for 15. However, these facts are mostly lost to Daniel as he lives in a fusion of his memories and current day. Culminating in his accounting of all the funerals he has attended and the revelation of a note left on his door, Daniel's predicament is heartbreaking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126236</url></doc>
