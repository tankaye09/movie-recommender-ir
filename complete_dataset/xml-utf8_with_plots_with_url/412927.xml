<plot>Trainee police officer Toni Stroud (Loughlin) has just gotten her first report card from her superiors; straight A's. But a fellow officer has something else in mind, and asks to stay at her home after his wife kicks him out. Thinking nothing of it, she allows him to sleep on her couch after a night shift. But while she's asleep in her room, he sneaks in &amp; violently rapes her. When the colleague-turned-rapist is accused of rape by someone else, she goes to her superiors about it. Instead of taking action against the rapist, they retaliate by firing her, and then close ranks around the rapist. Meanwhile Toni is subjected to relentless bullying from people she once called friends, and her home &amp; parents' business are subjected to vandalism. She has the rapist charged and files a lawsuit against her former bosses for illegal termination. Will she prevail...or will the rapist escape his punishment after being shielded by the department?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412927</url></doc>
