<plot>A hand-colored and digitally aged silent film about the difficult and catching life of Romani children in Nadisu Hododului, a small pre-industrial village in Romania. The title and the look of the film would suggest that it was shot by an oriental traveler with a silent camera. In the last scene of the film the archaic look transforms into a digital image that warns the spectator that these primitive conditions are a present day reality in the hearth of Europe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?526328</url></doc>
