<plot>A snow covered slope with narrow trail is seen in the foreground of this picture. In the distance, some figures are seen approaching. As they draw nearer we recognize a dog team and sledge loaded with supplies, and followed by miners loaded with tools and materials, trudging their way over the well run trail into the heart of the Klondike. This picture gives the observer some idea of the hardships of the miners in the Alaskan Gold Field.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420002</url></doc>
