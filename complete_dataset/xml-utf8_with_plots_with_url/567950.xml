<plot>College buddies Eric and Richard are dumped by their girlfriends on the same day and decide to go to a kegger party to drink away their sorrows. Richard poses the challenge that not only do they beat the lame frat guys at a game of beer pong, but also see who can 'score' with as many girls as possible all in one night.... Their game has consequences no one can imagine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567950</url></doc>
