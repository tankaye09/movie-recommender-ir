<plot>Wealthy businessman, Harkishan, lives in a palatial house, with his womanizing and alcoholic grandson, Prem. He would like Prem to get married, settle down, and look after the business, but Prem refuses to do so, unless and until he is permitted to wed his girlfriend, Rita. Harkishan reluctantly agrees and wants to set a date for the marriage. Before that could happen Harkishan's health fails and he suffers a heart attack. Fearing that he is not going to live long enough, he asks Prem to introduce him to his bride-to-be. Prem accordingly brings Rita home, where she is welcomed by everyone. Harkishan approves of her instantly, she begins to look after him, he starts to recover, and eventually ends up entrusting her with the keys to the household, as well as to the safe. What Harkishan does not know is that Rita is not who she claims to be, but is, in fact, a street florist named Kammo. Watch what happens when Kammo decides to run the lives of Harkishan and Prem on her own terms.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161915</url></doc>
