<plot>Tullio Kezich comments on the career of Ermanno Olmi, observing that Olmi never worked in Rome, was indifferent to large profits in film, and that his ability to improvise was based in part on his thorough knowledge of all aspects of movie making. A long interview with Olmi focuses on his making of "I Fidanzati" and Il Posto," in the early 1960s. Olmi credits Pasolini and Rossellini with inspiration to make film about his reality. He describes "I Fidanzati" as being about the changes industrialization brought to tradition, both in small towns in the North and to Sicily. The interview is inter cut with clips from the two films Olmi discusses. Dance, too, is an important subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385373</url></doc>
