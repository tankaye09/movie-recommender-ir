<plot>In Absentia is an experiment in storytelling. It focuses on a character (and storyteller) with an unreliable point of view. His view of reality is distorted, but he himself doesn't realize this until it is too late. You can't always believe the one telling the story, even when the storyteller believes the story to be true. The world portrayed is not always what is really happening. Each person's point of view builds a different picture of reality based upon "what we know," not what is really happening.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261385</url></doc>
