<plot>After a sixteen year ordeal a new breakthrough documentary has finally been completed. Tracing for the first time the entire origin, evolution and history of the forms that make up Urban Dance which the world now refers to as break dance or hip-hop dance. The film which is based on the Guzman-Sanchez study (which began in 1983) has evolved into a 144 minute feature documentary entitled Underground Dance Masters: Final History of a Forgotten Era and has become the definitive take on the some most important developments that have affected today's Pop Culture. Correcting an earlier 1996 version, the final new cut boldly uncovers the truth about urban dance and redefines the origins of a world-wide phenomenon. A dance pioneer and now an academically recognized Urban Dance Anthropologist, Writer and Director Thomas Guzman-Sanchez culls and mines the exciting foundations of these truly revolutionary American art forms that drew from a unique collective of dance artists and underground cultures as it has paved the way for music, films and dance performances that have become synonymous with youth culture worldwide. The film takes the viewer on a journey of discovery as it traces the origins, evolution, history and the uncovers the creators of the Urban Dance forms of Boogaloo, Locking, Popping, Zig-Zag, Roboting, Rocking and B'boying. With historic, never before seen footage stretching back to 1965, combined with interviews with the actual creators and innovators along with a special interview with Choreographer Kenny Ortega. The film uncovers not only the beginning of these dance forms but the lives of the multi-racial dance artists and how their creations have to spread the magic world-wide.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629744</url></doc>
