<plot>Not that the game even needs a storyline...but the task in Frogger's Adventures: Temple of the Frog is to collect stolen sacred elements that will save the swamp from a certain death. Each of the game's fifteen different levels and boss battles requires the same up/down/left/right hopping that made the original arcade design such simplistic fun. But instead of swerving to miss vehicles on a busy highway, your travels will take you through caverns, ancient ruins, and even a few underwater levels avoiding enemies and obstacles that'll make the Frogger croak if they nail him</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204756</url></doc>
