<plot>The basis of the documentary is a presentation of the forensic and historical research into the images of the prophet Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons). The documentary team researches a proposed photograph taken of Joseph Smith before he died. To some, they find the image to be authentic; to others it does not match what they are accustomed to seeing from paintings done of him. The documentary takes you through the history of the various paintings of Joseph Smith, forensic evidence discovered and applied to these various paintings, and some of the historical events that were used to determine the authenticity of the photography. This journey invites the audience to come to know Joseph Smith from new and unique perspective.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432133</url></doc>
