<plot>Phoebe, a young woman living in New York, arrives at the apartment of her lover, Rian, after a night out without him. After making love, they talk, skirting around the ambiguities of their relationship until Phoebe obliquely tells Rian what he means to her. Uncomfortable, Rian cannot truthfully return Phoebe's sentiments. Confronted with his differing expectations of her and the relationship, she leaves the room, isolating herself in the kitchen, until Rian comes after her. As Rian comes onto her, Phoebe hesitates, and in that hesitation she is confronted with the choice to end a liaison with someone who does not love her - or willfully close her eyes against the truth in favor of a seductive, beautiful illusion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431309</url></doc>
