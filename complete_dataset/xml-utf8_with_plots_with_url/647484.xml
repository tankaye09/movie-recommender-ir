<plot>Wargames is a movie licensed Real Time strategy game comparable to the likes of Command &amp; Conquer. The game is based on the 1980 movie of the same name, about a computer trying to take over the world. You have to command many different units, lead them into war against the computer and you get emails from characters from the movie. All the units are represented by robots. Wargames features a real time 3d isometric graphic and high resolution full motion videos in-between the missions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647484</url></doc>
