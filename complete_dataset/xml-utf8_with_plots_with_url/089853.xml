<plot>Jesus is a horse breeder, providing the federals and the revolutionists with horses during the revolution, trying his best to steer clear of politics of which he has little interest. Meanwhile Jesus' heart is set on two things; a wild stallion 'Prieto Azabache' and a beautiful singer named 'Genoveva Alarios'. He pursues both but after being rejected by Genoveva decides to settle for the horse as a companion. Later, he gets into trouble for supplying horses to both the revolutionists and the federals and has to face the prospect of execution. Yet little did he know that previously through an act of kindness, he had saved the life of young Pancho Villa, formerly known as Doreteo Arango, which in turn gave Villa the same opportunity to spare Jesus' life. They later become great friends and Villa permits Jesus to carry on breeding horses providing he also works for him temporarily as his spy. Villa secretly plans to pair together his two most loyal spies: Jesus and the other spy who turns out to be Genoveva. They get married and shortly after Genoveva becomes pregnant. But one tragic event leads to more anguish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089853</url></doc>
