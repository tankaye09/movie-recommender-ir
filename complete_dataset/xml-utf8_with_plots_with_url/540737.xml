<plot>Anne Parkson (Frances Gifford) feels neglected by her lawyer-husband Ted (George Murphy), so she falls in love with night-club owner Tony Arnello (John Hodiak), a shady character who is a client of her husband's. This being a MGM picture and MGM known to strive for General Audience ratings and avoid the dreaded Adult Audience tag, any affair that takes place is barely implied. Tony, a no-goodnik, kills Claire Lorrison (Joan Woodbury), but Anne's compact is found near the body. Arnello threatens her with exposure unless she keeps quiet, as she is the only one who knows he is guilty. This being an Arch Oboler film, it is also filled with lots of "stream of consciousness" techniques in which the audience is able to share the thoughts of the central character. Oboler is highly praised in some quarters for bringing this from his radio programs where, of course, it was needed to let the radio audience know what was going on. In films, it comes off as just somebody talking to themself. Gifford talks to herself a lot in this one, mainly about whether to commit suicide. Not in a MGM General Audience-rated movie you don't.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540737</url></doc>
