<plot>Charles wakes up early one morning, driven by a strange desire to pack his bags and get away for a few days. Once at the train station, he realizes he doesn't know where to go. This is unusual for him: he is a very organized man... He dozes on the train, a pain in his chest keeping him awake. As he walks through the town he basically selected at random, Charles stops abruptly in front of an old house; a strong feeling of deja vu overwhelms him. He spends the rest of the day spying on that house. The discovery awaiting will be beyond his understanding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113013</url></doc>
