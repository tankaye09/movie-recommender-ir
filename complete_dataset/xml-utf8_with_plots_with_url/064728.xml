<plot>Until recently, Paul Bellini was the most famous person from Timmins, Ontario, Canada. That is, until Shania Twain came along. The fastest selling female country artist in history, her meteoric rise to stardom quickly eclipsed Bellini's spotlight as Timmins' Emmy-nominated writer and "guy in the towel" on Kids In The Hall, and multiple Gemini award-winner for his writing on CBC's This Hour Has 22 Minutes. A budding recording artist as well, Bellini's Drive is the hilarious and often touching account of Paul Bellini's return to Timmins for Shania Twain's triumphant homecoming, where he hopes to personally express his admiration and respect. As Paul tries to use his "celebrity" status to obtain a meeting with Shania, we come to better understand his ambitious dreams, and the predominant social and environmental forces that helped shape them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064728</url></doc>
