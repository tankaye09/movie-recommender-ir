<plot>In an unnamed nation in an unspecified period of time, a new law which is intended give more peace to the people by strictly upholding morality only ends up justifying people to take matters into their own hands. New organizations who label themselves "the guardian of moral values" emerge and will easily attack somebody they consider immoral. Citizens of the country are divided into two groups: those that grow more violent and those who hope that the myth about the birth of a person who will lead the nation toward the light will soon come true. A police detective named Eros investigates the death of five men who were burnt alive by a mob of pedestrians after someone screamed 'thief!' at them at a bus station. While his superior orders him to lay off the "insoluble" case, Eros discovers there's a more sinister motive behind the killing than just a simple vigilantism. Meanwhile, a journalist named Janus is having the lowest time of his life. His wife divorces him and his boss fires him for a same reason. He' suffering from narcolepsy which makes him falls into a deep sleep every time he experiences a sudden emotional reaction such as anger, fear, or joy. After unsuccessfully trying to interview the wife of one of the deceased men, the woman leaves him a message which contains a dangerous secret which may become the cause of the killing. Not knowing the meaning of the message, Janus tells his friends about it. But everybody he talks to soon dies mysteriously. Janus is also pursued by some powerful people who knows about the value of the secret that Janus holds. Eros' investigation and Janus' dangerous knowledge soon lead the two into a labyrinth of conspiracies and murders which involves not only mortal forces as they unknowingly become major players of the making of the figure that the country has been waiting for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133098</url></doc>
