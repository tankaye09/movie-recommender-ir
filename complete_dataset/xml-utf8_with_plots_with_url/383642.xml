<plot>Deer season is here and Glen, an energetic pre-teen, is faced with the pressure to kill a deer in order to win his father's respect. Unsuccessful in the past, he is now ready to show his dad that he has what it takes to be a man. Confiding in his best friend Richard, a white-tail deer, Glen falls deeper into depression and despair. In a touching act of bravery, Richard offers to lay down his life for his best friend. Henceforth, the two surmise a plot in order to secure Glen's transition into manhood and end a relationship that lasted longer than either of them could have expected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383642</url></doc>
