<plot>Kelly Mantle, West Hollywood cross dresser, nephew of baseball legend Mickey Mantle, and the son of a retired army colonel, is panicking. In a few short hours his ultra conservative parents, who don't know their son his gay, will arrive at the home Kelly shares with his buff, Venezuelan boyfriend. Not yet ready to confront them about his sexual orientation, Kelly desperately needs a "straight makeover"... and FAST! This is a task suited for only one team of experts, "The Straight 6". With specialties that include interior demolition, cheap chicks and cologne, snacks, threads, and guns and ammo, the well intentioned, yet utterly tasteless makeover squad tears through Kelly's apartment and life, leaving a wake of straightness everywhere. The once manicured, ultra neat Kelly quickly finds himself with a mullet haircut, an apartment unfit for a slob, and a prop girlfriend who makes Howard Stern's guests look virginal. When Kelly's parents arrive to confront the carnage left by The Straight 6, they are horrified. It is then that the real hilarity ensues!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517039</url></doc>
