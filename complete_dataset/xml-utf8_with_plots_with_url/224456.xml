<plot>The scene opens in an artist's studio where the unfinished statue of William Tell stands upon a pedestal. A clown appears and sticks a clay arm and clay head on the statue, thus completing it. He places a large brick on top of the head to make it stick. When he turns his back the statue turns into a living representation of William Tell, and seizing the brick from the top of his head, hits the clown a heavy blow upon the back. After some very strange happenings, the mysterious William Tell finally vanishes in a cloud of smoke, and the clown jumps up from the floor and makes his exit in a very ludicrous manner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224456</url></doc>
