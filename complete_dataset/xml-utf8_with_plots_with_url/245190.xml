<plot>Behind a large rock, upon a beautiful beach, Hooligan sits at ease devouring his mid-day meal. Along the beach comes a natty young dude dressed in the very latest style, white flannels, straw hat, high collar and fancy cane. He pauses on the far side of the rock, and, seeing no one in sight, proceeds to undress and go in for a swim. By this time Hooligan is "on," and has been watching the disrobing with interest. As soon as the unfortunate dude enters the water, Hooligan immediately commences to annex the dude's clothes, leaving in their place his own horrible rags. He then saunters along the beach, blowing kisses to the frantic young man, who has just discovered his loss. The dude, having nothing else to wear, is obliged to put on Hooligan's cast off rags, and he had just done this when he is chased away by a colored girl from one of the neighboring cottages, who mistakes him for a tramp. The film ends with an exicitng fight in the water between Hooligan, the dude and the servant girl, in which the latter gets very much the best of it. A screaming laugh from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245190</url></doc>
