<plot>In this game you're allowed to play the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Persians, the Celts, the Hindus or the Chinese, and your goal is to grow an Empire. To achieve it you will have to build cities, military units, wonders and research science. Somewhat very similar to the "Civilization" series, its major difference is that you will live only in the Ancient times.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?587063</url></doc>
