<plot>David is in love with Amber. She's everything he's ever wanted, except, she doesn't know he exists. After several failed attempts to say hello, he discovers she has a boy friend. Lost in despair, a custodian at the mall they both work at offers his advice. Love is free, it's from his heart, and he's got nothing to lose. With new found reasoning and a positive attitude, David decides to give it one more try. But when he discovers that Amber was in a fatal accident the previous day, he must learn to live with this love he's never shared, and the lesson of a life time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282487</url></doc>
