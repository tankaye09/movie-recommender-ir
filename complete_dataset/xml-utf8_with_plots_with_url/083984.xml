<plot>Broken Treaty at Battle Mountain has found its place as a classic motion picture that set the stage for the Western Shoshone Indians to rally forces for their battle cry "Mother Earth is not for sale!" Broken treaty portrays the Shoshones in their initial organizing efforts as they attempt to stop the government from tearing down thousands of acres of their sacred pinion trees. Broken Treaty offers a fascinating portrait of traditional Native American life and documents dramatic behind-the-scenes confrontations between Indians and US Government officials. Broken Treaty is a true story, filmed as it happened, of a broken treaty and a Native Peoples' resistance in America today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083984</url></doc>
