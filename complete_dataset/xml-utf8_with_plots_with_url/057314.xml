<plot>On a misty morning, an old bus leaves Batum to go to Istanbul. As the bus stops at various places on the way, Russian women of all ages and professions, each with a unique tale, board. In this bus full of women, there are three Turkish men. Three brothers who have come together after many years to carry their father's last wish... The eldest, Necati Bey (Ugur Yucel) views life through his father's eyes, Hasan (Cem Davran) is a sailor, the conqueror of open seas and women's hearts. The youngest, Mehmet (Ozan Guven) grew up with their mother in Germany and has much to learn about his brothers, life, and love. All these different characters and their outlooks on life intertwine. Passions flare and preconceptions are shattered as the disparate collection of passengers embark, at the same time, on a personal journey of discovery. A chain of irreversible events lead to heartbreak, tragedy, and enlightenment. It is a journey on a bus full of joy, sadness, love, and life itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057314</url></doc>
