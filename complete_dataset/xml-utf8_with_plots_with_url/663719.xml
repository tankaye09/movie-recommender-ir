<plot>Two childhood friends grow up to be on the opposite sides of law, one an Additional Police Commissioner, Mahendra Ashwini Kumar (Mukesh Khanna), and the other a crime lord, Raj Pratap Singhal (Kabir Bedi). An associate of Singhal kills the son of Mahendra, and his other son, Rajesh (Feroz Khan), also a police officer, swears to avenge the death. Mahendra's deceased son leaves behind a widow, Kaushalya (Neena Gupta) and a daughter, Meghna (Manisha Koirala). On a chance meeting, Meghna meets with Vicky Malhotra (Vicky Arora), and eventually both in love with each other. The Kumars are introduced to Vicky, and they approve of him. Mahendra is then promoted as the Commissioner of Police, and is subsequently killed by another associate of Singhal. With the police closing in on Singhal, he decides to re-locate to Dubai, U.A.E. with his wife (Maya Alagh), son (Sanjay Dutt), daughter-in-law Anu (Nagma), and he arranges the abduction of Meghna to ensure his safety from Rajesh's wrath. It is than Meghna comes to know that Vicky is really the other son of Singhal, and who now has started showing his true colours.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663719</url></doc>
