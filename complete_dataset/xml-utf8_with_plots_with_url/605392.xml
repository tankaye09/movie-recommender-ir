<plot>Barry Manton is a rich heir who is constantly undermined by his father, who sees him as a gadabout. He even goes to the extent of paying his girlfriend to leave him. It seems he must remain a bachelor if he is to receive his inheritance. He meets Lola, a beautiful and thoughtful woman who enriches his life and makes him think about his actions. They soon marry. Meanwhile, Barry's father feels remorse for banishing his son, and invites him back into his life. Lola is fearful of meeting Barry's father for the first time, and convinced that Barry will not get his rightful inheritance, selflessly leaves him. Years later, they meet again in a hospital where Lola is a nurse - in order to support Peter, the child Barry never knew they had.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?605392</url></doc>
