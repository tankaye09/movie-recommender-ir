<plot>This short lived game show saw Roy Slaven and HG Nelson as the genial hosts of a Jeopardy-like game show. Three contestants competed against each other by choosing a quaint Australian topic from the board, to which an amount of money would be designated. The questions were often crude and distinctively Australian, and the leading contestant would have a chance to win $5000 of Roy and HG's money in a best of 10 questions round against either Roy or HG. $5000? Thanks very much!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657751</url></doc>
