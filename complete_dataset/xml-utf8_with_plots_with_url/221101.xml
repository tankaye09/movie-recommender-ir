<plot>Grace Before Meals is a 13 x 30 weekly cooking show hosted by Fr. Leo Patalinghug, a former competitive break dancer, four-time Tae Kwon Do champion, singer, teacher, world traveler, priest and one heck of a cook. And Fr. Leo's got a recipe for getting to the heart of things - but Grace Before Meals is more than just a cooking show. Fr. Leo draws on his colorful background, humor and faith to strengthen families and individuals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221101</url></doc>
