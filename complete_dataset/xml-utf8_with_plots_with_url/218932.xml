<plot>You may wonder about these people who meticulously sweep the drains in front of goldsmith's and shops that sell the precious metal/ornaments. They are the gold hunters, at their work day in and day out trying to distill gold from the dirt in front of the shops. Looking at them, you will see that they have not hit it big, but it is a profession and not all are permitted to do it. This film tries to document these people at work. The hunt for gold has become an addiction to them. While filming, we felt as if we do not exist.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218932</url></doc>
