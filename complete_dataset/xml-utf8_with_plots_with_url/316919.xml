<plot>This movie recounts the real story of Graziella Campagna, a Sicilian 17 yr old girl killed by the mafia, and of their relatives' battle to obtain justice. Graziella Campagna worked in a laundry. One day a customer forgot his notebook in a cloth. She found it and handed it over to her supervisor, who gave it back to the customer. This was Graziella's death sentence. The customer, in fact, was not the engineer Toni Cannata, as he said, but actually mafia boss Gerlando Alberti. Fearing that she could have learnt the truth and also the names of his accomplices, the mafioso let torture and kill her. The movie recounts her story and the story of the following investigations and trials. The participation of Piero Campagna, Graziella's brother and policeman, in the investigations will contribute to uncover a network of connivances and sidetrackings even at institutional levels.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?316919</url></doc>
