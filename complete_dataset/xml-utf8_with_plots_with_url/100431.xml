<plot>It was a dance - hot, sensual, and raw - set to a rhythm no one had heard before, born in a club just outside Myrtle Beach, South Carolina called CHARLIE'S PLACE. In the summer of 1950, CHARLIE FITZGERALD was a black club owner in a white world, but he lived life on his own terms. HARRY DRIVER was a young white grifter whose life had become a series of false starts and desperate cons. But when Harry walked into Charlie's club, he was gripped by a passion that would change his life. This is the story of a real place where the line between black and white dissolved in the raw sensuality and irresistible beat of a new sound called Rhythm and Blues - a fusion that ignited a generational firestorm of greed, prejudice, and murder that would echo across the nation. Their world - and ours - would never be the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100431</url></doc>
