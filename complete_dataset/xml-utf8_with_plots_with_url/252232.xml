<plot>Four Seattle roommates and two girlfriends find themselves at odds with each other. This time someone has taken matters into their own hands and has killed the main character in the first minute of the film. Robin Mills is murdered the moment she opens the door. Her ghost haunts the house in an attempt the find some peace. Filmed entirely from Robin's point of view, we are given a unique perspective from which to learn about the cast of characters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252232</url></doc>
