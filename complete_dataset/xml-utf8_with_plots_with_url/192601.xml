<plot>Summer 1870 : Baroness Clotilda dei Lucanigro and her cousin Gesualda are in church in their small Napolitan village. Outside the church a bunch of beggars can be found. A bouncing football crosses the frame. Spectator was cheated on : they just discovered the first scenes of a film being shot for the Belgian Television. The two ladies stop their acting. The director shouts « cut ! » Certain is a tension on the shooting : one of the actors (Gaël) hasn't yet arrived in Italy, and the planning may have to be reconsidered. Also the film is being shot in Piedmont with a Napolitan background, which historically is a non-sense and villagers don't approve. Eric, the actor impersonating a priest, has a crush on Paolo, a young Italian boy who is always around with his girlfriend. Little by little, Eric will seduce Paolo and open his mind to his real himself. But Gaël won't come, and the films must stop : everybody is to go back to Brussels. Paolo stays in his village, but his life has changed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192601</url></doc>
