<plot>It is nearly Christmas when two recently orphaned children have to choose with which of their relatives they will live - eccentric, stingy Aunt Edwina , who only wants them for their trust fund, or kindly Uncle Robert who wants to genuinely welcome them into his family. It's an amusing and heart-warming story as Edwina pretends to adore the children in order to trick them into coming to live with her. But on Christmas morning, both Edwina and Robert have surprises in store for them when the children make their decision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134598</url></doc>
