<plot>This film skillfully incorporates rare archival footage shot in 1937 by an American born in Gombin (75 miles northwest of Warsaw) with contemporary scenes to tell the story of 50 children of Holocaust survivors who return to their parents' village in Poland. They make friends, unexpectedly, with some of their parents' former neighbors and together they pay homage to their ancestors in this town where Jews and Christians lived together for centuries. We join them at the rededication of the Jewish cemetery, restoring tombstones desecrated and used as road paving; at the placement of a monument to the Jewish victims at Chelmno, the first extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland; and at the Konin slave labor camp's mass grave, where the filmmaker's grandfather is buried. This moving film makes a strong statement about the continuity of life and the need of subsequent generations to remember.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055282</url></doc>
