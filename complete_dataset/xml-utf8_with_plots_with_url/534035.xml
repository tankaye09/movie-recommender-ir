<plot>A woman named Ruby is killed and her body is thrown off of the third floor of a building (4th floor in North America). The police are called in to investigate, and they are assisted by Anil, who was a friend of Ruby. The prime suspect in Anil's eye is Ramesh, who has been lying about his alibi, and also about his relationship with Ruby. But the police have a clue - a button from an overcoat, a button that is worth Rs.250, and it is more than likely that this coat belongs to the killer, who is very wealthy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?534035</url></doc>
