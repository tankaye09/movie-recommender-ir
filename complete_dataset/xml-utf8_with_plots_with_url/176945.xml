<plot>Jenny holds her head, trying to make the talking stop. Identifying reality was never her strong suit...her own mind, the doctor's mind - who's in their right mind? She's found herself in a state mental institution - a system that questions her very sanity, and expects her to do the same. For quite some time she's coped with her affliction, conquering it. But accidents happen, as they always do. Jenny believes they are anything but accidents, and she knows who is responsible. However, she has a difficult time convincing anyone to believe what she had seen and heard is the truth. Jenny confides in her close friend Alex. At first he thinks she is nuts. But after a confrontation with the alleged suspect Alex is forced to admit that something is amiss and together they vow to stop the rampage of accidents. Jenny and Alex come face to face with their nemesis. In a final twist, Jenny is apprehended by the hospital staff and suspected of causing the accidents herself. We are left questioning to what extent Jenny is mentally ill. And does that necessarily make her wrong?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176945</url></doc>
