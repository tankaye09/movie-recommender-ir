<plot>Little Willie is bringing a huge firecracker in his cart, which he stands on end and then lights the fuse. He retires to a safe distance and watches with painful suspense the slowest of slowly burning fuses. Feeling sure that the fuse is out he approaches for a closer examination, when -- as usual -- a cloud of smoke, which afterwards clears away, shows Little Willie receiving his reward in that place where all good boys go in stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338607</url></doc>
