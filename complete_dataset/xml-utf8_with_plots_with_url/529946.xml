<plot>In a world of automobiles, can one woman on a yellow bike make a difference? Perhaps not. But maybe a fleet of bikes might create a new model for sustainable transportation. Toronto's Bike Share Program is at a crossroads. Internationally recognized, it cannot maintain funding for its yellow bike program without stepping on a new path. Maogosha Pyjor is the Manager of Bike Share. Now that the program is canceled, she is searching for models that can work for the challenges faced in North America. Maogosha looks for bikes and finds visionaries in Europe, North America, Columbia and China. Models for bike loaning are many and have different purposes. Corporate, political and community leaders share their lessons and thoughts on how the successes and failures of their system. But can Maogosha find a model that her community needs: accessible use of bicycles for everyone?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529946</url></doc>
