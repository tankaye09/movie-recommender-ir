<plot>Outside a party, a minor scuffle turns sour resulting in violence. With blood on his hands and clothes, Debitus founds himself in a surreal and unfamiliar dark place and is unable to regain entrance through the door from where he came, until a voice out of the dark offers him a well to cleanse himself. However, operating the well to draw the water also opens a gate from which the diabolical voice originates. Debitus must decide it he takes the risk to free whatever is behind that gate by getting the water from the well to clean himself in order to get back to the party.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044143</url></doc>
