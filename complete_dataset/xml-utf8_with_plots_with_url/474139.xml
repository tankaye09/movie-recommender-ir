<plot>What if you got to heaven and nobody you loved was there? Saint Zen is the story of Lance Kelley, a young American living a Dionysian nightmare. Orphaned and addicted to heroin, catharsis is forced upon our anti-hero to decide his providence or his doom. Will rational thought unravel the mystery of his existence or will faith alone decide when he finds himself lost in Heaven. Defenselessly he wrestles the ideologies of his childhood and searches for the courage to believe he is captain of his own fate. Aristotle, Nietzsche, Arthur Miller, none of them have been to heaven and back - so what do they know?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474139</url></doc>
