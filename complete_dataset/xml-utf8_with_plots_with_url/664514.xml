<plot>A defiant, headstrong husband, Jeff Yeardley, is fired from his comfortable job at a Web Agency after being accused of sexually harassing a coworker. Upon arriving home, he finds his wife of nine years, Susan, moving out with their five-year-old son, Chase. Shortly thereafter she files for a legal separation. Almost overnight, Jeff's seemingly comfortable life goes from unremarkable to catastrophic. With the stigma of sexual deviancy looming over him, Jeff finds it impossible to find employment, which proves to further hinder his visitation rights to his son. After his rebellious tongue gets him into hot water with a social worker, Jeff seeks the help of his best friend who offers him employment. When two female coworkers make advances at Jeff, he's lead on a journey of moral discovery and quickly learns he is in well over his head and finds his already strained relationship with his family is threatened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664514</url></doc>
