<plot>Sunder Singh lives with his wife, Lajwanti, and three sons, Bheema, Kishan, and Vijay, in a small town in India. His two elder sons are slackers and up to mischief and wrestling. They find they can better their lives if they buy a tractor to till the land. Lajwanti comes up with jewelery and the brothers recover the rest of the money on hold with Lala Bhagwandas, and set forth to buy a tractor. They re-locate to the city and team up with their police inspector brother Vijay. Watch as hilarious events unfold that will encompass the trio in crime, romance, and jail-time, as they try to diligently fulfill their parents' wishes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250144</url></doc>
