<plot>Kathleen Shaughnessy, Kat, a quirky, thirty three year old, Irish Catholic, single woman who after leaving her fianc√© at the proverbial alter, is forced to move back with her parents and live in their attic in Bronxville , NY. She is looking for love, work and any way to get out of 54 Rosedale Ave. Kat, terrified of funerals and the cause of every inane disaster at every family function, is named by Kat's mother's dying cousin, Margie, to give the eulogy at her funeral assuring a huge turnout; every good Irish Catholic's dream!
