<plot>This hilarious dramedy revolves around three sisters and their mother, who are caught up in the system of receiving welfare checks to support themselves and their families. Joyce, the older sister wakes up, and says enough is enough. She knows that her grandmother, mother, her two sisters, and herself are still on welfare. Joyce tells her two sisters that they have to break the family cycle of dependence on welfare checks to support themselves. 'Because of their little girls, we got to show them a better way of life.' They respond to her with disdain. 'Girl, sound like are talking about an eight to five, like a j-o-b. Give up free money? Hell naw, girl you done lost your damn mind.' Joyce's mother and sisters are caught by their social worker misusing their welfare money. Instead of using their money on them and their children, they spent the money on their no good boy friends. As a result, they lose their section eight (A low housing program funded by the government). With no place to go and Joyce feeling sorry for them, against her better judgement, she allows them to move in with her. Big Mistake! All hell breaks out. Mamma Lottie (Mother) thinks she is still a teenager. Drinks, smokes weed, and loves her some young handsome man. When the love making is over, she writes them a nice fat check. But there's one problem, she doesn't have a dime in her account.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650246</url></doc>
