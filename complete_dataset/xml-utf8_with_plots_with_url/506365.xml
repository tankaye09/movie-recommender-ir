<plot>SOME THINGS ARE REALLY SIMPLE is a claustrophobic 10-minute film about a young father who takes his identity from his hobby: free-diving which is swimming underwater as long as possible without an air supply. The film deals with the simple proceedings one has to go through in terminating a modern marriage. Is it all so simple? On homecoming he is confronted by a strange man, Mike, cooking for his wife and child. He finds his place in his house and his family taken. Clearly, Wout was on the verge of breaking with his family but this brings things into a frightening proximity. Considering there is a child at stake, the proper thing to do is to act low key. The situation seems discouraging and frustrating but when Mike asks whether Wout would be staying for dinner he replies: 'What's for dinner?'. A story about the bankruptcy of the modern relationship unfolds. A story about our relativistic times wherein emotions tend to be suppressed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506365</url></doc>
