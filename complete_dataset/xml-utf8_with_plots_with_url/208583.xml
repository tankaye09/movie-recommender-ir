<plot>In a golden field a single red door sits, calling for its creator to step through its frame. The creator is 15 year-old Miles Swenson, a diminutive, frustrated floppy haired kid who knows as much about life as he does about painting. Ridiculed by his stepmother, infatuated with his beautiful stepsister, and obsessed over the loss of his father, Miles uses watercolors to paint himself the perfect world. Soon, Miles finds himself in a vibrant world where his desires are met, and his regrets are reversed. However, in his absence from "reality" someone has stopped into his shoes, and now Miles is about to find out that perfection comes at a cost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208583</url></doc>
