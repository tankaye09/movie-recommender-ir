<plot>A new fight game has taken the sporting world by storm. CAGED FOR LIFE takes you inside the world of mixed-martial-arts cage fighting, going beyond the cage and into the lives of a legendary promoter and four unique talents as they prepare themselves for battle. Charles "Krazy Horse" Bennett, a convicted felon, looks for a way out through the cage. Joey Villasenor, an aging veteran has one last shot at glory. Paul Daley, a brash fighter from the UK, gives his all in hopes of seeing his name in lights. Gina Carrano, a stunning beauty, also happens to be the best female cage fighter in the country. CAGED FOR LIFE follows each of these stories as they seek their dreams and enter the cage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090440</url></doc>
