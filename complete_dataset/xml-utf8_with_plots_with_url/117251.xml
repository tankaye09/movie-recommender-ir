<plot>Covered Girls is a twenty minute documentary that explores the experience of certain Muslim-American teenage girls living in post-September 11th New York. The film documents the daily experiences of Muslim-American teenage girls who contradict the often stereotypical portrayal Muslims receive on the evening news. Kiren coaches her high-school basketball team; Amnah has a black belt in karate, and Tavasha is cutting a CD of original rap songs. The film shows these girls engaging in these and other activities. All of the girls wear the traditional hijab, or head scarf, and all of them are typical teenagers suddenly caught in a tug-of-war between religious extremism and the American dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117251</url></doc>
