<plot>An ex-boxer Baldev Choudhary has had a stain in his boxing career. He wanted to wash it with his son Angad's success, but times were hard and a financial crunch kept him from achieving this dream. Though Angad pulled through fine, Baldev never forgot who ruined his chance. An opportunity strikes Baldev in the form of a T.V. Show. He trains a local boy to get into this media hyped boxing show, but is ditched for a better coach at the last minute. Baldev's younger son Karan has just launched his first music album. Realizing his father is in a crises, he gives up his dream of a musical career to get into the game of boxing. Karan works hard and wins all through thinking that his victory will bring the two pillars of his family together. After winning within the nation, he wins all over the world. The final match is with the current world heavy champion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043446</url></doc>
