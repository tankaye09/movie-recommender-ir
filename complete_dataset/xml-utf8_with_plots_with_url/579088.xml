<plot>In this revival of the 1956 Jan Murray-hosted quiz show, two(2) female contestants are given separate opportunities to choose one(1) of 30 boxes (Surprise Packages) onstage. Before each segment, three females are selected from the studio audience from these 10 contestants to open special boxes onstage. Two(2) are empty, but the woman contestant choosing the one with a pop-up flower boquet is given an opportunity to select a box. Each box contains a cash amount {Secret Packet} (ranging from $500 to $2,000) and an unknown item. That unknown could be a prize (a car, trip, jewelry, furniture, fur, etc.), a "klunk" (a worthless, nonsense prize) or the checks are ranging from $5000 to $25,000. The contestant can either choose to keep the cash or trade it for the contents of the box. Before the contents of the box are revealed, a series of skits are performed to make the contestant believe she chose a klunk. At the end of each show, Emile Autouri announces the box containing the $25,000 check.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579088</url></doc>
