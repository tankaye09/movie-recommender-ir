<plot>In Florida, a starving Gabby Gator is fishing in the swamp for his dinner. He only succeeds in catching a news magazine which has an article about movie star, Woody Woodpecker who says, "Southern cooking is my favorite!" The crafty gator lures the woodpecker to his shack with a letter promising him a luxurious feast. As it turns out, the luxurious feast turns out to be HIM! He discovers the scheme and angrily leaves but the gator fools him into thinking a hurricane is approaching and encourages him to take shelter... in his barbecue pit! Fearing for his life, Woody realizes, "I gotta keep this cat groovy or I'll wind up in the gravy!" Woody tells the gator he really isn't much of a meal but he can make him a nicy juicy "swamp steak"... which turns out to be Gabby's tail. After biting into the "Swamp steak", Gabby leaps in pain and lands, getting stuck in a pot which Woody exclaims to be "Potted swamp steak"!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660574</url></doc>
