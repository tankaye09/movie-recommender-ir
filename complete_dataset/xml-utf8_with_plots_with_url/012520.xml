<plot>Aunt Amelia is seen seated at her spinning wheel when two bad boys of the village sneak in and use their blowpipes with telling effect on the old lady's face. She fails to find the boys, however, and again seats herself at the wheel, when one of the boys strikes her on the head with a large hammer from the window where she is seated. The old lady's blood is now at boiling point, and she charges on the boys who scamper out of her way. Leaning out of the window to catch one she loses her balance, and were it not for her hoopskirts, she would have fallen to the ground. She is stuck in the window, however, and presents a spectacle that will cause roars of laughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012520</url></doc>
