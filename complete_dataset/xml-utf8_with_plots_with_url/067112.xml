<plot>This award-winning documentary explores the lives of young Asian Americans raised in the U.S. and examines the difficulties they must overcome in establishing their cultural identities. Six young Asian Americans, mostly Korean Americans and all children of immigrants, are featured. They describe the significant cultural differences between them and their more traditional parents, who criticize them as being "Americanized" and lacking interest in their Asian cultural heritage. Yet they also encounter major conflicts within the mainstream culture, where they are commonly viewed as "exotic" and alien, complimented when they speak fluent English, and often asked when they are "returning home."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067112</url></doc>
