<plot>Poet Saul Williams once said "My sound system is louder than your belief system" This statement is true to a lot of african-american youths when it comes to Hip-Hop. Hip-Hop has given a voice to many who have felt isolated by poverty and despair. It has become a vehicle for some to overcome financial hardship and therapy to cope with inaccuracies of today's society.

My partner and I went out to explore the effects that southern Hip-Hop artist have on the younger generation; Interviewing a cross section of people asking them their thoughts and feelings about the power of Hip-Hop today.
