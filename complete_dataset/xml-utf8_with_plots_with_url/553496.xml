<plot>What is the nature of love? A sassy, brassy bird lands on a tree limb and moons a cat sitting there peacefully. The cat ignores the bird at first, but it continues its loud and coarse assault. The cat tries force: hitting, stomping, torching, and nuking the bird. Each time, the bird returns, thrusting its bare bottom in the cat's face. Another attempt at ignoring the bird reduces it first to tears then to illness. The cat saves it. Has the cat had a change of heart, or does it just enjoy inflicting pain? Is the bird expressing love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553496</url></doc>
