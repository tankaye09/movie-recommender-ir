<plot>In a suburb of Sydney, a single mom drops her car and her daughter off at the garage where the child's dad, Brian, is a mechanic. Mom's chafed because Brian fixed the car recently, but it's hobbled with the same clutch problem. She tells' Brian she's leaving the girl, Rosie, who's about 6 years old and dressed in a winged-fairy costume, with him until the job's done. He doesn't want Rosie around, but mom leaves and Rosie stays. Over the next few days, thanks to an 18-mm spanner, a pair of child's overalls, a large pair of wings, and Brian's proclivity to swear, dad engages a few parenting gears and gets traction with Rosie. Mom returns for the car; what will she find?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109422</url></doc>
