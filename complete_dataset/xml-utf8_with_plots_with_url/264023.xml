<plot>This children's game show was set in a talking lift called Sam, and saw 3 child contestants play Crystal Maze style games to earn levels, to make their way up the skyscraper to the Penthouse, where they could play for the main prize. Failing a game led to the contestant(s) being dropped down the laundry chute to the basement, where the remaining contestants had to get them out before they could continue their 'quest' or being gunged from the magic stick 'o gunge! Games included amongst others, the Victorian Headmaster, a ghost who conducted a 19th Century class, with questions where the contestants give the answer to the question before. Also, a chess-like game of cat and mouse against the 'Dark Knight' and another where contestants were 'shrunk' and put in a giant kitchen, swimming around in the soup bowl, fishing out alphabet-spaghetti letters to make words.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264023</url></doc>
