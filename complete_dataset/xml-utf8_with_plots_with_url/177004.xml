<plot>Norman Breckter is a lonely mailman stuck in the routine he's established for himself since high school. His days consist of walking the same mail route he has for years, talking to the same people he has for years, and then returning home only to his goldfish. He spends his nights meticulously drawing maps of back roads throughout the country, yet he has never traveled far out of town. This routine is interrupted when Norman stumbles upon a letter addressed to his favorite customer. He makes the decision to take the letter home and open it, throwing his normal routine out in the process. This single act turns Norman's life upside down, ultimately leaving him with a much larger decision to make.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?177004</url></doc>
