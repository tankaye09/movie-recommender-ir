<plot>This documentary is rated "R" (for rabbits). The film takes a look at the most misunderstood pet of them all, the domestic rabbit, and the people who love them. It also delves into how we treat our pets, by enforcing existing animal rights laws, and taking responsibility as a pet owner, because we can't always trust the well meaning pet store workers, as we see in the film. Some guerrilla style film-making, animations, and the bunny crusaders make this documentary a sobering comedy, you'll laugh, cry, and hopefully learn something new.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?179983</url></doc>
