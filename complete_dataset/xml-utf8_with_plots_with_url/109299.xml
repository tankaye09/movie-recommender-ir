<plot>Club Q was San Francisco's legendary, once-a-month dance party for lesbian women and their friends. Held on the first Friday of every month, Q attracted over 1,000 lesbian women of all colors, ages, sizes and backgrounds, to dance, sweat and celebrate inside the pulsating beat of high-energy dance music. Q was a one-of-a-kind phenomenon for two reasons: First, because of the sheer number and diversity of lesbian women who attended. And second, because of its longevity - the club lasted for 15 years! Q's ability to maintain not only its diverse clientele, but also its vitality in San Francisco's ever-changing club scene made it a cultural and historical marvel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109299</url></doc>
