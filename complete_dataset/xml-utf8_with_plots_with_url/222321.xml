<plot>Scene taken at the annual review of the German army. A great body of German Cuirassiers are seen in the opening of the picture at a distance of about half a mile, appearing very small upon the screen. They charge directly at the camera, presenting a thrilling and most spectacular appearance as they gradually grow to life size. The horses gallop at full speed and great clouds of dust float away in their rear. This is the finest display of German cavalry ever secured.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222321</url></doc>
