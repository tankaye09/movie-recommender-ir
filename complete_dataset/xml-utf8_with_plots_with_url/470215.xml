<plot>Ruins of the Reich, part 2, The Glory Years focuses on the Reichs Party grounds in Nuremberg. It was here on the former grounds of the Nazi party rallies that some of the largest ruins of the Third Reich still exists. Albert Speer's monumental grandstands on the Zeppelin field along with Ludwig Ruff's gigantic Congress hall remain as graphic testimony to the enormity of these grand annual events. The vast rally area also includes the former Hitler Youth stadium, the war memorial, the SS compound and a great granite road that stretched more than a mile long. The odyssey continues with a visit to the former rally site at the Konigsplatz site of the Munich conference. Other locations include Hermann Goring's palatial estate known as Karin Hall, His air force headquarters in Berlin, the former Nazi propaganda ministry and Hitler's new Reich's Chancellery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470215</url></doc>
