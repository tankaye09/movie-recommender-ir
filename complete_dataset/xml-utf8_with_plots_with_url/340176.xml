<plot>Nathan's lack of motivation and self-indulgent behavior has finally caught up with him. With nowhere else to stay, he's been house-sitting for his friend Terry while he's away on business, who left him with the task of awaiting a certain delivery. He spends his time distracting himself from reality any way he can, all the while dreaming of the possibilities of the outside world. Through some kind of divine intervention, he soon finds himself locked out of the house. With Terry gone until the next week, he tries hopelessly to find a way back in. He's now forced to confront the obviousness he's been trying to ignore: take this opportunity to escape his listless existence, or let it take a turn for the worst.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340176</url></doc>
