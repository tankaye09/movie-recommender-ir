<plot>Sandeep Rai (Raj Babbar) is a wealthy, yet kind-hearted young man. During his childhood he was separated from brother, Sonu (Aasif). Sonu has now grown up and calls himself Vicki. Vicki loves Hema (Kimi Katkar), who is the daughter of a poor bus driver, John D'Souza (Pran). John lives with his wife, Mary D'Souza (Shammi), four unmarried daughters including Hema, and a son. The D'Souza family meet Sonu and approve of him. One day Sandeep rescues Sonu and Hema from a gang, and he eventually falls in love with Hema. Using his wealth, he buys off the D'Souza family, one by one, and then proposes marriage to Hema. Since the D'Souza family is unable to pay for marriage expenses, Sandeep agrees to pay for all the 4 sisters. He even offers a job to John's son in the USA. Thus indebted to Sandeep, the entire family now wants Hema to marry Sandeep instead of Sonu.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454780</url></doc>
