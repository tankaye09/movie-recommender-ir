<plot>Edward De Bono's hand sketches out words and simple pictures on a scrolling sheet of white paper. It seems we have been put in a cryogenic freeze in 1988, and have been brought out after discovering a cure for whatever terminal disease each of us might have had. This creates problems with those of us who have children, because they will be older than us. Television, government, the workplace, marriages and relationships, and punishments are all detailed in an attempt to inculcate the audience into the society we have been resurrected into. The video was shot in one morning before noon and transferred to film, where it received theatrical showing, highly touting its mickeymousing score by a _Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987)_ (qv) composer.</plot><plot>Edward De Bono's hand sketches out words and simple pictures on a scrolling sheet of white paper.
