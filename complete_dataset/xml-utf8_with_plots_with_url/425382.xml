<plot>Here we observe Joseph hurrying from the dominions of Herod while Jesus was still a babe, seeking refuge in Egypt, where fully a million of Jews then found a home. It will be noticed that as Mary, carrying the child Jesus, seats herself upon a rock on the road side, a vision of peaceful surroundings is manifest. As the vision disappears, Joseph is seen leading the way, pointing forward as they renew their journey.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425382</url></doc>
