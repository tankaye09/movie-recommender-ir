<plot>The Amazing Trousers is a comic and Gothic tale, set in Edwardian England. The story follows Henry, a meek loser who agrees to buy a pair of red trousers from a mysterious wheel-chair bound tailor. The trousers bring him success in life but in exchange, he will have to give up his legs after one year. We discover the Tailor had his own legs removed by his patron, a cruel Maharaja who was scared the trouser-maker would take his talents elsewhere. Our protagonist feels little sympathy though, as he awaits his own leg-related fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?539953</url></doc>
