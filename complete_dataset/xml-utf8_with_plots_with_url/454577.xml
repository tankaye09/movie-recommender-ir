<plot>Noble and compassionate Thakur Virendra Singh lives a wealthy life-style with his wife, Ratna, and two sons, Suraj and Prakash. Suraj falls in love with their Munshi, Din Dayal's daughter, Shobhna, but Ratna opposes this tooth and nail, as she wants her son to get married to a much wealthier girl and family, and cannot live with him marrying a mere employee's daughter. When Prakash falls in love with Kiran, he brings her home to introduce her to his mother, and she approves of her instantly, despite of the fact that Kiran comes from a poor family, and lives with her widowed mom, Janki. What Ratna does not know is that Janki was a courtesan in the very same city, and that her brother, Vikram, had actually paid a huge sum of money to spend some nights with her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454577</url></doc>
