<plot>A workaholic middle-aged scientist dies suddenly in a car crash seemingly as a result of the inattentiveness of the driver...his wife. He soon discovers that he is caught between life and the afterlife when his previously deceased daughter appears at the scene of the accident to guide him through the process of passing on. While watching his own funeral unfold he realizes that his long time friend and business partner has been neither. Through the assistance of his spirit daughter and a medium he struggles to warn his wife and family not realizing that his spirit daughter isn't all that she appears to be. The man is led on a roller coaster journey, darting in and out of being forever lost in the dark side of the afterlife all the while struggling to get a message to his wife. At the point where all hope is lost everything appears to be resolved only to come unraveled by forces more horrid than your worst nightmare.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200639</url></doc>
