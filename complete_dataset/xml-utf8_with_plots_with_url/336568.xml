<plot>"Likely Stories" was one Pay-TV's first original comedy programs. The one-hour shows were a mixed-bag of short films, videos, and animation that helped define the cutting-edge of today's no-holds- barred cable comedy programming. Each episode was chock-full of notable comedy stars eager to dabble in pay-cable's new found freedoms. The programs also featured the some of the earliest directing efforts of many of today's hottest filmmakers. Danny DeVito, Rob Reiner, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer are among the comedy stars who directed and appeared in short films for this unique anthology series.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336568</url></doc>
