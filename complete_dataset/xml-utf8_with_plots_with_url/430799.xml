<plot>Peur Hoi Nang Rom [For the Oysters] is the sweet and heart-breaking story of Wenai, a boy whose impoverished mother leaves him in the care of his grandmother. In the fishing village of Angsila, Wenai adjusts to his new surroundings while coping with the feeling of abandonment. His grandmother gives Wenai a loving and nurturing home, even when she struggles to put food on the table. Wenai's outlook on life changes when he meets, and becomes smitten with, his classmate Ann. Ann invites Wenai to her birthday dinner. A dish is required for the pot-luck feast requiring Wenai to go to work for his dream -- impressing Ann with a big fish. Just when Wenai thinks his struggle is over, fate strikes again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430799</url></doc>
