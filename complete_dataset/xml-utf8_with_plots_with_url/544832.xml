<plot>'The Blue Seal' follows John Kraft, a socially awkward farmer who longs for secluded retirement but is held back by his sordid involvement with a criminal delivery organization. Victim to relentless attempts on his life, this good-natured man finds himself pushed onto a path of violence until his irreversible deeds leave him with more solitude than he could have wished for. Shot in a 1960s action film style, the story of loss and redemption lays a hint of spectacle alongside its introspective character arc.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544832</url></doc>
