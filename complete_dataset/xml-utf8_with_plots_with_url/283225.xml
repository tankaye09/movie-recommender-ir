<plot>A portrait of 15-year-old Kaylee who lives in a caravan park with her neglectful father. The film follows Kaylee over a 24-hour period as she sneaks out from her chalet at dawn and wanders out into the local marshland. Kaylee leads a solitary existence, preferring to roam freely in the surrounding fields with only the company of wild horses. Ostracised by the community around her, the resilient Kaylee passively waits for her mother whom she believes will return to find her. When she discovers a man sleeping rough in a derelict house, she becomes fascinated by him and feels a kinship. Kaylee's challenging encounter with this enigmatic stranger compels her to re-evaluate her future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283225</url></doc>
