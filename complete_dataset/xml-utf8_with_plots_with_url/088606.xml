<plot>On October 27, 2001 five people made a cross country journey from Los Angeles to New York City and back to document how people's lives had been affected by the worst terrorist attack in our country's history. "911 in America" features frank and candid conversations with people who live in America, vacation in America, and love America. What they reveal about their true feelings on faith, politics, and the threat of terrorism, is not only frightening, but also surprisingly uplifting. Including exclusive footage of Ground Zero and interviews with NYC fireman Denis Patti.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088606</url></doc>
