<plot>R-Generation documents the real world behind the Fast and Furious. It is the first film to document the import automotive culture from its early beginnings in the back alley streets of Southern California to the multi-billion dollar movement heard around the world today. It's an eye-opening and often comical look at how a local hobby created by Asian American car crews have become a national lifestyle that has spread across all demographics. Shot nation-wide, R-Generation includes frank interviews with the people who have shaped this scene into what it is today - local car crews, racers, car builders, event promoters, import models, magazine publishers and nearly every mover and shaker who's played a part since it's inception in the mid 80's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452492</url></doc>
