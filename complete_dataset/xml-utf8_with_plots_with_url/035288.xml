<plot>What do women want? Market research tells us that three out of four new household products fail in the marketplace. Women in hats, gloves, and pearls help Corningware with product research on style, utility, and sales. They pick their favorites among newly-designed coffeemakers and try them out in test kitchens. Rocket research produces a new material; what products can be made with it and will people use them? Women come to Corningware Opinion Center, Corning, NY, to see and test products: first the product's shape, then the taste of the coffee; impact tests follow, then home trials. Corning repeats the process - and sets the price. Sales test complete the cycle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035288</url></doc>
