<plot>In response to overpopulation, the government mandates that people must hibernate two months of the year. A person's hibernation cycle is determined by the month of their birth and can not be changed. While hibernation does keep a sixth of the population out of circulation, the true population control effect of hibernation is that people must strategically date, marry and plan the birth of children around their cycle. Mis-cycled children must bear the brunt of their parents carelessness as they spend their youth hibernating without their family... as Jon did. Jon comes out of his hibernation to find that his girlfriend left him for a man of her own cycle. Realizing that his attempts to ignore society's restrictions consistently leads to heartbreak, Jon struggles with whether or not to accept that it is very unlikely he'll find happiness outside of his cycle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238384</url></doc>
