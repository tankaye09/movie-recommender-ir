<plot>Many of us assume that there are only two genders and that being female or male follows from the sex of our biological bodies. Focusing on the art, photography and performances of four "alternative" gender artists Assume Nothing poses the questions: "What if "male" and "female" are not the only options? How do other genders express themselves through art?" Assume Nothing takes its title from the work of renowned NZ photographer Rebecca Swan's book "Assume Nothing" (2004), which reveals an extraordinary diversity of gender identity from the Pacific region and beyond. Assume Nothing creates "living" portraits of four artists featured in Swan's work, woven together by a portrait of Swan herself as an artist, blurring the conventions of documentary, animation, drama and gender in the process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049049</url></doc>
