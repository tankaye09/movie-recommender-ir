<plot>Somewhere between 'Rear Window' and 'No Country for Old Men,' 'Indigo' is the story of Eli Casey, a photographer and recovering addict, struggling to create a masterpiece portfolio. During a business lunch, Casey's agent tells him that, while he has an exhibition lined up for his work, the owner of the exhibition feels his work only hits one note. Desperate to find 'a curve-ball,' Eli follows this couple through Central Park, taking pictures of them having sex. When his pregnant girlfriend, Cathy, comes over to help him look at the pictures, he discovers that, hidden in the background of one of the pictures, is a murder taking place. While Cathy goes to the police, Eli goes back to the park to look for more clues. Almost simultaneously, Eli discovers that the dead man is actually a police officer while Cathy learns that the murderer from the picture was also a cop... one who now has her in his clutches. Scared and powerless, Eli turns back to his old drug ways, trying to enlist his friends in an attempt to solve the mystery and rescue his pregnant girlfriend before the clock runs out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264458</url></doc>
