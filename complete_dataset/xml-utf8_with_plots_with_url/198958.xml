<plot>Leon's friend Harry Harvey wants to go on to a party after they return from a fishing trip, so Leon takes Harry's car and heads for home. A blonde, thinking the car is a Taxi, gets in and orders Leon to take her home. The police chase the speeding Leon, and he eludes them but they get the license number and arrest Harry. Leon tells the Judge that Harry was on his way to get married, and the judge offers to perform the ceremony. Leon is forced to masquerade as the bride, which lasts only until Harry's wife shows up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198958</url></doc>
