<plot>Chaudhry runs a posh hotel in the Indian countryside, but does not do very well due to poor patronage. One day a recently married young couple, Harish and Seema, rent one of the rooms for their honeymoon. That very night Seema is found killed in the bathtub. The Police are summoned but they are unable to get any clues. Harish meets with his friends, Chetan, Vinita, Ajay, Twinkle, Jai, Renuka, Anjali, Raj, and they offer to locate the killer by renting rooms in the hotel as newly married couples. Shortly thereafter Vinita, and then Twinkle gets killed. Then two men, Billa and Ranga are shot dead. Renuka is attacked but manages to survive. No one really knows who killed these people, as no clues were left behind, amidst theories of a killer seeking vengeance; animal poaching; a woman who is possessed by a dead man, and a deadly secret that has returned to haunt the girls' from their questionable past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?450316</url></doc>
