<plot>This film brings forcibly to mind the recent trouble between the European Governments and Venezuela when her port was blockaded. The Cruiser in the foreground is seen firing solid shot at one of the South American forts, the walls of which crumble before the broadside of steel and powder. The fort returns the fire but is not equal to the task, yet she holds her own and does not surrender.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212925</url></doc>
