<plot>Dressed as Pagliacci and standing in front of a simple set - a curtain and a small bench behind him, abstract cactus sculptures on stands to his left and right - Bernardo De Pace, "the Wizard of the Mandolin" plays several pieces. He performs as if before an audience, although there is no sound from them. The camera occasionally moves into a closeup of De Pace. Half-way through, a string breaks, but he continues without a pause. Is that his hair or a Bakelite helmet?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065892</url></doc>
