<plot>A couple talks about, and in a series of flashbacks we see, the evolution of their relationship. It starts innocently: he says, "I'm fond of you." She says, "Fond? I'm fond of my goldfish!" He tells her that in fact he loves her. She: "Say it again, you would if you loved me." And that phrase becomes their trump card as each takes turns asking the other to prove their love. We watch the challenges escalate from him giving her a cow mask to wear into a steak house and her reaching up to wiggle his ears in public to more and more outlandish tests. Finally, we find out to whom they are talking, and their listener asks them the ultimate question.</plot><plot>A couple talks about, and in a series of flashbacks we see, the evolution of their relationship.
