<plot>GHOST SCHOOL is a humorous, visual 3D television series set in the rather unusual school of a boy called Oliver, who cannot float nor remove his head, unlike his classmates and ghost friends. GHOST SCHOOL tells the story of friendship between the various, very different children, and between the human boy Oliver and his ghost friends, who, each night, embark on a journey through the ghost school, where even an ordinary piece of homework tends to conceal yet another adventure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214217</url></doc>
