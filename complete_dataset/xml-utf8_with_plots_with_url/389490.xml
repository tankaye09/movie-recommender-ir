<plot>Nano (short for Manuel) runs an oceanarium, Mundo Marino, in spite of the fact that his father, Noel, wants him to join the family enterprise as is expected of an aristocrat. Nano, an idealist, prefers to work in the magical and silent world of the animals he so loves--the dolphins, Orca whales, sea lions and penguins. By day he runs the oceanarium and the foundation to protect animals, but at night he comes to the aid of people. Secretly, he is "the Cat"--a sort of Robin Hood who steals from the rich and corrupt and gives to the poor. He will even steal thousands of dollars from his father's own safe to distribute to the workers who were fired by his father. Connected to his office is his secret "cave" where together with his closest friend, Sebastian, he plans the "cat's" actions. Also connected to his office is his little apartment where he finds peace and quiet away from his nagging wife, Rosario, whom he does not love. Although he has a lover, he says that he has never experienced the magical love that, by his definition, is felt from the waist up. Until he meets Camila. Camila, who became deaf and mute as a result of a childhood trauma (her parents were murdered), silently watches Nano at the oceanarium without him seeing, and photographs him without end. Her silent world joins to the silence of his world of water. They meet and fall in love. But will they be able to overcome the dark secrets of their past and the evils of the present to live and love in their magical world? What will happen when Camila remembers her past and recognizes Nano's father, Noel, as the murderer of her father. Will Nano's wife succeed in her insane schemes? And will Nano's and Camila's love for each other, that began in their long lost childhood, triumph in the end?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?389490</url></doc>
