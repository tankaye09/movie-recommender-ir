<plot>Does love really conqueror all? Uma Balachandran, a 20-something Indian American woman is at a unique crossroads: faced with a romantic, sunrise proposal from her African American boyfriend John Ray, her instinct is to say yes. But she's haunted by her father's wishes for her to marry the perfect Indian man. What's worse, Uma's old flame of 4 years, the all-American Troy Black, wants Uma back so badly, he's planning to storm in on Uma and John and break up their sunrise tryst. But an unlikely stranger alters his destiny forever. Does love really conquer anything? Maybe. Maybe not. Set in front of the rising sun behind the beautiful backdrop of San Francisco, This Moment is about choices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604939</url></doc>
