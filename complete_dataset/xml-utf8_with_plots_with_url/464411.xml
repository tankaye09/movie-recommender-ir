<plot>Biography of 1940's sex goddess Rita Hayworth. Born Margarita Cansino, she studied dancing from the age of 5 and was soon part of the family's night club act. By age 18 she was married and pursuing a movie career. She reached her peak appeal with the movie Gilda, but found that people expected her to be that character in real life. In fact she was shy and introverted. Married four times (most notably to Orson Welles and Ali Khan) she had two children and was a dedicated and loving mother. As she got older, she focused on more dramatic roles but the early onset of Alzheimer's disease rendered it difficult for her to learn her lines. She died in 1987.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?464411</url></doc>
