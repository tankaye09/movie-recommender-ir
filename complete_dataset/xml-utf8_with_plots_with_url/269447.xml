<plot>In the year 2097, mankind has been forced underground after the destruction of the ozone layer. A new magnetic train system called Isobar represents the first attempt at reconnecting the world. In its maiden route from New Los Angeles to New Tokyo, a thousand guests were invited. One was not... and it causes the train to hurtle out of control at more than 1,000 mph, threatening to destroy the world if it ever reaches New Tokyo.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269447</url></doc>
