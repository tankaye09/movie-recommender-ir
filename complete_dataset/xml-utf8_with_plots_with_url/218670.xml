<plot>Sweet-natured Cleitus has more on his mind than your normal teenaged wrestler, namely a grapefruit-sized goiter protruding from his neck. When popular cheerleader Haley loses a bet and is forced to go on a date with him, Cleitus finds himself torn between his new-found romance and his vengeful fantasies against the small-minded townsfolk who ridicule him. The state wrestling championship is on the line, and Cleitus must rise above his violent hallucinations in order to earn Haley's affection and uncover her hidden identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218670</url></doc>
