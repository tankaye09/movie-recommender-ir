<plot>Charlie trips on a hole in his carpet and decides the family needs a new one. He buys one but decides to install it himself (rather than hiring a professional). Things do not go smoothly. He gets in hot water with a policeman on the way home and breaks a window with the carpet upon returning. In moving the furniture to install the carpet, Charlie gets a lamp knocked on his head, drops a piano through the floor, and smashes a police car with a runaway TV set (again angering the policeman). Finally, the furniture is moved outside but it starts to rain! Luckily, Junior covers the furniture...with the carpet. They finally get the carpet laid but it apparently shrinks when wet and is reduced to a tiny size! Again, all that trouble goes to waste!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085886</url></doc>
