<plot>2-part 2-hour documentary follows the Marines of Delta Company from Kwaut to Baghdad in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Marine cameramen shooting high definition show the Iraq War as it's never been seen. Follow Capt. Greg Poland as he and his Marines capture an Iraqi colonel, fight the Battle of Basra Bridge, lose a tank crew - and fight their way across the Diyala River Bridge in the Marine Corps' first opposed bridge crossing in a half century. In Bahdad, the Marines take down the regime - and deal with looting and lawlessness in its wake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135952</url></doc>
