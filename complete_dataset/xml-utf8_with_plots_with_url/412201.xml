<plot>A presentation of blues singer Alberta Hunter, famous in the 1920s, 30s and 40s and then almost forgotten until she re-emerged for a celebrated comeback in 1974 in her mid-eighties. On this program she sings several of her favorite and best known songs. Whitney Balliett, music critic for The New Yorker, provides commentary. Miss Hunter's musicians are Gerald Cook (piano) and Al Hall (bass).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412201</url></doc>
