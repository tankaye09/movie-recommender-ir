<plot>"Hebron is the gateway to heaven". This is the writing that greets you as you pass the heavy security check and enter into a war torn city that is a center of a war ridden region. Hebron is a city in the West Bank in Israel, where 120,000 Arabs and 600 Jews live side by side, creating the most extreme point of heat and tension in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Jewish and the Arab populations were never in good terms but the recent deterioration of the political situation have fused unbearable violence, so much so that the government had no choice but to completely separate the Jewish population from the rest of the Arab town, constructing huge and continues concrete walls virtually in every place where Jews and Arabs could possibly interact. Today Hebron looks like a ghost town with empty streets and ruined houses all along the roads. Taking art as the most expressive human creation, capable to reveal the most hidden nuances of the human character as well as the general cultural nuances of a civilization, the film is trying to examine the Jewish population of Hebron by looking at their art work. The movie follows 2 Jewish artist who live and work in Hebron, giving the city different interpretations through their art work and captures paintings created by the children from Hebron, depicting deferent sites and events in the city. The movie is accompanied by interviews with both the artists and the children talking about the political situation, their paintings, and their feelings about the city. The movie is trying to capture the tragedy and absurdity of the life amidst a violent conflict without judging the people but rather by trying understand their way of life and their values.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210651</url></doc>
