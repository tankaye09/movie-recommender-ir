<plot>Hitler's Atlantic Wall tells the exciting story of the German Atlantic line of defense during the Second World War. On Hitler's orders, hundreds of thousands of people have built a gigantic wall of bunkers, cannons and fortifications from the north of Norway to the Pyreneans, some 4,500 kilometers long. A megalomaniac project and a painful memory of a sombre episode in Western history. Hitler's Atlantic Wall is a testimony to brilliancy, but also the lust for power and the madness of the Nazi thinkers and strategists. But this is also a story of those who lived, worked, fought and often died there.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241814</url></doc>
