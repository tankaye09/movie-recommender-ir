<plot>Four actors moonlight as Hollywood hit men in the hopes of advancing their stagnant careers. Hand-picked by their "manager" Orson, they spend their days auditioning and their nights working in the dark, violent underworld of Hollywood, where scandals are created and careers are destroyed. Using the promise of stardom as bait, Orson recruits his actors with the promise: "You do jobs for me, I get jobs for you." The series follows their desperate struggle to become famous and break free from Orson, who (they will learn) has no intention of letting them go. As their sinister work pulls them further from their dreams, they cling to the belief that fame will redeem them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241631</url></doc>
