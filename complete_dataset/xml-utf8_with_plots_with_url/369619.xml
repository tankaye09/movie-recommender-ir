<plot>Mikey Chambers has made it a habit of being late to school, until one day, his worse nightmare comes true. He is told that if he is late one more time, he will have cafeteria duty for one month. The very next morning, Mikey wakes up late and has missed the bus. He rushes to get ready and the adventure begins, to get to school on time. It's not as easy as it sounds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?369619</url></doc>
