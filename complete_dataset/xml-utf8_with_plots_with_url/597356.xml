<plot>In the summer of 2004 with the growing death toll in Iraq, the increasing cost of the war and the now public incompetence of the British Ministry of Defence, four lads with no media experience posed as film makers and set out on a self funded road journey to discovery the truth about weapons of mass destruction. Despite having no budget and a only basic knowledge of history they soon found themselves amongst stockpiles of chemical weapons (with the full co-operation of one of Europe's ministers of defense). It turns out that Europe has a chemical weapons problem and the lads spend a few days filming the clean up process with the dedicated soldiers charged with this dangerous but gallant task. With discoveries of chemical weapons which only Hans Blix could have dreamed of this film shows how easy it is for any one to find chemical weapons and explores the possibility that one could be easily be brought back to London. A truly explosive critique of the Ministry of Defence, the weapons 'dossier' and any minister who voted for the war in Iraq.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597356</url></doc>
