<plot>Roshan lives a poor lifestyle in Bombay along with his widowed mother. His mother thinks that her son is gainfully employed but Roshan has made crime his career and picks pockets and gambles for a living. A gangster named Shankar wants to hire him, but Roshan refuses. Then one day Roshan steals 3000 Rupees from a man named Mohan, who was about to remit this amount to his Madhopur-based widowed mother and unmarried sister, Shukal, so that they can pay off the mortgage on their residence. When the money gets stolen, Mohan kills himself. A guilt-ridden Roshan travels to Madhopur, pays off their debt, and returns home without telling anyone about Mohan's demise. Madhopur Police subsequently find out that the money was stolen from Universal Bank and start an investigation. Roshan is faced with another challenge when Shukal and Manglu Mama come to the city to meet Mohan, and both Roshan and Shukal fall in love with each other. To complicate their romance, a cabaret dancer, Rita, pretends to fall in love with Roshan and moves in to live with him and his mother while the Police close in on Roshan - threatening to expose him as a thief in his mother's and everyone's eyes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436666</url></doc>
