<plot>Simply FOBulous is a romantic comedy about a rebellious daughter who succumbs to her mother's dying wish for her to marry a Vietnamese mail-order husband. Unwilling to marry him when he arrives, Thuy loans him to her sister Van, who uses him to hold her shopping bags and other important tasks. Both sisters look down on Dung's simple Third World ways. However, Dung finds his own way to adapt to life in America by becoming friends with a trio of bubble tea loving Vietnamese guys from work. They show him the ropes, teach him a few dirty words, and help him find his way around America. Dung reveals his secret to them, that he speaks English fluently, and that he knows what his host family really thinks of him. They've only been looking out for their own best interests, with little regard for Dung's. After all, to them, Dung is a FOB, or "Fresh Off the Boat'. What does he know about anything? To everyone's surprise, Dung's secret is revealed, along with a hidden romance for an unexpected member of the Nguyen family. A wedding happens after all, and in doing so, it brings a divided family back together. Dung shows them the error of their ways, and that there is no shame in being a "FOB", or as his friends put it, "Simply FOBulous".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?497741</url></doc>
