<plot>Don Mayberry has it all, a wonderful house, a great job, a fantastic wife and a gorgeous eight-year-old daughter named Shelly. Across the tracks, in a poor part of town, Boyd has just the opposite. A bad marriage, a sick baby, a terrible job and an appalling home life. Don has everything to lose. Boyd has nothing to lose and when Shelly is snatched off the street in broad daylight, the gap between "Everything" and "Nothing" begins to close. As the story unfolds, Shelly's perfect world begins to unravel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188270</url></doc>
