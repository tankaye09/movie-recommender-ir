<plot>In the late sixties, a remarkable story in Australian motorsport began. It was a time when the Holden car was ubiquitous in Australia but even though they were strongly represented on the race tracks - it was without factory recognition. To get around a world-wide ban by General Motors on motorsport, in 1969 Holden engaged the wily Harry Firth to manage a team called The Holden Dealer Team, supposedly supported by Holden retailers. What followed was Australian motorsport legend. From the team's first drivers in Colin Bond and Peter Brock in the Monaro GTS 350, through the Torana dominated seventies and the Commodore dominated early eighties. The documentary documents the mighty battles between the little Torana XU1 and big Ford GTHO Falcons, the domination of the Torana A9X, the stunning debut of the Commodore in the Repco round-Australia rally in 1979, and the emergence of Peter Brock as an Australian icon at Bathurst.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226348</url></doc>
