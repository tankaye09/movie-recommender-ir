<plot>A happy family are seated at their table dining. "Hubby" leaves the room ostensibly to get something from the kitchen, but when he arrives there he makes violent love to the cook. "Wifey" becomes suspicious, and hearing a strange noise, she listens attentively at the door. The noise there confirms her suspicions and she bursts into the room and catches the guilty pair. She belabors her husband and the cook is ordered to leave the house instantly. The old man receives more lectures until his wife catches a glimpse of the back of his coat and sees the imprint of the cook's hand in flour on same, when she beats him unmericfully. This film will get a laugh anywhere you show it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655929</url></doc>
