<plot>Ever wonder what really goes on in a sorority house overflowing with the most beautiful, most spirited and most available college women who ever graced a campus anywhere? Well we can't guarantee that Swinging Sorority will show it the way it actually is, but it will definitely be everything you ever fantasized it might be. Meet Mary Beth - blonde, gorgeous and incredibly naive; and Chris - a stunner with a passion for mind-boggling go-go dancing at the local campus hangout; as well as Norma, and Karen, and Randy, and 4-Eyes - the bookworm who turns into the most enticing butterfly of them all. Swinging Sorority is a joyful, sex-filled, uninhibited romp, combining beauty, sensuality and fun into one unforgettable bombshell of a film!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525696</url></doc>
