<plot>When a mother loses her only child in a horrific traffic accident on Christmas day, she makes a wish. Suddenly, the next day is not the next day, and Sandy Morrison gets one more chance to say goodbye. Lost in denial, side-lining her emotions as if it was just a dream, she doesn't even realize she's getting a second chance until it's too late. Sandy asks to relive Christmas day, over and over, in an attempt to keep Alex, her son, alive. The world, however, is also living the day over and over, and is not able to continue until she's able to let Alex go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130540</url></doc>
