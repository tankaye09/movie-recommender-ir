<plot>Ever know somebody too nice? Lovable, but you just want to smack them? That's Bob, 34, witty and self-deprecating. Bob meets the right girl. Smart and beautiful. Her beauty turns out to be a problem, because now Bob has to compete. Eric has known Bob for 15 years. They roomed together when they first hit New York. Eric is forced to move back in with Bob. During the move, Bob brings along his new girl, Mona. She's 22 and comes from an affluent background, but wants to make it on her own. She longs for the bohemian life-style she read about in books, but her temp job is dousing her dreams. That's when Mona meets Eric. He makes a nutty pass at her, half hoping she slaps him. She doesn't. Mona loves Bob, but with Eric there are sparks. Now Eric and Bob are living together and Mona is the minefield between them. Are the guys kidding themselves about her, or is this a love worth losing a best-friend?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375203</url></doc>
