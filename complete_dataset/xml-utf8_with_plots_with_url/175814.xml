<plot>Dawn sits at the edge of the sofa. There is nothing in her hand, but she and Leo talk about what she is holding. Since she is a child, no one would ever call it a lie. Eloise combs her hair in front of the mirror too tired to be angry. She lies to herself but we all do. We believe we can do things that affect only us. Welcome Leo and the tea party. It is where the questions are asked... Does a little girl lie when she introduces you to a friend you cannot see? Does a woman lie, lying next to a man she never loved? Does a man lie knowing truth but not acting on it? The question is, "What Is Real?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175814</url></doc>
