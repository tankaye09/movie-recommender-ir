<plot>On January 7, 1979, at 3:14 p.m. in the middle of the third quarter of the AFC championship game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Houston Oilers, Archie McNally, a seventh-generation Pittsburgher, wearing a helium filled wet suit, flew across the field, disrupting the game. In 2001, Mr. McNally sits for the camera and explains what it was all about -- not a stunt for notoriety or a fan's expression of enthusiasm, but a son's attempt to reach his deceased father who died just before the Steelers' years at the top. As the tale unfolds, it's one of sorrow, mental illness and a ruptured family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255595</url></doc>
