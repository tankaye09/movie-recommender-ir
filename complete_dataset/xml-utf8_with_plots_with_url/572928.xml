<plot>Edgar Allen Poe (John Shepperd) led an unhappy childhood, broken only by the unceasing devotion of his foster mother, Mrs. Frances Allan (Mary Howard), whose loving ministrations gave him courage to carry out his desire to write. His first love was Elmira Royster (Virginia Gilmore), and though she married another while he was at the University of Virginia, he could never purge his thoughts of her and, under the influence of her spell, he poured out the deepest passions of his heart. After a discouraging period during which he was disowned by his foster father and lost his appointment to West Point, he found the love that tamed his restless heart with Virginia Clemm (Linda Darnell). After he and Virginia married, Poe did his greatest creative work, writing for the Southern Literary Messenger and Graham's Magazine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572928</url></doc>
