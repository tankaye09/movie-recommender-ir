<plot>Kalyana Parisu, director C.V.Sridhar's debut film, deals with triangle love, two women vying for the same man. The film enjoyed huge box-office popularity. Gemini Ganesh is a bachelor, who had to leave his college before finishing his final year at University. He meets Thangavelu in a park and they become friends. Gemini Ganesh goes to rent a house, where the house owner is a mother living with her two young and unmarried daughters. The younger girl(Saroja Devi) is prettier and studies in college. She and Gemini fall in love, but this is not known to the others. Meanwhile the elder sister (Vijayakumari) also falls in love with Gemini . The younger sister gives up her love for elder sister's sake, this sacrifice is unknown to the elder sister. This film presented Ganesh as a victimized, tragic hero in a melodramatic story supporting the observance of social convention.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?285253</url></doc>
