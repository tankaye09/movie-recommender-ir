<plot>Featuring a cast of computer-animated mythical creatures and humans, "Corkscrew Hill" immerses guests in a Celtic journey that is conveyed through a four-and-a-half minute animated story and large format stereoscopic 3-D experience. It is important to note that the animated story takes place during one continuous shot - with no cuts or cheats. Also, the ride showcases a number of innovations including digital stereoscopic projection, a stereoscopic pre-show and motion base technology. The "Corkscrew Hill" story takes guests back in time and uses myths of Ireland, computer-animation and new projection technologies to create the illusion that the audience shrinks down to the size of fairies. The premise of the ride is that, after being miniaturized, guests are directed into an old wooden box where they are strapped into seats and from which they embark on an adventure. After two boys, Paddy and Fenton, find the box, "Corkscrew Hill" guests encounter a cast of fantastic mythical creatures and giant-like human characters who appear on screen at six to eight times their normal size. And, at the height of the adventure, guests have the chance to cast some magical spells of their own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115622</url></doc>
