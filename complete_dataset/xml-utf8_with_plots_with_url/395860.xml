<plot>Train station cafe and a cute night. A young couple is sitting at the table next to the window, through which they see the trains go by. "It's really an awfully simple operation." He says. They try to stay calm. Try to control themselves. The woman sees white elephants through the window. The man tells her that he'll love her more if she "goes through with it." She smiles. He doesn't understand. She does. She understands everything. He gets irritated, frustrated, helpless. He wants to go outside to get some fresh air. Smokes. Train flashes by. Tears. Smile. She feels fine. Everything's fine. Nothing happened. Nothing really. Nothing at all. Nothing ever does.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?395860</url></doc>
