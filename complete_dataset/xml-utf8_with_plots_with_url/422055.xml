<plot>The scene starts at 19th street and Fifth avenue. The picture was taken from an automobile and shows the arch full to life size. During the approach of the camera the spectators imagine themselves passing under the arch and proceeding up Fifth avenue. The automobile then turns suddenly into 26th street, toward Broadway. The graceful arch and wonderful historical columns form a very attractive background. This picture also gives the spectator a glimpse of two of New York's greatest thoroughfares, as the arch is located at the junction of Broadway and Fifth avenue, better known as Madison Square.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422055</url></doc>
