<plot>The film introduces Baranov and his nemesis, Hagemeister, who has sailed to New Archangel to overthrow Baranov and implement naval rule. We see Hagemeister's ship rise from the ocean, unfurling its sails as the crew of sailors and the fearsome Angry Jack clamor to see the impressive home of Baranov perched on the bluff. Hagemeister's second in command, Yavonski meets Baranov's lovely daughter Irina and soon falls in love with her despite the fact that his commander is set on wresting her father's colony from him. As Baranov maneuvers to care for both the future of his colony and his daughter, the story unfolds in song and dialog, building to a spectacular finale. Shot on location in various breathtaking Alaska locations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059035</url></doc>
