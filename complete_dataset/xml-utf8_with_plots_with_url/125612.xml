<plot>Larry and Melissa have been friends for years, and he has always been there for her, perhaps wanting a little more than friendship. Now she's on a spiral of self-destruction, calling him only when she needs help, knowing he won't abuse that trust. But there's been too many years and too much regret; like many of us, Larry finds himself somewhere between caring and crossing the line.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125612</url></doc>
