<plot>FLUSH! OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE TOILET begins with filmmaker Ari Grief's epiphany that "life would be very different without the toilet." Startled that he knows so little about something he has depended upon his entire life, Ari hits the road to learn all he can about the wonderful hygienic appliance we all know and love. But not in his wildest dreams could he imagine he would find himself smack in the middle of a global toilet "movement," resulting in his unlikely conversion from everyman to toilet activist.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198430</url></doc>
