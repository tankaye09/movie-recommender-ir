<plot>In order to placate a crying baby that's disturbing his sleep, Felix steals a barber pole that the child thinks is a giant peppermint stick. Felix gets arrested for the theft and thrown in prison. He tries to tunnel out, but winds up digging a hole straight into a pond, which drains into the prison and floods the yard. He finally escapes by riding on a horse he disguises as a zebra by transferring the stripes from his prison uniform onto it, but that's not the end of his adventures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514159</url></doc>
