<plot>Filmed along the same lines as What the Bleep, The Secret, and The Celestine Prophecy. This too will be an interactive motion picture that delves into the questions everyone has been asking for centuries. How do I become Wealthy? What do I do with my ideas? How can someone find their passion? What does it take to truly be Happy? We already understand there are different answers for different people on what 'medium' they used to create success for themselves in these areas, yet we want to go deeper. We want to know (and so does the world) what were the actual STEPS that todays leaders took toward success and the sequence of events that took place to make it all come together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425066</url></doc>
