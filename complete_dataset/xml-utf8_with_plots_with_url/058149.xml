<plot>Wealthy business, Chaubey, his wife, Lily, and daughter, Madhubala, return from Britain in order to visit India and find a suitable groom for Madhubala. They are met at the airport by Vikram, who would like to marry Madhubala. Though Lily fully approves of Vikram, Chaubey dislikes him instantly. They travel to the small town where Chaubey was born, and meet with Gopi. Gopi and Madhubala take an instant liking to each other, and get married. While Chaubey approves of this marriage, Lily does not. Lily gets together with Vikram and sets about to plot separating the newly married couple. She may not ply her skills as they are incompatible in every possible way, and may not need any help from anyone outside in order to break up this marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058149</url></doc>
