<plot>A newly married couple desiring a baby, visit a doll shop and after looking over the large dolls, decide that they want a genuine baby. The attendant, seeing that her prospective customers desire a real baby instead of a doll, advises them that she can supply the demand. She takes them through a door in which there is a sign "Reserve." Here the scene changes to a cabbage patch and the trio is seen to enter. Cloths are spread on the ground and from the large heads of cabbage are taken a number of tiny babies. They are placed on the ground, where they squirm and kick around. After about eight babies are looked over, the couple select one and pay for it. Then they leave the garden with their treasure, closing the picture. A novel and very unique subject, certain to please.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088385</url></doc>
