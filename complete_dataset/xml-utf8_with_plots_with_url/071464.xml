<plot>This Science-Fiction short tells the story of an old monk, undertaking a long voyage in a strange flying vehicle. His diary entries tell a story: his story and the story of the vehicle. In the past, strange buildings were found; alien architecture. Ornaments on these objects were deciphered as writing and the writings turned out to be a construction manual - for the flying vehicle. The vehicle was built and someone had to fly away in it, although no-one knew where it was going and which function it had. The monk tells us this story, while he arrives at his destination - the city of Biopolis. The living city, that sent off its flying vehicles in all directions, in order to guarantee its reproduction. And so the vehicle with its human cargo lands and melts into the city. A new lifeform is born.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071464</url></doc>
