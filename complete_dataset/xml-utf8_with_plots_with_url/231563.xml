<plot>Jimmy has borrowed money from a loan shark to soup up his car, anticipating a bonus from work. When he gets fired - without the bonus - and the loan shark leans on him for repayment, he tells his wife that his sister needs rehab and he tells his sister's husband that his own wife needs rehab. The word spreads and sympathy runs high. Cash may be coming in and he'll be able to pay his debt. Does life run as smoothly and as sweet as his car's new engine?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231563</url></doc>
