<plot>Murderabilia - n. collectibles from, by, or about murderers. Among serial killer enthusiasts, Billy Shotz is king. Want a lock of Charles Manson's hair? He's got it. Want a John Wayne Gacy painting? He can get you one. No matter the killer, no matter the crime, Billy's ready to cut a deal. Serial killers aren't just his hobby and they aren't just his business - they're his passion. So when a letter appears on his doorstep inviting him to an exclusive auction, one that promises to feature an item more valuable than any he's ever bid upon, how can he say no? What Billy doesn't know is that the auction will prove to be unlike anything he's ever experienced. The eerie guests, silent and masked, are more than mere collectors, as is the mysterious and beautiful auctioneer, Agatha. Descending into the auction's surreal and sinister world, Billy learns that his ghoulish collection has cost him far more than money; and as the macabre evening nears its grim climax, he discovers a terrifying truth: That death, while cold and terrible, is not entirely without justice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381998</url></doc>
