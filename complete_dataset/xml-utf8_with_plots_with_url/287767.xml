<plot>The King of All Cosmos has a little dilemma. After a night of partying, he awakens to find out that all the stars are missing. It seems the immeasurably large King had a bit too much to drink the night before, and in his drunkenness, he took a swing at the sky, reducing the entire population of stars to mere stardust. Realizing what he has done, he calls upon his son, a cute, green creature with a mallet-shaped head and a height of about two inches, to clean up the royal mess he has made. The lazy, condescending King sends the Prince to Earth to roll up the entire planet's contents into several balls of varying sizes, called "katamari", so he can launch them into space to act as makeshift stars. You play the role of the nameless Prince, and you must "roll up" as many objects as you can in the time alloted to make the largest possible katamari. As the game progresses, so does the size of your katamari, until it is eventually large enough to collect animals, people, buildings, and even land masses!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287767</url></doc>
