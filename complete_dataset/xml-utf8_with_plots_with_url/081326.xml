<plot>Based on the actual "Boy's Ranch" located in Oldham County, Texas northwest of Amarillo, Texas. The ranch was started in 1939 by ex-wrestler Cal Farley of Amarillo as a home for underprivigeled boys when rancher Julian Blivins donated the old Tascosa courthouse and 120 acres of land for Farley's project. It started with Farley and his wife and six boys, and currently has over 400 boys and fifty buildings on 4000 acres of farm/ranch land and its own post office and school. Now known as Cal Farley's Boy's Ranch. This film is a semi-western version of MGM's earlier "Boy's Town" plot-wise in which a snarling little petty thief and liar (played by, who else, Skip Homeier in a repeat of his Nazi brat in "Tomorrow the World)who comes to the ranch and immediately makes problems. His comeuppance and redemption is a foregone conclusion, although many viewing the film were rooting for him to end up in Tascosa's old Boot Hill. James Craig and Dorothy Patrick play the characters of Cal Farley and his wife under fictional names.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081326</url></doc>
