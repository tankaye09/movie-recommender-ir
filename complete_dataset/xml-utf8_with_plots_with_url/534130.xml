<plot>Three robbers, Lal Singh, Heeralal Ghosh, and Zoravar, rob the gold vault of a bank, take off with all the gold bars they can carry, and bury it deep in the countryside. Several weeks later, when they return to share the bars between them, they find them gone. Suspecting a nearby family of having stolen their gold, they kill the husband, wife, Shanti, and hang the young son, and abscond upon hearing people coming to investigate this commotion. Twenty years later, a man named Tejaa meets with Lal Singh, and kills him. Then Tejaa meets with Heeralal, befriends him, and then subsequently kills him. When Zoravar finds out that he could be Tejaa's next victim, he starts to take all possible precautions so as to foil Tejaa, who is none other than the son of the couple that were killed by the three bandits. Zoravar and Mahendra, Heeralal's son, lay an elaborate trap for Tejaa - and this time they will make sure that they avenge their former partners and father respectively.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?534130</url></doc>
