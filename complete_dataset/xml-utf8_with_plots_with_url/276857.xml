<plot>Advocate Narayan Das lives a comfortable lifestyle in rural India with his wife, Annapurna, who insists on feeding everyone who is hungry; and a lovely daughter, Shobha. Since Shobha is of marriageable age, he has arranged to get her married to Advocate Anand and shows his photograph to her, and she shyly approves. The young man shows up, and to the family's delight, not only is he well versed in Law but also in dairy farming. Both Anand and Shobha fall in love with each other, and want to get married. They already have the blessings of Annapurna and Narayandas. Then one day while at a picnic, Anand excuses himself from Shobha's company as he wants to meet a friend. Shobha secretly follows him and is shocked to see him in the arms of another woman, Indu, who is the only daughter of wealthy Chairman Neelkanth. Watch what happens when Shobha confronts Anand with her knowledge and asks him why he has been two-timing her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276857</url></doc>
