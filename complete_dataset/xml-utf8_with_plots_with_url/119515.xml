<plot>CROSSING THE LINE is a contemporary political thriller that confronts some of the dilemmas around power and corruption in South Africa. From the writer/director of THE LINE which was screened ten years ago to the biggest ever audience to watch a drama series in South Africa, the new series, CROSSING THE LINE, deals with contemporary issues and characters in a way that reflects the time and manages a glimpse at the state of the nation's complex soul. Journalist Mandla Kunene investigates allegations of corruption linked to a prominent government minister. The tip-off comes from the minister's jilted mistress - Irene. Mandla is only half interested but when Irene appears to have been pushed over her 6th floor balcony Mandla takes up the story and each step of the way his investigation is met with resistance - from his friends, his boss; investigators and the police.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119515</url></doc>
