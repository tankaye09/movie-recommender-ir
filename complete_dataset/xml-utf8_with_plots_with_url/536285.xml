<plot>When Terrorist attacked the World Trade Center on September 11th, our lives were forever changed. No one, not even the CIA, could have predicted the scale of destruction and complete disregard to human life the world saw that day. That is why Emperical Pictures, along with Citizen Films, teamed up with FEMA and the US Department of Homeland Security, to produce a high quality film entitled: 'Terrorism and You!'. This PSA aims to inform viewers of what measures they need to take to become less of a target for Terrorists and acts of Terrorism. There are three basic elements that could possibly achieve this goal. They are: keep informed; make an ESK (Emergency Supply Kit); and where and how to panic during an attack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536285</url></doc>
