<plot>"This is a very rare film showing an artillery battery charging. Unusual facilities were conceded to our artist in taking this picture which is the only one of its kind ever made. The galloping horses dragging the ponderous guns, riders urging their steeds to greater exertions and the wonderful speed attained at the time the picture was taken render this beyond any question the most exciting and thrilling of all military films. When shown in the largest Metropolitan theatres it has never failed to create furore."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061030</url></doc>
