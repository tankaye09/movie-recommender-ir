<plot>"Panicked" is a satirical tale of two women struggling to find themselves in a world where they feel misunderstood. Briana is an outspoken, panic attack-ridden young woman and Catherine is her prescriptive drug-addicted therapist. Briana feels helpless and overwhelmed by world affairs which escalates her panic attacks into a fear of driving. Meanwhile Catherine is lost in a perpetual state of disillusionment as her husband has become her oppressor. Her spirit defeated, she self-medicates to cope. Therapy sessions hit a wall because of Catherine's inability to stay sober and coherent. During their time apart, they come to realize they were instrumental in helping each other confront their anxieties.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421719</url></doc>
