<plot>Sonu, his sister, Sasha, and their friend, Akhil, live a poor lifestyle in India. While Sasha has given her heart to Akhil, he treats her as a close friend and confidant. Times get so tough, that the trio conspire to carry out robberies, and end up doing so - quite successfully, eluding the authorities. When Sashs finds out that Akhil does not love her, she threatens to kill herself and misunderstandings break out between the three. Subsequently, they part ways, and a short time later Sonu is informed that Sasha is dead. Years later, a young woman, Dr. Sri Vidya, enters Sonu's life and he befriends her and her dad, so much so that he even aids them financially. What Sonu does not know is that Sri is in love with Akhil, who she met when her TV set was accidentally damaged by one of his Akhil's taxi-drivers. She does not know that Sonu has always blamed Akhil for Sasha's death. Watch what happens when Akhil re-enters Sonu's life, and they find out that Sasha did not die, but was murdered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522032</url></doc>
