<plot>The room looks like a lavish nightclub. The Ambassadors, a 15-piece band dressed in tuxedos, play three numbers: "Nobody But You," "That Reminds Me of You," and a jazzy rag. Gus Arnheim is at the piano, his direction is understated. Occasionally, a trio of musicians sings a few bars with light voices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225259</url></doc>
