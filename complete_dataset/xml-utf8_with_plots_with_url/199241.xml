<plot>Raja lives in Dubai, U.A.E. and is a career-criminal, partnered by his girlfriend, Tina, and her maternal uncle, Chobey. Raja also makes additional money by masquerading as Rahul, the son of Lajwanti, who was killed in an accident. Since Chobey owes money to a gangster named Moscow Chikna, Raja decides to help him out by arranging the abduction of Rocky, a jewel thief, who has a priceless diamond in his possession. If Raja and his gang do not bring this diamond to Moscow Chikna, he has sworn to cut off their arms. When another gangster, JD, finds out about the diamond, he asks them to bring the diamond to him or else he will cut off their legs. The trio abduct Rocky - only to be threatened by a London-based gangster, Chokshi, who has recruited Gunmaster G9, who has threatened to cut off their respective necks if the diamond is not surrendered to Chokshi. Chaos prevails as the hapless trio, their lives complicated by the bumbling Kuttu Pilot, hustle to save their lives - in vain attempts to try and pacify the three gangsters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199241</url></doc>
