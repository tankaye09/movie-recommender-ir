<plot>In 1883, in Italy, Father Dom Bosco had a visionary dream about the building of the city of Brasilia, capital of Brazil since 1960. It was revealed to him that, at the day of his death, a process of three generations of sixty years each would begin. In the first two generations, mankind's attitudes would be evaluated, and its consequences would start over the promised city after 120 years. We are at the beginning of the third generation, when a group of friends realizes that the capital city is being roamed by the living dead, and they attempt survival at every cost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008146</url></doc>
