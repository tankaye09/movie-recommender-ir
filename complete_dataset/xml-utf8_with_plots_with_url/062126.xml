<plot>After losing his wife and his hearing in a horrific accident, Terry is trapped in a living purgatory. Isolating himself in a condemned building, he struggles with his rage and loss, only venturing out of his self-imposed prison to participate in brutal, unsanctioned, bare-knuckle fights in order to make a couple bucks to survive on. The film begins with Terry in his apartment and follows him on his journey throughout the city as he interacts with other lost souls throughout his voyage to his destination: a rundown bar on the outskirts of town operated by Franky, a former bare-knuckle fighter. In the basement of the seedy bar, Terry must face his toughest challenger yet; a beast of a man called Gus. Not only must Terry battle his daunting opponent, but his inner demons as well, because even if he wins the bare-knuckle fight against Gus; Terry may lose his soul to his fury.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062126</url></doc>
