<plot>This should be essential viewing for all 9/11 conspiracy theorists. It examines all the conspiracies circulating on the Internet and elsewhere, and neatly demolishes them with the truth. With original source material rather than distortions and mis-quotes, and with interviews with people who were there. It also explains why so many people feel the need to believe these conspiracy theories; their government has already lied to them so often, why shouldn't they believe they'd been lied to again? The most telling comments were the ones that describe conspiracy theorists as people who just can't believe that such an act could be done by a few dedicated people. If that's possible, then nothing is safe. So they believe the conspiracy. In fact they are right to be concerned. Nothing is safe. But this was an act committed by a few dedicated people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007105</url></doc>
