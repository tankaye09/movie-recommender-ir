<plot>Supported by excellent 3-D animation and insight from medical professionals, this series examines sports injuries and the perseverance of dedicated athletes who put recovery and comeback ahead of all else. Sport at the highest level means big business, big money and the fiercest of competition. Athletes must be prepared to sacrifice their bodies to win. Many suffer injuries that not only end their careers but also disable them for life. Others persevere through the torture of agonizing rehab. It is a test both physical and mental that many fail. We talk to the athletes involved to find out first-hand exactly what happened and what impact the injury has had on their career, their psyche, their lives, and we follow them through recovery and rehabilitation. We talk to the orthopedic surgeons, the rehabilitation specialists and human performance engineers who help rebuild the athletes. For some competitors that means the opportunity to play another day; for others it means the chance at living a normal life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119827</url></doc>
