<plot>In the past the ocean god Tikoruru set the Waitapu, a border on the horizon which should not be approached by common people. The witchdoctor Tefoto has forbade to even look towards the direction of the line. But the young fisherman, Iteo, dreams of approaching the Waitapu. The tribe lives peacefully on the island until the day when an outsider comes from the sea. Even though he brings fear to inhabitants, he is accepted. After settling, he tells Iteo incredible stories, which increase Iteo's desire to cross Waitapu.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645861</url></doc>
