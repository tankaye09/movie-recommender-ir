<plot>Fight For Fame is about five aspiring actors between 18 and 35 years old, from both sexes and all races, and who have ambitions to make it big in Hollywood. Five of these actors are presented each week to a major Talent Agency, Acme Talent &amp; Literary, and their two top agents, Adam Lieblein and Greg Meyer. As the five of them jump through the hoops in order to land representation with this talent agency, they constantly compete against one another in a bid to do so. Whether it be presenting their monologue, ensemble performance, improvisation skills, audition technique, or honestly talking about their dreams of success; This is their story told in 60 minutes when only one out of the five will be chosen, with each person being dispatched by Adam Lieblein one by one until there is only one person left to be signed by the agency.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193788</url></doc>
