<plot>Most people in life can either claim to be attractive or clever, a lucky few may greedily boast of both, however life hasn't been that kind to Maud, it has been positively mean. Poor unfortunate Maud was not blessed with good looks or intelligence. Living her life in a daydream is her only comfort, wishing her time away by dreaming of romance and babies accompanied by a soundtrack of her 80's pop star pin up Nigel Savage. Having successfully engineered her impregnation, Maud gleefully awaits the day when her dreary life will be brightened by her much longed for offspring. However the happy day gets off to a bad start when a chance encounter with her poster heart throb and object of her affections, Savage turns out to be far less than her knight in shining armor. Dejected and heart broken Maud does not have time to wallow as her dreams of motherhood are about to be realized.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039136</url></doc>
