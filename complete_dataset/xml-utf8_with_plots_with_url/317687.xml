<plot>A young deaf boy named Suni delivers sweets (Ladoo's) for a shop his father works for before he goes to school. He is crazy about cricket and dreams of buying an Indian cricket team shirt. One day at school he decides to steal money from his fathers sweetshop and so he engineers a brilliant plan to keep this money for himself. The question is will Suni survive his own guilt? And what will be the eventual outcome of Suni's plan. His journey takes us into the world of cricket, fairy tales, first love and gives us a glimpse of a society bound by class, money and greed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317687</url></doc>
