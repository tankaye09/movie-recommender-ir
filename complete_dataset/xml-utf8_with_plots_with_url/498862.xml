<plot>We were fortunate enough to secure a most perfect and lifelike motion picture of Sir Thomas Lipton on board his steam yacht Erin. The picture was taken while the races were on. Sir Thomas comes from the bow of the ship, and leaning over the rail, raises his glasses to his eyes and looks out over the course. Several guests on board the yacht are passing and his Sheik servants are seen walking about the deck, busy with their duties. As the great yachtsman lowers his glasses he looks straight at our camera and we secured a most perfect portrait of the greatest yachting sport that ever crossed the Atlantic Ocean in an attempt to lift the America's cup.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?498862</url></doc>
