<plot>Jerry Downing is an aspiring novelist who has an ego problem that is turning him into a monster in his household. He is an unformed, incomplete human being that has flaws in his personality. His ordinary world is one where he signs on the dole, checks-in for agency work and watches television over meals. One of his flatmates, Julia Wells, sees his problem and encourages him to give up his novel writing and find a full-time job where he will meet his other half and become a whole person. He refuses the call to adventure because he has been sacked from previous jobs because as a result of writing his novel during working hours. His other flatmate, Kerry Cerberus - who has feelings for him - invites him to go salsa dancing with her. He declines the offer, suddenly aware of her feelings for him. This is the first test that she subjects him to as an ally. Whilst searching for work, Jerry comes across his father who is also unemployed and off to sign on the dole. This highlights the inadequate role models and male figures in his life that have groomed him towards unemployment. He is the product of his family and community upbringing, and realizes that he has to battle against his own nature in order to rise above his situation. He determines in his mind that he will find a job. Kerry tests Jerry a second time by cooking him dinner. He welcomes the meal, but does not offer any conversation. Kerry finds the experience unsatisfactory, and begins the transition from being an ally to being an enemy. Meanwhile, Jerry makes an ally in a recruitment consultant when he checks-in for work at an agency and secures a temporary booking at a publishing house. Kerry tests Jerry for a third time by inviting him out for a drink. Again, he accepts the offer, but does not offer conversation. To add to her anxiety, he is still unshaven and unkempt looking. The dye has been cast: Kerry is now an enemy and longing for his downfall.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579703</url></doc>
