<plot>Now available on DVD, "END OF THE ART WORLD" explored the most famous 1960's artists in New York City -- Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and others -- on 16mm film, ending in a "Bang!" as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and New York "exploded" in a visual montage that included sayings from the Black Panthers' Minister of Culture, angry examples of Nancy Spero's "Artaud" series, a violin case full of mock dynamite planted in Henry Geldzahler's office by a young performance artist, a count-down from Jasper Johns' number series, and Warhol's silk-screens of an atom bomb. Includes the only 16mm film footage shot at Warhol's opening at the Whitney Museum, surrounded by his superstars; Robert Rauschenberg at work in his studio, making cardboard collages; Michael Snow discussing "Wavelength" in the studio where he shot it, while experimenting with some of the elements used in his art; and other art world scenes of 1970-71. The DVD re-release also features the director's commentary and four additional short films, including "Nancy Spero: A Conversation with the Artist"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178252</url></doc>
