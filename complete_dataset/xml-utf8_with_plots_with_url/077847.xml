<plot>There are certainly some effects of globalization on culture in any developing country. Does the American football represent a good example for cultural interaction? Is it an outcome of globalization that American football is now played in Turkey? Is it cultural development or cultural destruction? Does it mean losing their own cultural identity for the ones who play it in Turkey? Is the English language penetrating into the lives of the people too much? What are the ways to protect the domestic culture? The Sultans of the Bosphorus takes a close look at the cultural interaction through American football in Turkey.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077847</url></doc>
