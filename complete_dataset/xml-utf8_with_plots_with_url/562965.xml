<plot>A shoemaker, who has been a religious skeptic since the death of his wife and child, dreams that the Lord has spoken to him and will visit him the next day. He cleans his shop and prepares for the Lord's arrival, and helps several people in distress. When the Lord does not appear, he is depressed with the thought he has been forsaken, but his Pastor points out that he was visited by the Lord through his good deeds to others during the day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562965</url></doc>
