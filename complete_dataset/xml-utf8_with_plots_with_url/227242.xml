<plot>Tony Baxter has convinced himself he's dying. The headaches, the pain, the paranoia. He's put it down to a brain tumor and he doesn't need a doctor to tell him otherwise. This catalyst is the perfect reason for him to launch a vendetta against a nameless man who frequents the pub where he works. On the unreliable testimony of an old friend, Tony is propelled into a revenge filled mission that takes him across a neon lit London until he attacks and kills the man in a darkened alley. Disappearing into the night, Tony questions his motives and actions but deduces he's not the only person out there who is walking this proverbial knife edge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227242</url></doc>
