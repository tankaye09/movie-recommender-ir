<plot>Ever since she was found in an abandoned boat in the middle of the ocean, Finn has possessed a mysterious light inside her chest that literally glows when she sings. Sidney, the retired pianist who rescued Finn, was drawn to the child by the glow her singing emitted over the water. Now the two live together in Sidney's waterfront bar, the Tycho's Nova. Sidney warns Finn that her glow is the light of pure passion, and to let it shine is to endanger burning herself out.She tries to protect herself by holding back, but as songless days pass by, frustration leads her to hum her song. The familiar tune draws Sidney in, and the fisherman understands that it's time to let Finn go. As a token of love, she asks him to play the piano for her. With a sad smile, Sidney sits and plays the piano to accompany Finn's beautiful last song.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623135</url></doc>
