<plot>Several dozen visually pleasing and emotionally stunted young women vie for the chance to marry a wealthy and mysterious groom. They are made to answer a series of incrementally invasive and innuendo-oozing questions about love, men, dating, rumpy-pumpy, what have you, while intermittently parading around on stage in a series of progressively smaller outfits. All of this, while their individual beauty, poise, elegance, and overall worth as a human being is picked apart by a probably drunken and definitely over-pheromoned live audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655250</url></doc>
