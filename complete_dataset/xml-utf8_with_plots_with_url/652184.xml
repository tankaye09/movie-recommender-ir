<plot>A moving story of one man's drunken struggle to keep control of his bodily functions. Liquored up and ready for action, this poor soul is about to discover that trying to do those normal everyday kind of things are not quite that simple when you are so severely under the influence. But he's not the quitting type. Armed with takeaway food, cans of lager and an apartment full of potentially dangerous implements, sit back and watch the embarrassing and painful chain of events unfold.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652184</url></doc>
