<plot>Raj (Salman Khan) is a singer trying to make his way in the cruel big city of Mumbai. He rescues a girl who has fallen in front of a train, and stays with her when she is rushed to a hospital. Pooja Oberoi (Rani Mukerji), the daughter of a wealthy family, survives but falls into a coma. Her family rushes to the hospital and finding Raj there, assumes that he is Pooja's husband, Romi, with whom she had eloped and whom they had never met. Pooja, who is comatose, cannot correct them; Raj, who could prefers not to. As the family gets to know the pretend Romi, Pooja's best friend, Jahnvi (Preity Zinta) soon starts spending a lot of time with him. He falls in love with Jahnvi, who is regarded as a second daughter by Pooja's family. How can he, or can he flirt with his assumed wife's best friend? Then Pooja revives from her coma and complicates matters by falling for Raj. Who does Raj choose - Jahnvi or Pooja? Raj chooses Jahnvi because he really loves her and acted as Pooja's husband out of the kindness of his heart. Raj marries Jahnvi and Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) in special appearance comes in to marry Pooja.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229829</url></doc>
