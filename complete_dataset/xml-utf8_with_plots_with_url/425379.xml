<plot>This picture shows the disciples in the midst of a large field of corn, each of whom is plucking and eating. The animation is perfect, and the movement of each of the disciples is shown in true representation. Jesus is seen to enter the field. He crosses in front of the disciples and raises both his arms to Heaven, which is seen in the foreground making a most striking tableau.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425379</url></doc>
