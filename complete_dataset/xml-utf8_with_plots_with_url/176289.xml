<plot>The documentary follows the journey of the play from its humble beginnings in 2000 through to its reincarnation as a dazzling television series in 2007. The growth of the play in Embracing Da Kink is paralleled by AnthonyÊ¼s personal transformation from a dispirited, out of work actor to a television diva. The now hit play, 'Da Kink in my Hair began its journey as one of the selections in the 2001 Toronto Fringe before receiving overwhelming success at the 2002 New York Fringe Festival as "The Pick of the New York Fringe," chosen out of 196 productions. It was later asked to return to New York for a special showcase for NBC. Ê»Da Kink then played to sold-out audiences at TorontoÊ¼s Princess of Wales Theatre in 2005. As this production gave an entertaining new voice to several hard-hitting issues, Anthony never realized it would attract such a large and diverse audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176289</url></doc>
