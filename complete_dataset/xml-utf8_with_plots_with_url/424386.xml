<plot>Charlie [Johnny Sneed] comes from a long line of storytellers from Muncie, Indiana. He left his Midwestern roots behind to fulfill his dream of becoming a big-time writer/director in Hollywood - but making it in Los Angeles is proving more difficult than he could have imagined. His most recent screenplay lands with a hollow thud and now his agent [Laurence Rosenthal] has served him notice, 'Bring me something I can sell. Otherwise, pack your bags, Charlie. You're back on the bus to Muncie.' And it only gets worse. The only directing job he can get is shooting wedding videos, his attempts to fit in at a Hollywood party are disastrous, and worst of all, a surprise meeting with Shannon Elizabeth [as herself] earns him a reputation in the tabloids as a sex-craved pervert. Now, Charlie will have to rely on the natural gifts of any Irish kid from the mid-west; a love of alcohol and the tradition of telling outrageously wild tall-tales. Based on a series of short stories by Emmy-winning writer Murphy Gilson, 'Partially True Tales of High Adventure!' is a stylish comedy about life in LA and one man's attampt to write his own happily ever after.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424386</url></doc>
