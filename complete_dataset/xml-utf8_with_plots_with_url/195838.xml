<plot>Martin Dowd has everything nobody would want: A grueling job that earns him no support, healthcare, or spare income, and a lonely life in an apartment where his only company is his dog, Kewpy and his eccentric neighbor Larry. He sees the same faces every day, has the same meaningless banter with coworkers, and always has to dodge his tyrannical boss, Mr. Finnegan. On a gray day that started like every other day for the past five years of his life, Martin is sent on a menial chore to the basement of his office building. What happens down there will change his life forever. In a cold world where no one seems to care, how can Martin survive the dangerous "First Bite"?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195838</url></doc>
