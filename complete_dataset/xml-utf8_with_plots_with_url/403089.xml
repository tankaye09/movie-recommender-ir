<plot>Nurse Maggie is a poignant documentary that looks at the extraordinary life of Australian nurse and 'Order of Australia Medal' recipient, Maggie Sister and the work she undertakes with India's most reviled and outcaste people. The film works on two levels. Primarily it delves into Maggie's chequered past, examines what motivates her, and what drives her to do this confronting work. Secondly it takes a physical journey with Maggie through the most inaccessible and marginalised areas of India. The physical and emotional journeys are inextricably entwined. As the film unfolds it becomes clear that through helping others Maggie has been able to emotionally transform her own tumultuous life and discover a true sense of self-worth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?403089</url></doc>
