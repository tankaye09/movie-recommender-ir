<plot>Kanhaiya lives with his mother in a small rural town in India, and makes a living singing and dancing at wedding, birthdays, and other important ceremonies in the community along with Bhola, a young man who his mother had offered to house and shelter when he had been lost in a fair. The community's powerful Thakur Raghuvir Singh's daughter, Chanchal, falls in love with Kanhaiya, and asks him to approach her father for her hand in marriage. Bhola and Kanhaiya's mom approach him accordingly, but are insulted, severely beaten and thrown out. As a result of this beating, Kanhaiya's mom passes away, leaving him enraged to avenge her death by the arrogant Thakur. When Thakur finds out that it was his daughter who had proposed marriage, he apologizes to Kanhaiya, but gets his daughter married elsewhere. It is then that Kanhaiya meets with Janki, a young woman, living with her mentor, Dayal, who works for another Thakur, Pratap Singh. Kanhaiya and Janki fall in love and would like to get married - the only problem is that Pratap considers Janki his mistress, and will not permit anyone to come near her, leave alone marry her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366373</url></doc>
