<plot>Pornographic Blacksploitation. Quasi, a Black man with a 9 inch tongue lives alone with a pet frog. Since his girl friend left him 2 years ago he has become mute and used by everyone. While playing chess by himself on a park bench he is humiliated by a young woman. He's then sexually taken advantage of by his gay doctor whose nurse hooks him up with her nymphomaniac friend Cherry, played by Briggite Maier, who then proceeds to have her friend Nancy over for a threesome. He constantly dreams of his ex and holds his pet close to a ceramic frog as if to symbolize the meaningless of it all. He walks alone on the beach and stops to stare at a young black couple lying on a towel. The man threatens him and chases him away. He picks some flowers intending to go back to Brigitte's place but when he arrives an orgy in process. He walks along the beach and goes home only to see his ex with a white man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612255</url></doc>
