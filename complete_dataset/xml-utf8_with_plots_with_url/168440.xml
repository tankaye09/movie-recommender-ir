<plot>Each movie has its secret heroes - lighting electricians, scriveners, dolly operators, crane stirrers, drivers, property men, stagehands, and all other assistants. Usually stay in the shadow but without them it wouldn't be possible to make any movie. Cinematography owes a lot to the creativity and devotion of these people, who don't mind working in rough conditions. They just work, aware that they are taking part in something very important. Listening to them is to hear another history of cinema.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168440</url></doc>
