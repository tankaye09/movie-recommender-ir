When Birju introduces him to Kanchan, a runaway, he refuses to have to do anything with her, but when he finds out that her uncle, Shivraj, has offered a reward for her return, decides to befriend her and both fall in love. Kanchan herself notifies her uncle, who arrives, but returns after permitting her to marry Shekhar. The two get married and soon birth to Baabla, and the trio live a fairly harmonious lifestyle. Their idyllic lifestyle is shattered when Shekhar is given a suitcase by his friend, Bill, who eventually ends up dead.
