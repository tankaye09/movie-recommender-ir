<plot>The documentary presents a free jazz collaboration by Western jazz artistes Guerino Mozzola, Heinz Geisser, and Norris Jones, along with the community of Lima Gunung, the Sono Seni Ensemble, and the art community of the Boko, Prambanan and Borobudur temples. The scenes in the film are mostly taken around these three ancient temples. Drawing reference to the "jazz" of everyday life, Nugroho juxtaposes the domestic life of the village communities with the free form musical structure. In essence, free jazz parallels the lives of these communities: They adjust to the natural forces which affect their surroundings and are flexible to improvise when the need arises. Teak Leaves at the Temple is a fascinating piece of tapestry weaving together the diverse cultural influences of Indonesia. Under the masterful direction of Nugroho, this film promises yet again to deliver a breathtakingly beautiful journey into the heart of Indonesia's cultural heritage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?532852</url></doc>
