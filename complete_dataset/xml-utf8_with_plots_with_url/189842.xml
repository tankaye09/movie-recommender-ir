<plot>Rai Bahadur is a wealthy man who lives in a palatial home with his grand-daughter, Pinky, and grandson, Raju. One night Raju gets abducted and is sold to notorious and hideous-looking gangster Ustad, who forces crippled children to beg and steal for him. Raju also gets inducted in this gang, and is taught to steal at a very young age. Years later, Pinky recognizes Raju as her brother and takes him home to grandpa, who accepts him immediately and provides for him with joy. Then a few days later some silver items are stolen from his house, and Raju is missing. Rai Bahadur is shocked and reports this matter to the police, and continues his search for his missing grandson. Is Raju really his grandson? Did he actually steal the silver items?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?189842</url></doc>
