<plot>This was a word association game similar to Password. 2 teams consisting of 1 contestant paired up with a celebrity were pitted against each other. 2 games were normally played on each show. The host would give a word to one of the teams, then the celebrity had to come up with the association recorded by the contestant prior to the show {e.g.: Cut-"SCISSORS"}. If the celebrity guessed correctly in 3 tries or less, the team earned 10 points. If not, the celebrity from the opposing team could guess once for a chance to "steal" 10 points. Otherwise, The Word Revealed with the 1st Letter and deducted by 1 point until next-to-the-last letter for 1 point until the star to buzz-in say the word. The 1st team to earn 100 points and collects $100 won the game and played a bonus round called "The BIG 5". In this round called "The BIG 5", the contestant left the stage and entered a soundproof room while the celebrity named 5 associations in each 1 of the 5 words or theme provided by the host. The celebrity would then designate 1 as the bonus word, the 1 contestant was most likely to come up with. Once this was completed, the contestant returned and had 20 seconds to come up with all 5 words with these associations earning $50 for each one. Originally, if the contestant merely named the bonus word, they would double their winnings in the bonus round up to $500 in 10 seconds. To provide a greater degree of difficulty a rule was subsequently added requiring the contestant to guess the bonus word in order to double their winnings. For the second game, the celebrities changed sides. Contestants can play until defeated or reach $1200 in cash. On December 23-27, 1968... "SNAP JUDGMENT" is formatted to "PASSWORD". Now the Game gives 10 clues to the word for 2 teams or less wins 10 points for the 1st chance and all the way the 10th and last chance clue worth 1 point. After the 5th Word, The Points are doubled. The 1st Clue worth 20 points, 2nd Clue worth 18 points, 3rd Clue worth 16 points, 4th Clue-14 points, 5th Clue-12 points, 6th Clue-10 points, 7th Clue-8 points, 8th Clue-6 points, 9th Clue-4 points and the 10th and Last Clue-2 points. 1st Team score 100 points wins $100 and play "THE NEW BIG 5" where a contestant plays for $500 for 5 words to associate in 20 seconds instead of the bonus word. Play Continues until Defeated and wins $1200.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503082</url></doc>
