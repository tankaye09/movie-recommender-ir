<plot>We have just received from our operators accompanying President Roosevelt on his great tour of the Pacific Coast, a splendid series of films covering his reception in San Francisco. The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 5. President Roosevelt on the Reviewing Stand. This is a great film. It shows the President as he is entering the reviewing stand, follows him to the reviewing position, and then gives a swinging panorama of Union Square, with its immense throng of spectators.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421995</url></doc>
