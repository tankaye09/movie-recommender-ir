<plot>Suraj Kapoor is a single, and wealthy young man. One day he meets with Shivangi, and both fall in love with each other. Shortly thereafter both get married and settle down to enjoy a harmonious married life. While dining out one night, the couple are approached by a male, who claims that Shivangi is his wife, Madhu. Suraj and Shivangi are shocked and ask him to leave, which he does. But the following day, this male, with the assistance of the police and the courts, proves beyond any doubt that Shivangi is indeed Madhu, his wife, leaving Suraj to wonder what made Madhu leave this male, and change her name to Shivangi.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026045</url></doc>
