<plot>Olive runs some kind of boarding school. She serves her charges a huge bowl of spinach, but they are less than enthusiastic about it. Popeye comes by and demonstrates the values of spinach: he feeds some to a tree, which grows huge and sprouts a variety of fruit; he feeds a hen, which lays a dozen eggs, and he eats some himself to resist a prizefighter passing by. The children, inspired, feed some to a couple of sorry looking cows, which grow into vicious bulls, sending them up a tree. Popeye saves them, and they finally dig in.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518783</url></doc>
