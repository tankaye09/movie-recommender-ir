<plot>The camera focuses up close on a series of unnamed women as they talk to their men. In every case, even though we don't hear what the men are saying, we know exactly what line and lie they're pitching. The women, who are desperate for affection and a relationship, apologize, bend over backwards to accommodate, cooperate with every male fantasy, tolerate every male insecurity, ignore infidelities, and pick up the check.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582189</url></doc>
