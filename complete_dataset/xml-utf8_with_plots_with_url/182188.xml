<plot>Showing Esquimaux game of leap frog and the Esquimaux game of snap the whip. This shows several Esquimaux at the game of "Misheetak," or leap frog, which differs somewhat from the civilized game, and is quite amusing, the photography of which is perfect. The picture ends by showing a number of Esquimaux picking nickels from cracks in a board with their dog whips, in which sport they are very expert. In the background will be seen one of their "Topeks," a sealskin tent in which they live during their short summer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?182188</url></doc>
