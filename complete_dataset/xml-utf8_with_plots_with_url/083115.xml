<plot>The god of darkness has fallen from the heavens and the world of Wym will tremble as he rises again. It has been 400 years since the Gods of Wym threw Grimslayer from the sky after discovering his betrayal, and he has been waiting and growing in power, plotting his return and the destruction of them all. Seeing his plan and fearing his return, the gods planted their power into the bloodline of a man. Someday, one would be born who could unite the races of Wym to battle the fallen god. Duncan LaRue is that young man. Hidden in an orphanage for his protection as a baby, he grows up unaware of the battle that is coming or his destiny and power. Suddenly thrust into the fray, he will unite with a party of adventurers. Along with a young princess of the magic wielders, a mighty thief lord, an aged ranger, and a Treefolk mage, he will discover his true potential as he races headlong into the destiny that awaits him. He is the Bright One...the one who speaks with the power of the gods. Based on the fantasy novel "Wym", written by Matthew Sconce, Bright One is a fantasy action movie of epic proportions. Set in an original fantasy world of myth and magic, Bright One will pull you into the story and never let you go. With heart stopping action and epic battles, it is destined to become an instant Box Office sensation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083115</url></doc>
