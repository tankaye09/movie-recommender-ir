<plot>An old woman has a cat, a dog, and a canary. The cat and dog fight even worse than normally; fed up, she tells them both off, then threatens to throw them both out if there's any more trouble. The two then spend the rest of the picture framing each other and summoning their master: first, the dog unleashes a whole box of mechanical mice, which the cat manages to sit on (they carry him right into the basement); the cat stamps dirty dog footprints all over the room, but because the dog plays air raid warden ("put out that light!"), their owner doesn't see them. The dog glues canary feathers to the cat, but the canary pops out of hiding; the cat uses shaving cream to make the dog look rabid. Finally, the canary, fed up, frames both of them; they attack its cage just as their owner arrives, and both are thrown out but, as it turns out, the smiling cat has taken the bird with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241082</url></doc>
