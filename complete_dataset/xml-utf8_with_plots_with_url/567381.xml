<plot>Nefarious jeweler Ramon "Glass Eye" Valdez has scored the biggest cache of diamonds in his life. He's about to pack it in and retire. Ex-con Laramie "Rocko" Sally has different plans. Tailing Glass Eye for weeks, Rocko knows that the only time Glass Eye handcuffs his brief case to his wrist is when he has millions of dollars in gems. Every night Rocko packs his special hammer, machete and mask and waits for his prey in the alley adjacent to Glass Eye's store. Tonight Glass Eye has the polished steel case chained to his wrist. In less than two minutes, Rocko buries the hammer into Glass Eye's skull, wields his blade of death and lops off his hand to retrieve the booty. Little does Rocko know, but on this hallowed night of 06.06.06, dark forces lurk in the shadows. Later, while in his apartment shooting tequila, counting his loot and planning his getaway to Fiji, Glass Eye's hand becomes an animated, demonic servant of the devil, hunts Rocko down and exacts revenge!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567381</url></doc>
