<plot>"The Third Parent" is a short documentary exploring the relationship between Ariana, an eleven year girl, and Marcello, her five year old non-verbal autistic brother. Through incorporating footage of Ariana's everyday interaction with Marcello with Ariana's interview and sounds from her life, "The Third Parent" depicts a day in life of a young girl trying to articulate her difficult situation. Through Ariana's conviction, a desperate cry for action is heard that all siblings of a disabled child can share. Originally intended to be a teaching tool for parents, professionals, and siblings in the autism and disability community, the documentary has engaged audiences far beyond that. Yes, it teaches the disability community about potential problems that can arise in a family with a disabled child, but it more importantly tells the story of an amazing eleven year old girl struggling to understand herself, her family, and her difficult situation as she is about to embark on the journey of adolescence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?595678</url></doc>
