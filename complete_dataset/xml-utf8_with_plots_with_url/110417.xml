<plot>Michael is a telemarketer selling magazine subscriptions. He lives with his grandmother, sends his finished novel off to publishers, and has virtually no social life. One day he makes a cold call (by phone) to a woman named Julie who mistakes him for a pediatrician who's supposed to call her for a blind date - a friend of a friend. She tells Michael she's a hairdresser; soon they're talking daily, and finally she pushes him to meet her for dinner. When the truth comes out, will she be angry? Will he spend the rest of his lonely life with his grandmother getting rejection letters from publishers? Or, is Julie hiding something, too?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110417</url></doc>
