<plot>Susan discovers that she is pregnant but the doctor says the child is not human. It's a pig. Her husband, Mike, accuses her of having relations with farm animals and terribly beats her. Susan lets him tire himself out, then leaves him. When Mike awakes, he realizes what he has done and goes after her. Susan, terribly upset, is on the verge of having her 'child,' and seeks shelter in a nearby stable. Mike is delirious with worry, having absolutely no luck in tracking his wife down. Susan is delirious with pain, now completely in the throes of childbirth. When Mike finally find her, she has given birth to her child...and finally sees Mike as he really is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385658</url></doc>
