<plot>Quite possibly Columbia's most-recycled B-western plot in which a disgraced (by a ruse)lawman crosses the border in order to get in with an outlaw gang and trick them back across the border where they can be legally captured and arrested. Columbia also made this RCMP version as "North of the Yukon" with Charles Starrett and again (although the Mountie stayed on the Canadian side of the border)as "Rider's of the Northwest Mounted." Most of the time the hero was a Texas Ranger going south to Mexico instead of a Mountie going south to the U.S. The wonder is that once in a while they didn't make the hero a Mexican Rurale going "north" into Texas or an American lawman going north into Canada, but 'south' seemed to be the only direction the Columbia writers could work with. In this one RCMP Tim Barry (Buck Jones, who also made two Texas Rangers versions of this one), quits the RCMP (as a ruse)to cross the border from Canada to the U.S. to avenge the death of his Mountie brother at the hands of a gang led by Conyda (Fred Kohler.) Buck seems more at home after he crosses the border, gets into his regular western costume and gunbelt, and sheds the RCMP uniform equipped with a gun with a string attached. Lona Andre, just entering her too-much-makeup-is-never-enough phase,is on hand displaying her attributes wearing a great pair of too-tight Levis.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079665</url></doc>
