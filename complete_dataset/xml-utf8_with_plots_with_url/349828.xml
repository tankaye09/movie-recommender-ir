<plot>Chandan Singh is a farmer who lives in a village called Ramgarh along with his wife, Malti, and two children, Munna and Munni. One day Malti gets molested by three city goons, Jaikishan, Rajan, and Banoo. Chandan intervenes, but is attacked, and Malti is shot dead. The children get separated, while Munna is adopted by a Muslim male named Abba and is re-named Shera, Munni is adopted by a Hindu family and re-named Geeta. Years later the three estranged family members are fated to meet again - this time Geeta is a con-woman, who has a con-man boyfriend, Kishan, who is on the lookout for the man who killed his photographer brother, and believes that Chandan is the killer; while Chandan, who is now known as Chandan Dada, a hoodlum, has been arrested for killing a man named Rajan; while Shera, a hit-man and hoodlum himself, has feigned his arrest, after accepting a contract from none other than Jaikishan - to kill Chandan!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349828</url></doc>
