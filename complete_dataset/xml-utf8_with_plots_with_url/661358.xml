<plot>"This picture was taken after the battle of Las Guaymas, and shows a large number of wounded soldiers embarking in a rowboat from an extemporized dock, on their way to the hospital ship 'Olivette.' A high sea was rolling at the time, which made embarkation exceedingly difficult, and the pitiful condition of the wounded soldiers under such conditions can readily be imagined. This picture is remarkably fine photographically, and has made a marked sensation wherever it has been shown."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661358</url></doc>
