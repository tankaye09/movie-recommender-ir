<plot>am Bauer is a new resident to the aspiring Brooklyn neighborhood of Propsect Heights. His opinion on the neighborhood is an unflattering one; but a common one shared by his socio-economic demographic. However, the fact that rent is cheap is enough of a reason for him to live there and tolerate the slow gentrification of its original residents. Denise Brown is a long-term resident of the same area. However, crime and rising rent has pushed her deeper into the heart of Brooklyn. She wants nothing more than to be able to live respectfully where she grew up. But can both groups co-exist? And would they want to if they could?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573084</url></doc>
