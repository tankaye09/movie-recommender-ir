<plot>MR. D is a killer. A cold, calculating, brutal gun for hire. A rising star in the Mafia, he is sent from his home in New York to the suburban home of Chris and Genie Richardson, to take care of some urgent business. Unfortunately, the mark isn't home and Genie Richardson is left all alone with Mr. D and his gun. What transpires is a talk between a terrified woman, whose life has been turned upside down, and the man who was sent there to kill the love of her life. This is what happens when death comes calling. What happens next, is A Conversation with Mr. D.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008848</url></doc>
