<plot>A record is set in motion on an old phonograph. A man awaits for someone on the platform in a train station. A girl gets off the train and runs into his arms with radiant eyes. It is the prelude to a romantic weekend, marked by the notes of the song "Only You", by The Platters. When the time of their love and passion comes to its end, only remains the sadness of separation, and also the record idles. But what is hidden beneath the girl's enigmatic smile, when she gets on the train, which will bring her back home?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413357</url></doc>
