<plot>With humor and an eccentric approach to oddly meaningful details, Doormat uses lyrical animation to chart the journey of an ordinary household doormat, and to launch into the stories of four individuals who grapple with the question of how to live a meaningful life. A doormat factory owner wonders whether the frantic race to become #1 is slipping his life away; a production manager yearns to write poetry and escape the drudgery of his menial job; a coconut tree climber mourns the estrangement from a family that has disowned him because of his lowly status, and a single mom makes endless sacrifices to give her son the chance she never had. Not your average documentary about India, Doormat explores the metaphysical question of whether the direction of our lives can be shaped by free will, or we are simply the pawns of fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156374</url></doc>
