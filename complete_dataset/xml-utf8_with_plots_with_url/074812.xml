<plot>Reality and dream blur as one is pursued by a hooded figure. Having pictured the face behind the hood, one wakes up in his or her room and obsesses over a person who is still yet unknown. But, when the imagined figure enters one's real space, one is confronted with the same questions people ask themselves in surreal situations. Does reason transcend obscurity? Or does it apply only to the known? An adaptation of the masked man fallacy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074812</url></doc>
