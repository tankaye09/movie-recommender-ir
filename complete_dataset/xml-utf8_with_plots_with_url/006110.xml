<plot>Some of the actors were presenters of clip segments concerning different aspects of soaps (super-couples, turning points, weddings/wedding dresses, character families, villains/suspense, genre history/background, bloopers, issues dramatized on soaps, etc.), while others were couples or friends of the past 'reunited' for the special. At times during the special, certain actors would be introduced from the audience (the primary audience members were made up of actors at large round dining tables, the far back contained soap fans) and they would introduce a clip of themselves that was meaningful or poignant for them. Soaps represented with clips and/or actors included: All My Children, Another World, As the World Turns, The Bold &amp; the Beautiful, Capitol, Dark Shadows, Days of Our Lives, The Doctors, The Edge of Night, General Hospital, Guiding Light, Love of Life, Loving, One Life to Live, Ryan's Hope, Santa Barbara, Search for Tomorrow, and The Young and the Restless.</plot><plot>Some of the actors were presenters of clip segments concerning different aspects of soaps (super-couples, turning points, weddings/wedding dresses, character families, villains/suspense, genre history/background, bloopers, issues dramatized on soaps, etc.), while others were couples or friends of the past 'reunited' for the special.
