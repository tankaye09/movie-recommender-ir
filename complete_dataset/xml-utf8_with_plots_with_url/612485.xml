<plot>Most teenagers row with their parents. But what happens if you leave home while you're still at school? What's it like living alone while you're still a child? At the tender age of sixteen, Tony left home and was forced to fend for himself. He's managed to survive alone for the last two years... but only just! Tony's now 18 and still very much a boy, but he's had it with being unemployed, useless, skint, lonely and too ashamed of his life to go and face his mum. This film follows his journey as he becomes a grown-up, and tries to reconcile with his family. As he begins to sort his life out, Tony makes some extraordinary discoveries that lead him in an entirely new direction. Maybe the family he's been looking for can be found somewhere else - and maybe there's a different way to go home?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612485</url></doc>
