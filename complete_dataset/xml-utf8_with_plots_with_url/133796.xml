<plot>84 year old Oliver spends most of his day drifting in and out of sleep in front of the television. The vivid memories of his past, play inside his head as he sleeps. Oliver's wife Ruby wakes Oliver up from his afternoon nap and he decides to check his email. Used to receiving no new mail, Oliver is surprised to find a new message sitting in his inbox. The message is from Anyim Chijuka, a former bureaucrat from Nigeria. Anyim states in the email that he is offering a joint enterprise, to establish a charitable foundation to assist orphaned Nigerian children. Oliver's eyes light up as he reads the email, enthralled that someone out there is requesting his assistance. Oliver mentions the email proposition to his wife and she instantly discards the idea as a possible scam. Thinking otherwise, Oliver continues to pursue the opportunity, risking his life savings in the hope of making a difference to the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133796</url></doc>
