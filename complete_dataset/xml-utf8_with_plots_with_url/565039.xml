<plot>Cody Keith, a senior high school quarterback has flown under the radar, unnoticed by college recruiters for three years. This year, (his final), is different. After a phone call from the most successful and highly touted quarterback coach in the country, (Steve Clarkson), Cody transferred to a Christian, pass happy high school in Pasadena. Under the teaching of the man who trained ten NFL quarterbacks, Keith will have one final season to prove to everyone (including himself) that he has the ability to play Division I college football. One season to make all his dreams come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?565039</url></doc>
