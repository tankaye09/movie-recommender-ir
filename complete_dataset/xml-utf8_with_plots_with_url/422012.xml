<plot>Here we have recorded a very novel scene, the camera having been placed in the basket of the captive balloon at the Pan-American Exposition. It was then slowly elevated to the top of the Tower, a distance of 465 feet, and slowly lowered until it reached the ground, keeping the Tower in view all the time during the ascent and descent, ending with a very interesting view of the base of the Tower, with crowds of people passing to and fro.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422012</url></doc>
