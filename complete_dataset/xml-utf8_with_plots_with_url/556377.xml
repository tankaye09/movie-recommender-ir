<plot>In 1977, a leading Italian television host invited three actors - Tito Le Duc (a Mexican), Mauro Bronchi (an Italian) and Neil Hansen, a boy from Perth, Western Australia - to appear in drag on his new variety show. They thought it would be the end of their acting careers. It wasn't. In a twinkling of the eye, The Flag Sisters were Italy's hottest act. With countless TV appearances, feature films and national tours, they were high flying and adored, the paparazzi forever snap-snapping at their high heels. They brought joy to millions of fans at a time when Italy was on the verge of nervous breakdown, the Red Brigades and other radical groups bringing terror to the streets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556377</url></doc>
