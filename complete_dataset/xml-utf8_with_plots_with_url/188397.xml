<plot>Hank is an aspiring actor experiencing frequent false awakenings, only someone else is in control during these dreams. Hank's role as a sociopath over a year ago was his most intense role to date and the character hit very close to home with his darkest desires. His compulsions and character study have inadvertently created another personality. Darker, stronger, more sinister and wanting control. On the day Hank is preparing to meet his girlfriends (Jennifer) parents, he makes a visit to his psychiatrist (Dr. Wright) who thinks Hank is finally ready to rid himself of his inner demon. Hanks other half thinks otherwise. Who is in control when the nightmare is awake?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188397</url></doc>
