<plot>This action-packed one hour special is an explosive response to America's hunger for reality-based TV programming. In the wake of such successful TV series as "AMERICA'S MOST WANTED," "COPS," "UNSOLVED MYSTERIES" and "REAL STORIES OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL," it is inevitable that a show that uniquely profiles the "as it happens" hunts, arrests and captures of fugitives-at-large made by professional Bounty Hunters, will be equally as successful.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034678</url></doc>
