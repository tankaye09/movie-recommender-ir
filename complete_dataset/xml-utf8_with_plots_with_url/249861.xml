<plot>Mamta (Navni Parihar) leaves her husband, Vikas (Sachin Khedekar) when she realizes that he has criminal associates, and thereby spare their son, Vishwas, from any bad influence. Mamta's luggage is stolen at the railway station by a mother and son team of thieves, who are subsequently run over by a train, leaving the police to conclude from the badly mutilated bodies, that they are those of Mamta and Vishwas. Vikas is grief stricken. Shortly thereafter he has to look after the only daughter, Priya, of two friends, after his associates kill them. Years later, Priya (Tina Raana), has grown up. One day she and some friends decide to holiday at Mount Abu. Once there she meets with none other than Vishwas (Jugal Hansraj), who is their guide. Both fall in love. In the meantime, devious Bharoselal (Mushtaq Khan) convinces Vikas that his son is still alive, and asks his nephew, Jai, to pose as Vishwas. Vikas accepts Jai as his son. Vishwas gets hired in the organization run by Vikas, and Vikas takes a liking to Vishwas. Bharoselal schemes with his partners to poison Vikas' mind against Vishwas, and they do succeed, by convincing Vikas that Vishwas is actually the son of one of the criminal associates. In the meantime, Mamta is planning the marriage of Vishwas with Priya, little knowing the opposition she will run into.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249861</url></doc>
