<plot>"Dangerous Crosswinds", a feature-length drama from filmmaker Bill Millios, is the story of a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter who hits a career roadblock and returns to New Hampshire, where he was raised, to regroup. Once back, he unexpectedly finds himself at the center of a story unlike any he's covered before-one involving his own role in the mercy-killing of a close friend. The script of Dangerous Crosswinds centers on Harry Toland, a New Hampshire native who has built a highly successful career at a New York City daily paper. As the film opens, Harry has just been fired over a controversial book he wrote supporting a person's right to die. The uproar has proven too much for the paper, which has let him go. Harry, recently divorced, opts to return to New Hampshire's Seacoast Region, where he grew up, to reassess his life's direction. He takes a job with a local paper, The Hampton Eagle, which is edited by an old college buddy. As Harry reconnects with other figures from his past, he learns the wife of one of his former UNH mentors is afflicted with an advanced case of Alzheimer's disease. Though a firm believer in a person's right to die, Harry later begins to question the circumstances of the situation he suddenly finds himself in the middle of. His search for answers leads him on a mini-odyssey of encounters with a wide range of local people from vastly different backgrounds, each of whom knows a piece of the real story. As the clues add up, Harry is forced to confront a reality that he could never have imagined-one complicated by his own role in the death of a cherished friend under circumstances that are much different than what he first imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125980</url></doc>
