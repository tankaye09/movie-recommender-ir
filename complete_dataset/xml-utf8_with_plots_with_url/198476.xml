<plot>Cherry Goode is a 10-year-old girl who lives in a slum of Los Angeles with her bitter, divorced mother and older teen sister Mandy. Cherry is often ignored and neglected by her mother and teen sister, and the only time Cherry does get attention is when she misbehaves or acts bad. So as a result, a bad reputation hangs on Cherry since her mother often does not want to talk with Cherry and instead dumps household chores on her. Cherry dreams of flying away from her lonely life and one day, has a run-in with her mysterious and reclusive next door neighbor, a former actress named Miss Christina (Shirley Knight), who gives Cherry the inspiration to dream of flying and hopes that her fantasy will come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198476</url></doc>
