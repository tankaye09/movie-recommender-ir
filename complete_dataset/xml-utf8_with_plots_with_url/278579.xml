<plot>John's an inventor who's been down on his luck for a number of years. He's had his successes, but mostly his concepts have gone no further than the initial pitch to Glen Bellow. Glen's a man who doesn't suffer fools. He's made a lot of money, and not one cent of it by being nice. He runs a successful patent office, just him and his preoccupied secretary, Susan. This time, John's got something he's sure Glen will like. A product that, if given the chance, could change the world. He's ready for a killer demonstration, but first he's got to summon the courage to ask Susan out for lunch. John's Hand Cream. It just might work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278579</url></doc>
