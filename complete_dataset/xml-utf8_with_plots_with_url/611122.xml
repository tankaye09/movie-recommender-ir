<plot>The sequel to ToeJam &amp; Earl starts off where the first game ends. The two funky aliens have finally gathered all their rocket parts and left Earth for their home planet Funkotron. Accidentally, some earthlings manage to cling on to their spaceship and come along to Funkotron with them. Being responsible for the huge disturbance the humans are causing on their funky planet, the duo set off to clean up the mess. The earthlings come in all sorts of surprising forms, kids running around, construction workers, tourists, and the regular weirdos. You can choose either character, or have two players play out together, as you hit the earthlings with special jars that suck them in, so they cud be transported back to Earth. You meet other Funkotron inhabitants and interact with them, things like helping them find stuff or ringing their doorbell and running away! All these people will help you in getting the job done and preventing Funkotron from losing its funkiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611122</url></doc>
