<plot>This is a very pleasing illustration of the various modes of transporting men and merchandise in that pioneer country before wagon roads and railroads are provided. We show "mushers" (pedestrians) and dogs with packs on their backs, men on horseback, and pack trains crossing a corduroy bridge over Stewart River, a tumbling mountain stream in a beautiful setting of moss-covered rocks and foliage, a most surprising sight to those who have always considered Alaska a land of eternal snow and ice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014187</url></doc>
