<plot>"What makes me happy? - My boyfriend and my music". When Susanna a 21-year-old female Rapper is with the members from her HipHop crew she names herself confidently "MC Suza". The lyrics of her songs are about her everyday life: Susanna grew up in a children's home. She has little contact with her mother since she is in prison. "My mother was a very successful drug dealer", she admits. Nevertheless, Susanna radiates lots of positive energy. She feels the need to integrate into society. Regularly she works in a hotel kitchen. This continuous work provides her structure and some security. The owners of the hotel are like foster parents to her. But Susanna doesn't live a normal life. The lack of trust and security since early childhood make her a disrupted person. 12 month later everything has changed. Her mother is released from prison. Susanna is fired from her work and she split up with her boyfriend. With great expectations she renews the relationship to her mother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457766</url></doc>
