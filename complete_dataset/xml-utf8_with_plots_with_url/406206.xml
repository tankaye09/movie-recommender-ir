<plot>How far would you go for your best friend? A dark, intense story about the limits of friendship. It's the early 1940's and four young men are forced to band together to do the unthinkable for one of their own. Moving forward with their murderous plan, they're all clearly having second thoughts as they venture deep into the woods. As the story unfolds and the truth is revealed, the young men must face an even bigger challenge...Suddenly the hunters have become the hunted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406206</url></doc>
