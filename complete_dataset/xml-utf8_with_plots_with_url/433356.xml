<plot>A sister's breast cancer diagnosis and her brother's need to take action. Highlighting the events that took place during Franke's participation in the Susan G. Komen 3-Day Walk, including the training and fund-raising events in the six months preceding the Walk. It includes numerous interviews with breast cancer survivors who share the wealth of their experience with the viewer. Also included are appearances by local celebrities, athletes and musical artists, as well as informative interviews with health care professionals who explain what we should all know about dealing with this illness. This is the film the doctor should have given my sister before she left his office that fateful day. So I made this film for my sister, and for all our sisters... that they would always remember, "You are not alone."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433356</url></doc>
