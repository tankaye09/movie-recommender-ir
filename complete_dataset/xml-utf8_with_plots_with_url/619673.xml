<plot>Newlyweds Travis and Molly, workers at a Catholic residential school for teen girls in Savannah, discover that Travis' former girlfriend Shula has been abducted halfway around the world. Gradually, their lives unravel as Travis becomes overwhelmed by his persistent memories and concerns. They both seek support and guidance from their old friend Isaac, a magician who hosts a late-night new age radio show. As Travis and Molly struggle with their relationship, student Hawthorne, a Wiccan, attempts a tenuous friendship with bipolar Ernie. Far away, Shula enters into a cautious dialogue with her captor, Ismail. Ultimately, all come to realize that there is no such thing as a casual relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619673</url></doc>
