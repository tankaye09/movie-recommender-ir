<plot>HENRY O!, a feature-length documentary, tells the remarkable and inspiring story of Henry Oliu, a man blind since birth, who has overcome all the odds and made his major league baseball dream come true. Calling upon his love for sports and an encyclopedic memory for facts and figures, Henry hears the crack of the bat and knows if it's a single, double, or home run; he listens for the ball singing into the catcher's mitt and knows if it's a curve ball, fastball, or change-up. Henry is the color analyst on Mega Classica 820 radio, WMGG, the strongest Hispanic station in Florida's Tampa Bay Market. And at his side in the broadcast booth above Tropicana Field, whispering in his ear up-to-the-minute stats and field action only the eyes can see, is the love of his life, his wife Deb. Partners both on and off the field, Henry and Deb walk arm-in-arm through life, having met on, of all things, a blind date. HENRY O! is a journey of humble beginnings and overwhelming obstacles, of faith in the human spirit and endless love of life and family, of sky-high dreams and aspirations achieved, all amidst the cheering crowds and major league heroes of America's favorite past-time, baseball.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235656</url></doc>
