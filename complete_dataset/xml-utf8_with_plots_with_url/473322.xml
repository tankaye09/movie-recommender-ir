<plot>Doris Rogers (Nancy Brinckman), half owner of a dude ranch, as Jimmy Wakely (Jimmy Wakely), "Lasses" White (Lee "Lasses' White ) and Dusty Smith (John James) to help run it. U.S. Marshal Tom Logan (Elmer Napier), posing as a stage driver, is killed during a mock holdup of new arrivals to the ranch. Brenda Amers (Claire James) and Horatio Pennypacker (Alan Foster), eastern jewel thieves, bring their loot to Roy Williams (Jack Ingram), who owns the other half of the ranch as a blind for his gang which resells stolen jewels. Vaughn (Pat Gleason), the desk clerk, re-cuts the jewels in a secret room in the ice house. Fearing he will be caught, Brenda refuses Williams her stolen diamonds and hides them in a bar of soap. Williams, in an attempt to locate the diamonds, kidnaps Brenda and Pennypacker. Jimmy forces Al Higgins (Frank McCarroll), who shot Logan who was investigating the setup, into leading him to the cabin where they are being held. When ranch guest Fanny Vandercop (Kay Deslys) accuses "Lasses" in front of some of Williams' henchmen of giving her a bar of soap containing ground glass, he and the diamonds are taken over by the gang, and "Lasses" is left prisoner in the ice house.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473322</url></doc>
