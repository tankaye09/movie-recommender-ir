<plot>On the evening of October 24th 2005, The Music Box at Fonda Theater played host to "Look At All the Love We Found: A Tribute to Sublime", a benefit concert to honor and celebrate the legacy of one of most influential bands of the 90s and raise funds for those in need. Artists like Los Lobos, Unwritten Law, Ozomatli, Blackalicious, Fishbone &amp; The Ziggens came together for this night to perform this unforgettable tribute. Many of these artists, as well as some surprise special guests, teamed up to perform Sublime classics in jam-session style. Now this magical night can be re-lived with this special DVD/CD combo. The bonus audio CD contains never before heard covers of Sublime hits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341286</url></doc>
