<plot>"A very unique scene showing the method of washing down the streets in Porto Rico and of special interest now that this country forms part of Uncle Sam's domain. This is a particularly brilliant film, perfect in every detail and being something out of the ordinary has proved very successful."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647987</url></doc>
