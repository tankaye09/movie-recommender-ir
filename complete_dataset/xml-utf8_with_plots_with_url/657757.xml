<plot>When people think of summer camp they think of water sports, summer flings and camp outs. What if camp wasn't just tubing and camp fires but competition all day, every day. That was my camp. What would it do to natural winners? Would they be able to handle defeat? Could a less popular kid succeed in this environment? And then there are the kids that just don't care if they win or lose. Would they step up to the plate at all? Most importantly: what does it mean for kids to come of age in a competitive environment? These are the questions I raise in my film 'Win or Lose: A Summer Camp Story'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657757</url></doc>
