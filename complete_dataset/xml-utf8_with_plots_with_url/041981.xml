<plot>Part homage to the silent film era, and part experiment in filmmaking. MacCallum placed two interesting obstacles for himself when tackling this project: 1) There would be no dialogue, or voice over throughout the short, all information the audience would receive is provided by title cards. 2) All footage containing the "Subject" would have a cut every 15 frames (1/2 second) and the visual interpretation of his thoughts would come from stock footage. What resulted was a film which allows the viewer to constantly re-evaluate what they're being presented.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041981</url></doc>
