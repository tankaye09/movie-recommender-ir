<plot>"The Electric Stage" tells the story of a promising rock band from Jerusalem that was active in the late 1960's and early 1970's. They were considered one of the best rock groups in Israel, but their fame died out before making it to the big time. After 35 years, the documentary reunites the band and follows them as they try to record their first album. Their story is a narrative of the short-lived period in Jerusalem, after the Six Day War in 1967, when, within just two years, it went from a dead city to a vibrant metropolis filled with optimism. During this time the varied inhabitants of the city discovered one another, whether they were poor kids from the projects, Arabs from East Jerusalem, or young American students that did not want to miss out on the magic of the city that was known as the - "San Francisco of the Middle East."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555039</url></doc>
