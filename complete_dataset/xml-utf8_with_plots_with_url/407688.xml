<plot>This is independent life: Year One. Meet Danny, a new university 'fresher' who just wants to cut his past loose and get on with his life. However, he's about to get an earth-shattering blast from the past in the form of Shane, his outrageous 'slacker' mate from school. Shane was the 'worst best friend ever'. Blagging his way into last minute clearing, Shane proceeds to gatecrash Danny's entire uni existence and ransack his best-laid plans. Danny and Shane have been friends for as long as they can remember. As they embark on their university adventures, can their friendship withstand the test? Will they even manage to make it to the end of term alive? Sharing the flat with our hapless heroes are the feisty Scarlet and the permanently morose Fred - who has misanthropy down to an art. Fresh Series One sees them muddling through bad dates, worse parties, social mishaps, financial disasters, political coups... and all the other trials and tribulations of life as a fresher.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407688</url></doc>
