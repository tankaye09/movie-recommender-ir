<plot>Cowhand Ken Clark (Ken Maynard) is stranded in Chicago, and tempoporarily takes a job as a sharp-shooter entertainer in a night club, with the intention of getting enough money together to get back to his beloved Arizona. Frank Gordon (Dave O'Brien), while drunk, is about to be rolled by the club bouncer (John Merton), but Ken interferes and earns Clark's gratitude. Gordon gets a telegram from Kay Burke (Eleanor Stewart), the daughter of his partner in Arizona, notifying him that her father, Jim Burke (Edward Peil), has been killed by rustlers. The ranch has a U.S. Army contract to furnish horses, but she sees little hope of being able to make good because the stock is being rustled, and she asks Gordon for his help. The latter is persuaded by Ken to answer her call for help, but Gordon insists that Ken accompany him, and also take his place as his substitute. Ken agrees. He soon discovers that the problems lie with a ranch employee that has been aiding the rustlers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196962</url></doc>
