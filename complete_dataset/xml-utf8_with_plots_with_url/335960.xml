<plot>Life's Waltz explores old age, loss, and love. Betty is a widow who stays active while living at a retirement community. Even with the loss of her husband Ed, she finds joy and purpose in playing the piano, gardening, and making the most of each day. Bob and Dorothy, also at the same retirement community, are a married couple with a unique sense of humor toward old age. After many decades together, they are still laughing about their transition to a retirement community, their current health issues, and their love for each other. David is a 25-year-old inside of a 77-year-old's body. He resists what he feels is the confinement of a retirement home life and instead chooses to live on his own in a mobile home park. By commemorating his wife Kinuko and their love, he offers a profound perspective on dealing with loss and change as we grow older. Through Betty, Bob, Dorothy, and David, we find out that old age is nothing to fear or ignore; we will all grow old one day with a little perseverance and luck, and it can be as wonderful as any other time in our lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335960</url></doc>
