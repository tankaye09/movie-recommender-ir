<plot>"A pretty maid is busy putting a blank record into a graphophone on the parlor table. Mr. Gayboy comes in and kisses the maid several times against her will; all unaware of the fact that the graphophone is making a record of his folly. Mrs. Gayboy comes in suddenly with her mother, and proceeds to show her the graphophone. The fatal record is repeated, and Mr. Gayboy is punished."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010820</url></doc>
