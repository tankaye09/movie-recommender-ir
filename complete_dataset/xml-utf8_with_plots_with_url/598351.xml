All four know each other from college, and Adam and Sean are in business together and are building great success. Annette dies suddenly - not long after becoming pregnant with her first child. Sean goes off the handle and his psychological decline uncovers a multitude of past sins. Adam must save his friend before Sean destroys everything they've all worked so hard for. Sean, it turns out, has been leading something of a double life all along.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598351</url></doc>
