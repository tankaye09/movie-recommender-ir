<plot>Three young men, who are all of marriageable age, gets their hopes up on marriage, when a beautiful young woman comes to live in their neighborhood. Her name is Pooja Iyengar. All three of them try a hand at romancing her, and only one succeeds, that being Raju. The only problem is that while Raju is Gujerati, Pooja is Madrasi from the Iyengar community, and her dad, Shashtri, will not permit her to marry anyone outside his community, leave alone a Gujerati, and proceeds to get Pooja to get married to Prabhu, a young man from the Iyengar community, with hilarious results.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391629</url></doc>
