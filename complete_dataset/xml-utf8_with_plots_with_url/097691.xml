<plot>"Celebrities Anonymous" is a web series that focuses on regular LA girls dealing with the aggravation that accompanies having a famous celebrity ex. These girls aren't quite over their relationships, for one reason or another and, no matter where they are in their lives, the exes never seem to go away. More so than any regular breakup where one can get away almost entirely without seeing or hearing about an ex, these women have to cope with their demons being plastered all over the media in the tabloids, on entertainment TV shows, and the Internet. Celebrities Anonymous (CA) refers to the support group meetings they have where they vent to each other about their lives and the men who continuously haunt them. These girls help each other not buy the tabloids or look at their exes online. Dating in LA can be a bitch but it's a whole new playing field when you shack up with a celeb. Get ready for the tabloids to track your every move.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097691</url></doc>
