<plot>The Unbookables is a feature length documentary about stand-up comics so brilliant yet outrageous, they are ...The Unbookables. What happens when you push the limits of free speech on comedy stages across America today? Comedy's biggest stars retell hilarious stories of comedy beyond the pale and explain the unwritten rules of comedy as we watch these Unbookable comics bend, break and smash these rules as they blaze an alcohol and drug fueled trail across the country, verbally torching the few places in America foolish enough to still let them perform. Witness demented comedy genius at its funniest, filthiest and most perverted! They are... The Unbookables.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597901</url></doc>
