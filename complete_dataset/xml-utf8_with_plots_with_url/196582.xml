<plot>When Susan leaves on a week long business trip, her 15 year-old daughter, Jennifer is left in the care of her great-aunt Claire. Within a few hours of Susan's departure, Jennifer is presented with an opportunity to meet her estranged grandfather, Nick. After a discouraging introduction, Jennifer makes another attempt to connect with her grandfather and discovers a common love of music. Despite the odds, the two connect and start to build a budding relationship. On the fifth day, Nick's condition worsens and Claire has no choice but to notify Susan. Upon Susan's return, an explosive confrontation reveals a family secret that has kept her father at odds for nearly two decades.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196582</url></doc>
