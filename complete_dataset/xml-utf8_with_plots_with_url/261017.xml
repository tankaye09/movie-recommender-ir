<plot>As a train rumbles trough the darkness, an African girl enters the wagon. A young man with a bald shaved head is staring out the window when she puts her luggage in the rack above his head. Except for him and the girl, everybody is asleep. He looks at her. When she looks back he turns his head away. His heart is bouncing so loud he can almost hear it. Love is blind, isn't it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261017</url></doc>
