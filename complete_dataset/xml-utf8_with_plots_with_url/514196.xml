<plot>Years before he became the host of "Jeopardy," Alex Trebek was the host of this popular variety series that featured top professional figure skaters, as well as musical performers. Sort of a weekly version of Ice Capades. The series ran during the late 1970s.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514196</url></doc>
