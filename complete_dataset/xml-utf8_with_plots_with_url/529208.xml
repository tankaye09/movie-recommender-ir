<plot>Picture a boy's face, pressed against a cold window on a train toward nowhere, has small feet stepping down into the desert landscape of a place far from home. It's 1942 and over 100,000 people have been taken from their homes and jobs to be placed in incarceration camps in desolate regions of the western United States. "TAKE ME HOME" is a child's perspective on the Japanese American experience of WWII. Exploring the physical and psychological upheaval of displacement, "TAKE ME HOME" illuminates life behind barbed wire, the secrets of history and the lessons of freedom seen from the perspective of a child. Each moment tells a story: a boy saying goodbye to his dog Benny, a family living in a one room barrack with the winter wind howling through the cracks. Carrying us across the currents of time, "TAKE ME HOME" provides an intimate foray into the Japanese American experience of WWII - a story of exile and endurance as seen through the eyes of a child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529208</url></doc>
