<plot>Paul Peterman has lived his life to the letter of the Good Book. He's given charity, been kind to his neighbors and has never missed a day of church. However, when he reaches heaven, someone named "Bob" tells him that they're not too concerned about who goes up or down anymore. Paul has to solve what's right and what's really wrong in this strange place. A dark comedy with a deeper message.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025139</url></doc>
