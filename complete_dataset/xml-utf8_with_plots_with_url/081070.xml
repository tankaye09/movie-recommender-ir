<plot>A commercial short made for the Bristol-Myers Co. (plugging their toothpaste) that features the characters from the "Reg'lar Fellers" syndicated newspaper comic strip by Gene Byrnes. The plot concerns a boy who has an old grouch for a daddy, runs off, meets a dog and joins a gang of kids. Meanwhile,the old man has a nightmare,where he sees himself as an old sour puss because he doesn't take care of his teeth and gums. He sees an electric sign for Bristol-Myers toothpaste, and that sets him on a more positive course. (The few-seconds of film showing the sign represents the only commercial intrusion in this short).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081070</url></doc>
