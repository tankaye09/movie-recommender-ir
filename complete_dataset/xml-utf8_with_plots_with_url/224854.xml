<plot>June Forbes (Geneva Gray)unexpectedly visits her older sister Daisy Forbes (Christine McIntyre) in the town of Silverforks, not aware that the latter is a poker dealer in the Half-Way House gambling saloon owned by Rod Jackson (Douglas Evans), member of a gang secretly headed by local barber Herkimer Stone (Wheaton Chambers.) With the aid of henchmen Pepper (Carl Mathews), Nolan (Zon Murray), Diggs (Boyd Stockman)and other members of the gang, Daisy conceals her connection with the saloon. Lucky Danvers (Raymond Hatton), who has just arranged a bank loan to develop his Escondido mine, arrives in town and meets Johnny McVey (Johnny Mack Brown)who is seeking his missing cousin Bill. Lucky and Johnny are object of attacks by the outlaws, who want Lucky's mine and who murdered Bill for his money. The town bank operated by Simpson (Frank LaRue) is robbed and Johnny traces Pepper, who has the money, to the barber shop. Because Jackson insists on forcing his attentions on June, Daisy goes to Marshal Wetherby (Cactus Mack) with evidence against the gang. All are rounded up in a gun battle, except Herkimer, who is killed by Jackson. Daisy goes back east with June.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224854</url></doc>
