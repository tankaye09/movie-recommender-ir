<plot>Kevin borrows his best friend Julian's mobile phone in order to call a girl named Amanda that he recently met. But when he dials, he realizes that the phone recognizes the number and already has Amanda's name with it, obviously meaning that Julian knows Amanda. Kevin makes a date with Amanda, but then learns that Julian actually dated and had sex with Amanda, which makes him feel very insecure about the date. The situation results in a number of phone calls with awkward and funny conversations between the three persons, bringing up mixed feelings between Amanda and Julian about their previous relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091099</url></doc>
