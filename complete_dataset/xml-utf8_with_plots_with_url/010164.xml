<plot>An old farmer appears, making an awkward bow, and holds up a large quilt, showing that there is nothing behind it. He then spreads it out, and when he draws it away a bicycle-bloomer girl is seen. They both hold it up again, and when they take it away, a donkey is seen. The next time they hold it up, they produce three girls.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010164</url></doc>
