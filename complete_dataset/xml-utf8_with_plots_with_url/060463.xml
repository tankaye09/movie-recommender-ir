<plot>Jerome Besson is a former heavy weight champion boxer. Francis Besson wants desperately to win the approval of his father by following in his footsteps. Francis ghettoizes his chances in the legit boxing world by coming out of the closet and has to fight in an underground fight club called the "arena". Jerome believes the Arena has caused his son's gayness to evolve and wants him out and will not lend his support. Carrie Cain Sparks delivers a sensitive and powerful performance as Egypt, the strong willed daughter who is her brother's fight manager. Sparks is perfectly cast in Bashing, because as Egypt is at the center of every conflict, so Sparks' stellar talent elevates every other performance to outstanding levels. Priscilla is a rich artist and fight fan who puts her sights on Francis. Egypt is determined to keep her out. Although Priscilla is White and Francis is Black, the father's wish to change his son's image prompts Egypt to finally let her in. Rockwell is a fight fan who becomes addicted to the arena. He gets set up with an Asian kung fu master who at first glance appears easy to beat. Though the Bessons fight in the ring and out, even with love, every family fights. Bashing focuses on young men's dreams to make it in the real fight world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060463</url></doc>
