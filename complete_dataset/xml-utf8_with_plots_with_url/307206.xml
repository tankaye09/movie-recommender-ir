<plot>La Clave is a fascinating musical documentary film about the similarities between two types of music genres known as Salsa and Reggaeton. In this film, we were fortunate enough to have gathered the hottest stars of reggaeton as well as the old school greats of salsa. We have interviewed salsa icons such as Wilie Colon, Ruben Blades, Ismael Miranda, Gilberto Santa Rosa and on the reggaeton side we interviewed billboard chart topping artists such as Julio Voltio, Tego Calderon, and Hector "El Father" just to name a few. These artists all came together with the same purpose, to discuss how two different styles of music can have so much in common and how their music is all composed under "La Clave". La Clave is the five-note two-bar rhythm pattern which generates rhythmic measurement and is the foundation and backbone of Salsa. We also take you on an extraordinary journey back in time to the root that influenced all of these different types of music, which is AFRICA and its rhythm of drums and percussion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?307206</url></doc>
