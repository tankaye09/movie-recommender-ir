<plot>War doesn't just affect those fighting overseas. It takes a toll on those waiting back home. Coming Home Alive is the story of a prisoner of war that survived starvation and dodged bullets to find his way back home to his wife and unborn child. Awarded Best Human Interest Documentary in the Los Angeles show of the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival, this film captures the incredible strength of the human spirit in a personal journey through war. This emotional story is told by Adams New York resident Rishel "Rick" White and his wife Shirley.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112122</url></doc>
