<plot>Aiden is a former Wall Streeter, who wasn't cut out for the ruthlessness of "Corporate America". He now spends his days taking in all that he had missed out on. His life is forever changed when he meets Fiona, a free-spirited girl, who's recently been fired from her job as a puppeteer. She's now making good by taking Polaroids, sketching and playing in hockey themed punk band. Now that their paths have crossed, they're both troubled by the same question, "What will I do without you?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013909</url></doc>
