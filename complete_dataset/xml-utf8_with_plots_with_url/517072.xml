<plot>For the first time in more than a decade, Joan Rivers is returning to host her own talk show. Featuring Joan unleashed with a trio of male sidekicks (rumored to include syndicated gossip columnist and comedian Billy Masters), "Joan Rivers: Can We Dish?" will blend her trademark outrageousness with a sophisticated and topical take on the latest pop culture news. From politics to Hollywood, personal interest stories to fashion, Joan and her crew will take on one hot-button issue after another in front of their studio audience. Celebrity guests will also join the mix to offer their two cents on the topics that everyone has been talking about during the past week. The end result will be a free-flowing and fabulous discussion that is entertaining, enlightening and designed to feel like the world's hippest and funniest water-cooler discussion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517072</url></doc>
