<plot>A freak lived his entire lifetime closed down in a cellar far in the country. But one day the Monkey Boy, after the death of his "keeper", an old lonely woman, is forced to explore the world outside. The story is set during one night only, a short time to discover the world, but enough time to find Agata, an autistic young girl, the only creature that seems to be able to communicate with him in that dark night full of weird lonely and unhappy characters called human beings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375674</url></doc>
