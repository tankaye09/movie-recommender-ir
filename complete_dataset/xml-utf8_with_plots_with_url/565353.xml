<plot>A multicultural dance studio, Planet Funk Academy, located in an upper-class Houston neighborhood, must fight a campaign to shut it down at City Hall. In the heart of the film, the fireworks are set off by real life confrontation between Dancers and City Council personnel in dramatic courtroom like settings. Amazing dance scenes, from hip-hop to ballroom are integrated throughout the film, as heartfelt stories from the dancers themselves vividly portray their struggles to prevail against overwhelming odds of cultural differences, powerful enemies and the city legal system itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?565353</url></doc>
