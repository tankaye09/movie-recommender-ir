<plot>Jim Fallon (James Ellison as Jimmy Ellison) is summoned to Rim Rock by Hugh Delaney (Ray Bennett), an uncle he has not seen in years. Delaney wants to inform Jim that he has located Jim's elderly father, Pop Fallon (Stanley Andrews), who is blind, and that a young imposter who calls himself Jimmy Fallon (Rand Brooks)has established himself as Pop's son. Pop owns a rich gold mine and is cared for by his housekeeper Martha (Florence Lake.) Jim's pal Johnny (Johnny Mack Brown) accompanies him to Rim Rock. Before they can hear Delaney's story, Delaney is badly wounded as he and two miner friends, Ed Roper (Robert Bray) and Shealey (Stanley Price), hold up the stage and take a shipment of gold from the Fallon mine for the third time. In Rim Rock, neither Pop nor Martha believe Jim's story about Jimmy being an imposter. Jimmy is actually the son of Rim Rock storekeeper Pete Ingram (I. Stanford Jolley) who had waited for years to present Jimmy as Fallon's son and get control of Fallon's fortune.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355312</url></doc>
