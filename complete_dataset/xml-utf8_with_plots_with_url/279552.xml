Shalini is a poet, one day while reciting her poetry, she meets with a young man, who introduces himself as Amar, who also happens to be a poet himself. The two of them spend beautiful moments together and finds themselves attracted to each other. Shalini wants to find out why Amar is in jail. She is told in no uncertain terms that Amar is in jail for murder - for killing the brother of his former lover, Sapna.
