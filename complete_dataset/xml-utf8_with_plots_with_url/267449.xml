<plot>Carol Foster, a mother of seven adopted children, organizes a mission to Ethiopia to realize the AIDS orphan crisis plaguing the country. Her goal is to create a children's home for the enormous amount of displaced children. Traveling with her is her daughter Meron, who was adopted from Ethiopia seven years prior. Meron's return to Ethiopia allows her to reconnect with her past, and unite her two families. Also accompanying Carol is a gay couple and a woman who recently lost her adopted child. Their lives are drastically altered by the children, as they travel from orphanage to orphanage. Taking place over two years, the film examines questions of what creates family, what defines heritage, and what we can do to make a difference.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267449</url></doc>
