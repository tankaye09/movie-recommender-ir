<plot>Jonah is a short 13 year old who lives on a South London estate. One day he finds a £50 note wedged in a bush on a road near his home. Realising this is the opportunity he has been waiting for he plucks up the courage and asks Crystal, a 15 year old girl he walks to school with, out on a date - an all expenses paid day trip to his childhood favorite seaside town of Margate. Visiting out of season though, Jonah soon realizes that the town is not as he remembered it, there isn't much here to spend £50 on, and attempting to impress Crystal might be a pointless affair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279090</url></doc>
