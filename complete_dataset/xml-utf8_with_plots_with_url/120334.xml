<plot>A pair of low-level (and not very bright) gangsters have been sent to deliver a small package of drugs. On their way to the arranged meeting point, they accidentally hit a young woman who was running a box-lunch stall by the side of the road. Fearing the wrath of their employers if they're late for the deal, the two decide to pack her body into the back seat and deal with her later. Just as they drive off, however, a young man on a bicycle rides by and somehow immediately knows what's happened. The film is interspersed with flashbacks explaining how each of the characters came to arrive at their current situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?120334</url></doc>
