<plot>Impressionism is not the completion, but the dying of the old art and the birth of a new art, the art of continuously regenerating youth of the painter, artist and culture. Impressionism and Symbolism can be complete styles, or they can borrow from each other and from other tongues. Just as Symbolism embraces the period of Russian painting from Ilya Repin to Boris Grigoriev, so too does Impressionism shine its direct or diffused light on Vasily Polenov, Wassily Kandinsky, and Konstantin Korovin. It encompasses the earthy expressiveness of Philipp Malyavin, the decorative Fauvism of Mikhail Larionov, and the Primitivism of Natalia Goncharova. It also includes those who would later be called Rayonists, Cezannists, Cubists and Suprematists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471186</url></doc>
