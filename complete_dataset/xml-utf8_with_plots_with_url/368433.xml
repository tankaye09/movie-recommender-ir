<plot>The film concerns Michael's decision to reveal his homosexuality to his family. It follows his preparation in coming out by his participation in a lesbian and gay male peer support group. In this session, several of the participants reveal their own actual experiences, both positive and negative, in coming out to their families. An improvised dramatization of a family counselling session with Michael and his family follows. The session is facilitated by an actual social worker, Karen Kaffko, who specializes in such counselling. Each family member is given the opportunity to explore his or her feelings about Michael being gay. The film concludes with Michael's evaluation of his decision to reveal his homosexuality to his family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?368433</url></doc>
