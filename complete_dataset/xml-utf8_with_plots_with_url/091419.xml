<plot>Rae, a self confessed mysandrist and scopophiliac, battles the demons in her mind by making herself the centre piece of a self-devised experiment in voyeurism. Using the virtual reality of personal web-cams, and a reverse gender 'peeping tom' website, she maps the diary of her psyche and exorcises her obsession with video and mysandry, by cam- recording men from windows and stairwells in the night, to then offer up the footage to online voyeurs. One day she dares to target a middle aged man whose appearance begins to trigger visceral memories of her dark secret that compels Rae to the conclusion of her experiment; a fragile equation between confession, exposure and trust.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091419</url></doc>
