<plot>The story of a 23 year old girl who makes a decision to leave her small town life in rural Kentucky for the big dream of a glamorous city life. The film opens as she is meditatively opening and closing the box to an engagement ring; one just received from her boyfriend the night before. She is searching for something more, and packs her bags and her hot rod car and heads out for New York. She quickly begins to discover that all of her grand imaginations may not come to reality as her car breaks down on the way out of town. Determined and bold, she decides to hitch a ride from a stranger, an extraordinary choice that propels her to a whole new destination.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517858</url></doc>
