<plot>Michael Teague, Don Duncan, and Ed Rosenthal all have been victims of the war on Medical Marijuana. Find out what is really going on. People's lives are being destroyed over this battle. Did Michael Teague really deserve to spend two years in prison for a marijuana conviction? Did he deserve to spend 8 weeks in the hole because he was labeled a political interest?Does the government have the right to retry Ed Rosenthal for the same crime he was already convicted for because the FEDS did not like the sentence? Do they have the right to prosecute someone who was given a job by the city of Oakland?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363408</url></doc>
