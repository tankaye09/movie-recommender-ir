<plot>"All aboard," calls a voice off camera and a train engine appears. Then, we're in an elegant room with a chandelier where Paul Tremaine is directing the Aristocrats in their arrangement of "I've Been Working on the Railroad." It's a 15-piece orchestra. They follow with "Road to Mandalay" and a medley of songs one might hear on a Mississippi riverboat. The medley includes "Old Kentucky Home," "Oh Susanna," and "Mississippi Mud," among others. The music includes a few vocals from a trio of musicians.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426503</url></doc>
