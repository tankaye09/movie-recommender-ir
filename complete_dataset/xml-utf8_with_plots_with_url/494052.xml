<plot>"Positively the most wonderful series of pictures ever secured by an animated picture camera. The first scene is taken from the pond of the chutes, and shows a number of boats laden with gay Coney Island pleasure-seekers coming down into the water in rapid succession. The next scene is taken from the top of the incline, showing the boats being loaded, starting away, running down the chutes and dashing into the water. The next and most wonderful picture was secured by placing the camera in the boat, making a panoramic view of the chutes while running down and dashing into the water. Sold complete or in separate lengths."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494052</url></doc>
