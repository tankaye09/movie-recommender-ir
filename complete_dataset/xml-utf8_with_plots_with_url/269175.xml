<plot>Iskateli (aka...'Those Who Seek') is an autobiographical story from the writer Daniil Granin, who worked as an engineer at the Kirov Plant in Leningrad. The film is set after the end of the WWII. The leading character is Engineer Lobanov. He is trying to introduce the invention he made together with his friend during the war. The invention is a leak-locater (device for locating breaks in electric power cables). This is a very important and innovative breakthrough, and it must be implemented in the equipment for testing the cables and telecommunication wiring. His hopes are so high, that he is accepting a pay cut in order to fulfill his dream. But the soviet style bureaucracy is destructive and unbeatable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269175</url></doc>
