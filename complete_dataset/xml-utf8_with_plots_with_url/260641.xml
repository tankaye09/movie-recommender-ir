<plot>This is the story of flying twin brothers who battled school bullies, a pro-gay yellow zogo who knew that boys who liked boys were not weirdos, and American Cowboys in a welsh mining village who helped a girl with both legs in plaster to walk. This is a film about a special kind of friend; a friend who never grows up, who hangs on your every word, who appears just at the very moment you need them, and who represents all the best aspects of you - because you're the one who created them. This is a film about imaginary friends and why an imaginary friend is a better friend than a real one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260641</url></doc>
