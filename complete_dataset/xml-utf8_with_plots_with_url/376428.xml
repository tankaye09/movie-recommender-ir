<plot>Monty Panesar is the first Sikh ever to play for England at cricket. For him, there's no conflict between his religion, his roots and the three lions shirt. Monty For England is an intimate portrait of Monty, his friends and his family - from his selection to his triumphant debut, against India, in the birthplace of his family and his faith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376428</url></doc>
