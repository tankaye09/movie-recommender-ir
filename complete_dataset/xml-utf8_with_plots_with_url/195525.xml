<plot>Fire Within is a documentary film that explores the efforts undertaken by the Jacobs International Teen Leadership Institue (JITLI) to foster understanding... one heart at a time, one neighbor at a time. 30 Teenagers (10 Israeli Arab Muslims, 10 Israeli Jews, 10 American Jews) examine their differences and similarities while traveling through Spain then Israel together. Muslims, Jews, Israelis, Americans, Girls, Boys - all leaders in their communities and all passionate about their future. Journey with them as they confront their fears and prejudices, discover new friends and neighbors and engage in heated debates. Watch as they delve into issues such as religion, equal rights, racial profiling, history, army, identity, politics, constitution and education. Laugh. Cry. Agree. Disagree. But whatever your emotion... pay attention. The world can learn a lot from the leaders of tomorrow... as they have learned from each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195525</url></doc>
