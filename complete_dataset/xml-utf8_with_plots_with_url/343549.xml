<plot>Perry Roberts is about to graduate from a prestigious private college. The son of a corrupt Congressman, Perry has lost faith in all the things he held true - his family, girlfriend, and the American Dream. He finds himself emotionally bereft and depressed. In search of self-discovery, Perry meets Giovanni, an art student with an unrealized gift, Giovanni is Perry's polar opposite. Raised by abusive parents and placed into a series of foster homes, Giovanni is brooding and nihilistic. He lives in an altered state full of drugs and sex, capped by a deadly game with a gun and a single bullet! Perry sees Gio as a free spirit, incorruptible and impervious to the pressures of society. Gio believes Perry to be a spoiled rich boy dabbling in existential angst. Perry needs Gio to believe that his pain is real, while Giovanni implores Perry to play his game of Russian roulette to prove the validity of his suffering. As Perry and Gio's relationship evolves, and drug-fueled emotions churn, their fates linger at the tip of a revolver with a single bullet. Perry sets out on a quest to save Gio. The only question is, is he in time or too late?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343549</url></doc>
