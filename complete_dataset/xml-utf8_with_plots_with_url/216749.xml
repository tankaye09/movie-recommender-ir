<plot>What's the worst crime that can be committed in a pub? Trying to steal another person's boyfriend or girlfriend is bad, but spilling someone else's drink is much, much worse. This terrible mistake could lead to all sorts of, often violent, trouble. Glasgow Kiss is a perfect example of the dangers faced by unknowing drinkers every week in crowded bars up and down the nation. In a pub an elbow is accidentally jogged and, horror of horrors, some beer is spilt. The resulting brawl takes on an unusual, highly painful form for its macho protagonists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216749</url></doc>
