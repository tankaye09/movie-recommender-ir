<plot>In the Ivory Coast, Ali (Toure) is a poor policeman who struggles to make ends meet for his wife, Awa (Kabore) and three children. Ali is excited and giddy When he learns that the lottery ticket that Awa bought him is a 3,000,000 winner. But after an extended, frantic search he cannot find the ticket anywhere and he starts to neglect his work. As his family and neighbors learn of his good fortune, they start to come to him with their hands out, and Ali is seen as a mark by others who learn of his winnings. When Ali at last finds the ticket, he realizes that he cannot meet everyone's wishes, even with ten Jackpots.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647501</url></doc>
