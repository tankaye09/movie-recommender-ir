<plot>Christopher, a middle-aged man who is obsessed with repairing old radios, marries the Russian bride Natasha. She comes to live with him and his mother Dora in his London house. Dora instigated the marriage in order to have someone look after her son when she dies. Natasha is bored as Christopher takes no sexual interest in her, and she is treated as a servant.
