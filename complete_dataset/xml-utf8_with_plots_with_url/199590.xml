<plot>The fourth in the series of shorts requesting funds from the theatre audience for the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital in Saranac, New York, preceded by the third one which was produced by Warner Bros. in 1938. The major film studios took turns producing these over a long period of years, and all were released and shown during the week of April 20th each year with a major star making the funds appeal at the end. Spencer Tracy in this one and James Cagnet the year before. This was produced at the Fox Movietone Studios in New York, and Eastman House, Dupont-Pathe and Filmex-Gevaert all contributed the film stock. These were made available to exhibitors at no charge. This one opens with writer Robert Sherwood drawing comparisons between Will Rogers and Abraham Lincoln, and then two filmed scenes from the stage production of "Abe Lincoln in Illinois (with Raymond Massey) were shown to make the point. Deanna Durbin and Lowell Thomas were also on hand to make donation appeals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199590</url></doc>
