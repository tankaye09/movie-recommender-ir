<plot>Upon the death of his step-father, Philip returns to his hometown from the seminary he is attending. While doubts about his religious path had already existed, the imminent loneliness of his mother causes him to seriously consider leaving seminary for good. Unable to lend himself to his distant mother, he spends his time exploring his old town, seeing how it's changed. In the midst of his first day back, Philip runs into Alexis, a girl he dated in middle school and hasn't seen since.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?399260</url></doc>
