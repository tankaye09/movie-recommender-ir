<plot>Joe Marzano wrote this description: "A young lady goes to pack her things for the last time at an apartment where she has had a love affair that is now overdue to that final and most jealous of rivals, death. The apartment, however, is alive with memory made vivid by objects and garments in use by the lovers but a few days before."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666621</url></doc>
