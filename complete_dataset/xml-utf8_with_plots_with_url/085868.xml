<plot>'BugWorld' is an educational yet highly entertaining film hosted by the Varmints. These six animals make up the 'Be A Know It All' Team and approach their subject matter from a variety of angles, presenting only the most interesting parts in a funny and engaging format. Their leader, Rex (a lizard with a love of human literature), tries to keep this offbeat group of personalities on-task without stifling the amazing creativity that comes from these intelligent animals. The other members of the team are Kate (a shrew with an amazing grasp of science along with an explosive temper); Colonel (a rooster and resident historian); Irene (a mockingbird who can speak 17 different languages and does an impeccable Clint Eastwood impression); Saul (a lovable possum and master scavenger of the World Wide Web) and Shelvis (an armadillo who claims to be 'The Most Charismatic Armored Mammal Know To Mankind!').</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085868</url></doc>
