<plot>One boring day at work, lowly office drone Bob Zimmer receives an invitation to sign up for a new "interactive reality" version of his social networking site. With nothing better to do, Zimmer agrees. Immediately, the agent appears. While Zimmer pauses to figure out what has just happened, and checks to see if anyone else sees what he sees, the news-feed notifications begin. "You have one new friend request." Zimmer acknowledges his college friendship with John Brown. But when John suddenly appears in the office, Bob begins to realize just what has signed up for. Zimmer's office life and his on-line world begin to collide and the activity around him becomes more and more frantic. Can his co-workers be completely oblivious to what is going on as he is assailed with notifications, invitations, wall posts, group memberships, gift giving and the never-ending poking? Things get really desperate when his co-worker, Derwood, announces that the big meeting has been moved up and Zimmer has to present his TPS report that afternoon! Can Bob possibly get his TPS report prepped, survive the ever growing invasion of "friends" and keep it all from his short tempered, knee-jerk boss Mr. Handelman?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021435</url></doc>
