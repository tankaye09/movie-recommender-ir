<plot>African river blindness is a disease caused by a parasitic worm that is transmitted through the bite of a blackfly. The worms swim under the skin causing an extremely severe skin irritation. Eventually, the worms swim into the eye and scar the retina leading to blindness. Merck &amp; Co. offers a drug that kills the worms and completely treats the symptoms for free, yet 37 million people are still infected.</plot><plot>African river blindness is a disease caused by a parasitic worm that is transmitted through the bite of a blackfly.
