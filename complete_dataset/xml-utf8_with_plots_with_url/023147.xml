<plot>Adam wakes up with a terrible headache and amnesia. His first reaction is to try to figure out where he is and why. Three young people claim to know him, although he does not recognize them. Adam's urge to remember who he is, eventually makes him so frustrated that he tries to escape, only to find out that it is impossible. Due to various religious symbols all around the house, he eventually becomes obsessed with the idea that he is already dead and has gone to Heaven. But Heaven turns out to be a prison Hell, from which the only way out is suicide. But as Adam dies, failing to find out who he is, the audience comes to a new understanding of who and especially what he really is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023147</url></doc>
