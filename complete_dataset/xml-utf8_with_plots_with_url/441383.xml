<plot>One of the most recognizable elements of Native expression is the Pow-wow. But very few people outside the culture understand it. They do not understand the significance of the songs and the dances behind Pow-wow; they do not understand the rites and ceremonies contained within a pow-wow. They do not understand the meaning of the clans, or why Indian people dance. The Pow Wow Trail series will explore the true meaning, beyond the feathers and beads. Culture lives within the people; it is expressed through those who practice and participate in these celebrations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?441383</url></doc>
