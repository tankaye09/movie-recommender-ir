<plot>At an enormous expense we have succeeded in procuring a life motion picture of this giant, who stands nearly 8 feet in height. A man fully 6 feet tall is seen to stand under his outstretched arm, with room to spare. Everyone will acknowledge this film to be an interesting subject, and will admit never having seen its equal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214603</url></doc>
