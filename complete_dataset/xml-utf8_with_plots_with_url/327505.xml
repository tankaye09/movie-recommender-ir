<plot>Eva, a forty-year-old successful journalist, is kidnapped by Laurent, a harmless criminal of 25 who is running away from the police. Laurent wants Eva to drive him to Spain, and, at some point of such an unusual trip through idyllic landscapes, Eva will see beyond the fugitive that Laurent is to find a tender and sensitive man, the ideal father for the child she has never had. With the police on their heels, the couple will meet peculiar people, many of whom seem to have lost their roots, who will help them or make the escape even more difficult. But who is the hostage and who is the kidnapper? Who is kidnapping who?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327505</url></doc>
