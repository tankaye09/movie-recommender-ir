<plot>MORAIG - Lost River of the Phoenicians Moraig is the biggest underwater cave labyrinth on the Iberian peninsula. It is located close to Alicate, Spain. The documentary MORAIG is about Bernhard Pack's project to find sweet water in the underwater river Moraig. Somewhere in the cave it gets mixed with the salt water from the sea. Legends from the Phoenicians tell that this river supplied sweet water a long time ago. Bernhard Pack's vision is to find the spot where the the salt water comes in from the sea. If he would succeed, it would help the people in this region supplying drinkable water even in the driest summers. As a result Bernhard Pack must dive deeper and deeper into the cave, alone. Equipped only with his diving instruments and the camera he enters unknown territory. With the support of his team of German and Spanish speleologists he manages to dive over 1000 meters into the river directly under the coast's rock mass.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376852</url></doc>
