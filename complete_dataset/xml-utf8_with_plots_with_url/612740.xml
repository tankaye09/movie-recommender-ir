<plot>This is a "hit" picture. Toodles and her mamma are shown in a street car. Toodles places her strawberry tart on an adjoining seat while she eats her banana. A tall and immaculately dressed swell comes in and sits down on the tart. Toodles at first thinks it is a joke, but as soon as she realizes her tart is spoiled she starts to cry and shriek. The dude jumps up and, bringing around the tails of his coat, shows the havoc wrought by the accident. A thoroughly funny and cleverly enacted scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612740</url></doc>
