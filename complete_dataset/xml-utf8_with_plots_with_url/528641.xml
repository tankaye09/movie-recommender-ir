<plot>Alone and seething with anger at the loss of his parents Mo Ma must find a way through his insecurities and hatred to become one of the great masters of Tai Chi. However that path is full of danger both to himself and those around him as he fails again and again to live up to the code his master lays down for him. Travelling from his childhood village to the capitals of the east Mo Ma meets friends along the way as well as learning the shocking truths to his parents demise. Socially clumsy and quick to anger he is easy prey to men who would use him to their own ends, eventually causing him to clash with the number one martial art's clan in the country, we witness the effects as they unfold.....</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?528641</url></doc>
