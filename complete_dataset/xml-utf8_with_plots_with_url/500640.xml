<plot>The Pink Panther decides to construct and fly a kite, and a dog promptly jumps right through it. The panther rebuilds his kite and attempts to fly it, and, as usual, the problems begin for a little, pointy-nosed man, who in this cartoon is a home-owner. Capping an increasingly destructive series of accidents, the panther's kite tracks through the little man's barbecue and catches fire. It lands on the man's house and sets it ablaze. Within seconds, the house is reduced to smoldering rubble. The man goes ballistic and flies a biplane Red Baron-style in a vengeful attempt to shoot down the Pink Panther, who is soaring through the air in his new, wing-sized kite.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?500640</url></doc>
