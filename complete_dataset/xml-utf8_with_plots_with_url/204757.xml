<plot>In The Forgotten Relic, Frogger's beloved grandfather has suddenly vanished without a trace. Frogger is determined to find him, and he sets out on a dangerous frog hunt through 18 unique, puzzle-filled environments. In your search, you will happen upon a piece of ancient technology called OPART--a magic system that allows you to use a range of magical moves including warp, time stop, grappling hook, and more. The Forgotten Relic also features RPG elements and a four-player mode that only requires one game cartridge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204757</url></doc>
