<plot>Based on ancient middle eastern fairy tales written thousands of years ago, and passed down from generation to generation. Imad's beautiful true love (Amina) is snatched in the middle of the night right from her dream in which Imad shared with her, by an all mighty Djinn (evil Genie). Imad, only empowered by the pure energy of love and passion for her, finds himself having to cross 'the three valleys of the black desert', which are represented as the 'three vises of man' (Fear, Greed, and Lust) which come at him in different forms and are represented as both external and internal demons. Guided only by a fortuneteller and an angel, Imad must overcome these vises, in order to prove the purity of his soul and reach the 'Tree of Life'. No man has been able to achieve this, but he must, to save what matters most, his true love Amina from the supernatural Djinn.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152852</url></doc>
