<plot>Miss Susan was a tearjerker about Susan Martin, a lawyer with a spinal cord injury, who returns to her hometown of Martinsville, Ohio. When she arrived she learned that Laura, the family housekeeper had been charged with theft. The prime story line centered around Susan's love for Bill Carter and whether it would last, due to her now being paralyzed. Susan Martin was played by Susan Peters, who had became a paraplegic in 1945. She died in 1952, a few months after the series was cancelled.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372290</url></doc>
