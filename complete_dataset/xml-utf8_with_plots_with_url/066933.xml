However, the private eyes Sam Slade hires the team to help him in a security work in a party in the house of the famous star Lola Daville, whose secretary Miss Green has just hired him for the protection of a valuable necklace. When the jewel is stolen in the party, Betty Boop becomes the suspect number one, since the criminal left his gun in her hands during a blackout, and Sam is unable to prove her innocence wounded in the hospital.
