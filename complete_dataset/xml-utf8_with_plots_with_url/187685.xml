<plot>Everything was going just fine, and then it happened: Hank Green finally exploded. Every light on the switchboard lights up like fireworks at 98.2 KJKL "The Jackal!" Talk Radio. LA's most outlandish talk-show host erupts on the air, assaulting a half-witted caller with the most offensive insult ever uttered by man. The door skyrockets open as the FCC's most vicious agent with a comb-over bursts onto the scene, hell-bent to shut down the station for good. Jason, the young host of "The Jack and Jason Show" has to hold it all together (if he can stop popping pills long enough to stay awake, that is). It all blows up in his face as the Titanic finally sinks-but at least he's got treats: free-flowing laxatives, turrets mixed with opera, the local shrew getting her groove back, a chance to ghostbust the station's resident spook, and the gross misuse of Naranja Spray Tan. It can only mean one thing: hilarious disaster.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187685</url></doc>
