<plot>Eldorado, true to its name, is one of the richest creeks in the golden North. It has probably made more millionaires out of poor men than any one gold stream in the world. This view shows all phases of operating a claim of this description; loading in the pit the dump buckets which are hoisted to the "mad box" where the pay dirt is dumped and shovelled into the sluice boxes. The action of the water on the conglomerate mass disintegrates it, and causes the heavy particles of gold to seek the bottom of the boxes between the "riffle boards" and washes away the lighter rocks and minerals. The heavier rocks are thrown out by hand. This claim is said to net about a quarter of a million dollars annually.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421943</url></doc>
