<plot>Bobby is the voice of pulpy detective serials on audio, as well as the automated answering service of a tree cutting company. One day, when walking his dogs in the Pasadena arroyo, a bottle falls from the sky, almost hitting him. Bobby decides, based on the obscure brand of beer, to trace down the culprit. As he goes about the self-acknowledged specious mission, he is lost in thought about a current probe on Mars, how his detective alter-ego would go about the beer bottle case, and finds himself in the center of a much weirder tale than he originally imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425881</url></doc>
