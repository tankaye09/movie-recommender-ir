<plot>Widowed Gayetri Naik lives a very wealthy lifestyle along with her slacker, alcoholic, and womanizing son, Umesh. She tries in vain to reform him. Then one day he has an accident and is assisted by a young woman, Durga Deshmukh. Gayetri persuades Durga to wed Umesh, and after an initial refusal, she successfully gets them married. Umesh seems to have improved considerably and is obviously in love with Durga. Satisfied with these turn of events, Gayetri decides to embark on a Tirath Yatra, and occasionally keeps in touch via telephone. Weeks later when she returns nothing is the same anymore, and she will end up making life-altering decisions about both Umesh and Durga.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472765</url></doc>
