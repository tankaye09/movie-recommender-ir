<plot>'Rest Stop' tells the story of Danny, a young medic who has gone to Northern BC to get a job that isn't there when he arrives. As he makes his way home, passed by car after car on the highway he takes refuge in an abandoned rest stop. When Edgar, a businessman, drives up Danny thinks he has a chance to get home but Edgar refuses to help him. He drives away leaving Danny even more miserable than before, until Danny realizes Edgar has left his wallet behind, thick with bills. Danny takes it with little thought for the consequences, however when Edgar realizes he has left his wallet, he returns to the rest stop and it is obvious who has stolen it. He takes his anger out on Danny, choosing to beat him up rather than simply take his wallet back and leave. During the fight he trips, hits his head and stops breathing. Now, to relieve his guilt and regain his self-respect, Danny must save Edgar's life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461133</url></doc>
