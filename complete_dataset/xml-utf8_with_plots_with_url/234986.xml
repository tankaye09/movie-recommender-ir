<plot>HELLDRIVERS takes us to the inner world of the traveling daredevil, performers of live car crashes and intense precision driving. Inside the 55-year career of Nova Scotia stunt driver Paul Riddell, and his family, we uncover the helldriver secrets, fears, history and creativity. We feel the wild heart of this family and their devotion to a dangerous profession that has outlived its time. The Riddell family: Paul, wife Toby, and their children Derrick and Ashley, are virtually addicted to preserving the helldriver traditions. As the end draws near, will they turn their strength and courage to leaving it behind forever?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?234986</url></doc>
