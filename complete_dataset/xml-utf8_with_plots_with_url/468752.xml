<plot>Jake is screaming with anger, his arms are swinging, his strides are lengthening, his face is full of hate. Tiny beads of sweat are building upon his forehead. He storms past house, tree and person, with only one thought going around and around in his head. His beloved, the one to whom he has devoted the last four years of his life has deserted him, and not only this, but she has left him for his truest and closest friend - Mike. Jake arrives at Mike's house and pummels his hand against the door ready for nothing but confrontation. Mike, awoken by the excruciating din, rushes down the stairs to see what is going on. When he opens the door he finds only his friend's knife like eyes on the other side. But with this very first exchange both realise that they are about lose more than they bargained for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?468752</url></doc>
