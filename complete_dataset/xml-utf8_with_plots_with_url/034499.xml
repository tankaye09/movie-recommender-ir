<plot>In the tradition of "America's Funniest Home Videos", this show presented tapes of pets and other animals doing entertaining and amazing things. Along with home videos of pets sent in by viewers, the show also took a look at some incredible zoo and working animals, with trainers and caretakers there to teach viewers how the animals lived and what they did.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034499</url></doc>
