<plot>To mark his 21st anniversary in broadcasting, the commentator Darcus Howe picks up on his chosen topic for another piece of work; racism. However, when Howe came to England "racism" was something that all ethnic groups faced from white people and it bonded the community together. Now Howe travels to the Midlands and several other areas of England to find that racism is rife within the ethnic community. He interviews those within the West Indian, Indian, Pakistani and Somalis communities to find that they are split with hatred and racism views of one another bringing the communities to the boil.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655288</url></doc>
