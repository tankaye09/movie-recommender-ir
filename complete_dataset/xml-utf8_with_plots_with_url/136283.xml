<plot>Martin Gutierrez seeks revenge for the murder of his young daughter. The heinous crime was committed by Daniel Michalski, a repeat offender that has slipped through the cracks of the system and is currently on the run. Fed up with the justice system's flaws, Gutierrez takes the law into his own hands and soon ends up face to face with his nemesis. He's determined to exact revenge for the untimely death of his only child, yet as he witnesses the humanity in front of him, he finds himself second guessing his mission. With justice at his fingertips, Martin finds himself in an internal struggle as he's a devout Roman Catholic and deeply committed to his faith. As he struggles with what he's done, he becomes undone and even questions his faith in God... Thou shall not kill, but can taking life be justified in certain circumstances? Are there ever any coincidences in life? How thin is the line between the light and the dark, the good and the bad, the angel and the demon? And finally, with Martin now truly lost who will become his angel and save him?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?136283</url></doc>
