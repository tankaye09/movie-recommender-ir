<plot>Shedding Skin follows the struggles of Jack, a gifted poker player and suicidally depressed young man. Jack is lost. Jack is depressed. Jack tries to kill himself. But for a number of reasons, some clear, some not, he's unsuccessful. In an attempt to cheer him up Jack's two best friends lead him on a drug-addled journey through poker rooms, clubs, house parties and even the courtyard of a local Church, but when that leads nowhere he turns to the advice of two unlikely gurus. Told in a somewhat circular, non-linear fashion meant to mirror Jack's interior life, the film superimposes the philosophy of Albert Camus and Zen Buddhism in the form of the counseling Jack receives from the gurus as he searches for some purpose to define his life. When Jack meets Sera, things seem to be looking up. But just as Jack finally finds a positive outlet for his energy and the film reaches its climax, he begins to question Sera's intentions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491841</url></doc>
