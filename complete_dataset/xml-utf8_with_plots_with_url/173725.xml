<plot>General Info: "El Show" as the staff called it, was the first national, bilingual talk and sketch-comedy show. Opening with a monologue, Paul went on to interview a cross-section of English and Spanish-speaking luminaries from Cesar Chavez to Jack Lemmon. Sketch comedy was interwoven into many shows. "The Father of Chicano Music", the legendary Lalo Guerrero, served as Paul's co-host for the final season. (Lalo's oldest son, Dan Guerrero, also served as the show's head producer.) The show was canceled at the peak of its popularity when the station realized it could import a show from Latin America at a fraction of the cost of producing in the U.S. The entire bilingual staff loved working on "El Show". Paul proved himself to be a generous and kind person, a marvelous talk show host and talented sketch comedy character actor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?173725</url></doc>
