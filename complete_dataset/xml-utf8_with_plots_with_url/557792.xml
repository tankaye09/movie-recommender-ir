<plot>Shows five Irishmen hard at work drilling. The twelve o'clock whistle blows and they immediately drop their tools. One of the laborers seats himself upon a keg labeled "dynamite," and with his pail between his knees begins to eat his dinner. He stows away huge slices of bread and meat, with very funny facial expressions. Having finished his meal, he lights his pipe for a quiet smoke. Satisfied that his pipe is well lighted, he unthinkingly drops the match into the dynamite keg. A terrific explosion follows. A great cloud of smoke bursts from the keg and the Irishman goes up into the air like a shot out of a gun. As the smoke clears away, the Irishman is seen falling heavily to the ground on a heap of rocks. His comrades rush to him, and begin examining him, when he jumps to his feet, knocks them right and left and rushes from the scene in terror. A sidesplitter from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557792</url></doc>
