<plot>After years of peaceful existence on the distant planet Valorie, Questar and his people were forced into battle. While fleeing from the Rulon Armada in a space cruiser, Questar ordered their STEP crystal into activation, in a desperate attempt to flee;the power of their STEP (Space-Time Energy Projection) crystal ripped a hole in the fabric of time, sending them back through time and space to prehistoric Earth. Unaware that at the same moment as their time jump, a tractor beam was attached from the Rulon's flagship, which caused it to make the jump with the Valorian ship. The evil emperor Krulos now plots to capture the STEP crystal, with his own grotesque Rulon forces. Each side uses their own methods for controlling/making friends with the Dinosaurs, the Valorians with their telepathic amulets, and the Rulons with their Brain Boxes. And so, the battle continues, in a new place and time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150747</url></doc>
