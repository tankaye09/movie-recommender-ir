<plot>Form Labor Secretary Robert Reich looks at two classically American industries and how the changes in global manufacturing are impacting those industries and the American workers who make their living within them. In the first hour, Reich examines the "rag" trade and how America's once vibrant manufacturing of clothing has moved overseas and south of the border to countries and workers who are paid far less to sew the newest fashions available to Americans. In the second hour, Reich turns his attention high-tech, looking at aircraft manufacturing, and the competition is slowly eating away at what was once a virtual monopoly for Boeing corporation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350891</url></doc>
