<plot>Beth gives Dave one last chance to prove he can be the boyfriend she needs, even though she has emotionally moved on. Dave has a plan, Beth will love him again or she's dead. The weekend is further complicated by an escaped mental patient screwing up Dave's plans. Maybe. Now the couple has to get away from each other as well as survive the cold night with an ax-wielding maniac outside. Someone won't see daylight. It's just another weekend with the old battleaxe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213488</url></doc>
