<plot>This shows Mrs. Taylor getting into the barrel, which is then placed in a boat and taken out to where it catches the current of the Horseshoe Falls and after being set adrift, is seen going over the falls. A very interesting picture, giving a good idea of the dangerous trip.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380397</url></doc>
