<plot>If the music industry is considered ruthless, manipulative and cutthroat, these terms certainly do not apply to A.J., the most popular singer/composer New York has ever seen. However, if prodigious talent, passion, and attitude are considered synonymous with the music industry, then Reggi fits the bill. Young and hugely talented, he hungers and craves for A.J.'s spot at the top. Into these lives enters two women: the aspiring singer Ruhi and the ambitious P.R. professional Sheena. Ruhi, while she has much professional respect for A.J., she has been wooed and won over by Reggi. Sheena, on the other hand, holds a grudge against Reggi because, while she did a lot for him as a PR, he had rejected her in a personal relationship. As A.J. and Reggi face off against each in a do or die battle, envy and betrayal rear their ugly heads, and talent struggles to survive the onslaught of a carefully orchestrated smear campaign... Music will be the ultimate winner... and loser... in SHAKALAKA BOOM BOOM!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490112</url></doc>
