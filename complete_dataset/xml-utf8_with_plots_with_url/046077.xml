<plot>Jackson, a chronically depressed old-timer with a heart condition, self-medicates with daily trips to his favorite watering hole. Drinking is his only way to cope with the disappointment of a sad-sack life and an estranged wife. When he learns that his condition is terminal and he has only days to live, he meets Brooke, an equally lost and lonely, twenty-something vixen who makes him an offer he simply can't refuse. What begins as an invitation to spend the potentially final day of his life with a sexy temptress, turns into a heart-stopping adventure that will leave them both, and the audience, gasping for air.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046077</url></doc>
