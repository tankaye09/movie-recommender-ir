<plot>HOPE IN A SLING SHOT is a hard-hitting documentary about the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is a film about power and control, exploitation and dispossession, injustice and persecution. Through dynamic maps, statistics, interviews (with lawyers, ex-prisoners, Israeli soldiers, wounded teenagers, farmers and settlers) and the personal experiences of the filmmaker just what is happening to Palestinians and their human rights as their daily lives and opportunities are increasingly restricted by the actions of Israeli soldiers and civilians. The film also explores the way in which the United Nations and other countries are unable - or unwilling - to halt these incursions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245389</url></doc>
