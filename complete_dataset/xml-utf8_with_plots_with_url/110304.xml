<plot>Cohen is pacing up and down in front of his store waiting for a customer. After vainly looking up and down the street Cohen enters the store. A tramp now appears on the scene, clothed in rags, and admires the fine clothes which Cohen has for sale outside his establishment. Cohen steps out and seeing the poor tramp, shivering with cold, offers him an overcoat. The tramp tells him he is broke. An idea strikes Cohen and he re-enters the store. He immediately comes out with a fine new coat which he assists the tramp to put on. After thanking Cohen the tramp goes on his way. The reason for Cohen's charity appears in an advertisement on the tramp's back, "Go to Cohen's for clothing, Baxter Street."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110304</url></doc>
