<plot>If all you know about baseball is that the home team bats last, you know about Wrigley Field - the ballplayers who romped there, the famous announcers, the ivy-covered walls. But "beyond the ivy" there's another side - the game surrounding the game. Where a devoted fan builds a model of the ballpark too large to move out of his house. Where a man spends every day outside the park determined to catch home runs. Where a scalper plays cat-and-mouse to sell you a ticket to a sold out game. "Wrigley Field: Beyond the Ivy," takes you from the rooftops to the bleachers and back down to the streets where odd and obsessive characters turn a day and night at Wrigley Field into a truly unique experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661554</url></doc>
