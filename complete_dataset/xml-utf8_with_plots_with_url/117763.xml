<plot>This film is an in depth look at the accomplishments and self destruction of Hollywood party crasher Michael Minutoli. From the Academy Awards to the Grammy's to countless movie premieres and concerts, Michael has crashed hundreds of events in order to experience the dream of rubbing shoulders with all of our favorite celebrities. But this real life fantasy has taken a toll on Michael's personal life, leaving him homeless and without a family. Testimony from Michael's friends, co-workers and family describe the impact that this obsession has had on his life and the lives of his family while Michael himself takes us on a night of Hollywood party crashing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117763</url></doc>
