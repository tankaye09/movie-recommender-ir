<plot>"Burt Luddin's Love Buffet" was a short-lived rehash of "The Newlywed Game," which attempted to marry the rules from that often-imitated game show with situation comedy elements; the game took place in a Las Vegas-style setting. During the game element, host Luddin asked the couples questions about their love lives and relationships, with correct matches worth points. The couple with the most points after three rounds played a bonus round. In the bonus round, the partners were seated on opposite sides of a wall (inside a cubicle shaped like a heart). Luddin asked 10 questions about each partner's behavior (usually off-beat or bizzare, such as "makes animal sounds in their sleep"); each player held up a pair of underwear boxers for men, panties for the women to answer which one fits that particular behavior. Each match was worth cash, with seven matches earning the couple a vacation. The situation comedy element (acted out between rounds) followed Luddin's fictional off-stage life and encounters with his backstage crew.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087325</url></doc>
