<plot>Narrated by Academy Award winner F. Murray Abraham, A GANG FOR GOOD looks at the last self-governing "junior republic" in this country. The 6 to 18 year old citizens of the Boys Brotherhood Republic (BBR) elect their own mayor and city council, and administer their own police and court systems. Located on New York's Lower East Side, one of America's toughest neighborhoods, these youngsters learn self-esteem and discipline while they campaign for office and vote, legislate and enforce their own laws. Centered around a mayoral race, the film introduces these young people and their families and demonstrates the positive impact the BBR - currently facing extinction - has had on their lives. A GANG FOR GOOD is an eye-opening introduction to the potential of the junior republics to deal with the problems today's children face growing up in a violent society.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010793</url></doc>
