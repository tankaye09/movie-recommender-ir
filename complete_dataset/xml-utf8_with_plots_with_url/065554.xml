<plot>Coming from a small village from Central India, naive Bajrang finds himself exploited when he travels to Bombay. On the bright side, he meets with a beautiful woman named Bhavna Bhardwaj, and falls in love with her. But Bhavna is in love with Ravi Malhotra, who is a CBI Officer. Ravi and Bhavna get intimate, and circumstances force them to live apart. Bhavna gets pregnant and gives birth to a baby boy and names him Rohit. Since she is unable to name the father, Bajrang comes to her rescue and lets Rohit use his family name. What Bhavna does not know that Bajrang is now a gangster; and that her beloved Ravi is now married to a woman by the name of Radha; and that Ravi has been assigned to arrest Bajrang at any cost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065554</url></doc>
