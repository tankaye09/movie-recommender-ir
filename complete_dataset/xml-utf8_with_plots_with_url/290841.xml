<plot>Martin "Bird" Johnson is a 17 year old white trash kid who runs. He runs to keep from being beaten up. With his Mother in prison, his Father gone, and his Grandfather beating him, there's nothing to do but run. One day the manipulative High School Track Coach sees him outrunning his entire track team, (they want to beat him up), and figures Martin is his ticket to a college coaching job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290841</url></doc>
