<plot>Matt and Laurie are a seemingly happily married couple, but Laurie fails to return home from a girls' night out. The police find Laurie's car abandoned by the river. Matt meets Belinda, who tells him that "girls' night out" really means going to an exclusive invitation only women's spa named "Girls' Night", which caters to women's fantasies, even including anonymous sexual partners. Matt confronts the spa's owner Sahara, who is less than helpful due to the club's strict privacy policy protecting patrons, while his friend and coworker Chase tries to get close to Sahara using his charm. Will Matt, Chase or the police find Laurie? Will she be dead or alive? And who is responsible for her disappearance?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?388752</url></doc>
