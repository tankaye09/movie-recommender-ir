<plot>Set against the backdrop of New York's failing public school system, Coach is a journey through the blood, sweat and tears of a High School sporting season. Players battle for a future as coaches act as mentors and guides in their fight to teach their student lessons that will help them in their future lives. Coach Martin Jacobson was a successful college coach before becoming a heroin addict, losing all of his possessions and nearly his life through drugs. Being a High School coach for Jacobson is some sort of redemption. He works with some of New York√∑s poorest and most needy immigrant kids. Coach Larry Major has worked in Paul Robeson High School in Brooklyn for the past 10 years. After a crushing defeat in the City Championship final he passes on the school's main coaching position to an ex-student Todd Myles. Myles was en route to a lucrative NBA career when a serious back injury changed his career path last year. Myles has a lot to learn. Coach Major will have to do everything in his power to guide Myles through his first year of coaching.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109512</url></doc>
