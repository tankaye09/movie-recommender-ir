<plot>We have made a picture treating upon Prince Henry's visit to America in the following manner. A tableau is arranged showing the United States Capital at Washington in the centre and on either side, the bow and stern of Kaiser Wilhelm's yacht the Hohenzollern." On the right, there mysteriously appears the likeness of Prince Bismark and the later President McKinley. This fades away and there appears the picture of Admiral Dewey and Prince Henry of Prussia. This mysteriously fades away and then appears in their places the pictures of Kaiser Wilhelm, the Emperor of Germany, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States. An American and German sailor stand on either side during the entire tableau and they cover the faces of Kaiser Wilhelm and President Roosevelt with the German and American flags. A most beautiful and artistic film and an appropriate show closer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212949</url></doc>
