<plot>Doll is a psychological horror feeding on the fear of the unknown: the perverse mind of a serial killer. After the death of his mother, Raymond is forced to live alone. He is a child trapped in a man's body, with a stunted understanding of right from wrong. Raymond is without conscience, a sociopath devoid of empathy. His victims become a means to an end. Left to fend for himself in a world beyond his control, Raymond's growing insanity soon takes hold. Raymond constructs a grotesque hybrid female to quench his growing loneliness. Only when the real world, in the form of Anya, comes knocking is Raymond forced to confront the true horror of his crimes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154537</url></doc>
