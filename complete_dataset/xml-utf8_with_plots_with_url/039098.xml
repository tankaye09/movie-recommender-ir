<plot>Ten years after his divorce, a man is surprised by a visit from his now-teenage stepdaughter from that marriage. Although he has a new woman in his life, he lets the young girl stay with them. What he doesn't know is that his new "housemate" is a deranged, homicidal nymphomaniac, who tries to seduce both him and his girlfriend and takes her frustrations out on an unlucky Bible salesman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039098</url></doc>
