<plot>A mini-series that created portraits of fathers from very different walks of life: a teen dad struggling to break a cycle of fatherlessness; a factory worker discovering that he, too, can be involved with raising his daughters; and a CFO juggling the demands of a high powered executive wife and two small children. Hosted by former Senator Bill Bradley, the program aired nationally in 1998.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?190916</url></doc>
