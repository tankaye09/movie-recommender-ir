<plot>Janet Lee is fourteen. Her father wants her to be a doctor and wants her to be the best at everything. He hands Janet a pamphlet on Double Eyelid surgery, a cosmetic surgery to create a fold in one's eyelid to make them look more 'Western'. Her best friend, Esther, is popular and has double eyelids. As Janet realizes her insecure tendencies, she seriously contemplates the surgery to become, what she thinks is, better. Maybe by changing her looks she can change herself, maybe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?157438</url></doc>
