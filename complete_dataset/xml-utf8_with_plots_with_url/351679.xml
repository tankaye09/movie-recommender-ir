<plot>1930 - California. People flock here in the hope of seeking fame and fortune. This is the place where dreams come true. Behind the stylish art deco shutters of a Pasadena home, Magdalene struggles with her piano. The keys, which once responded so willingly to her touch, are now cold. Magdalene has trapped herself in a lifeless marriage, caged in a sumptuous world in which she is rootless. Through her own choices, she has been pushed to the side of her own life - in abandoning her music, she has lost the better part of herself. Death is her only hope. But a last breath of life knocks on her front door in the unexpected form of a door-to-door salesman. Miron is unaware that in stepping over the threshold, he is playing a part in Magdalene's greatest hour of despair. The night's tune will stir them in a way that will alter the course of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351679</url></doc>
