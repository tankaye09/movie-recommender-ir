<plot>You are a detective called to investigate the death of Taylor French. French is a young newspaper reporter whose professional curiosity has scared a few people in town. She has many powerful friends, but also has many shady enemies who want her dead. You have only 6 hours to solve this murder. With the help of your assistant Lucie Fairwell, you must carefully examine the crime scene, retrace the victim's last steps, interrogate the suspects, and analyze the results of forensic testing. Is this murder an act to forever keep her silence, or is the murder secondary to an alternate motive? Before you can present the evidence to the judge for warrant application, you must answer to the public by holding a press conference. Only with diligent detective skills can you catch the killer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655137</url></doc>
