<plot>While video games and action figures are the focus of gaming today, there are still plenty of folks who haven't lost their love for marbles. With Life is Marbleous, Beef and Pie serves up another slice of Americana. They uncovers the cheerful obsessions of a handful of marble loyalists in this short documentary. The film visits the home and marble collection of "The Marble Lady," and takes in the action at the National Marble Shooting Championship in rural Tennessee.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335570</url></doc>
