<plot>'Antidepressed,' follows a young man's attempts to find emotional security after his fiancée Gwen confesses to sleeping with someone else and breaks up with him. Immediately following an uncomfortable, yet rather calm break-up conversation, the young man leaves his now ex-fiancée's home and gets into his car. There, the reason for his stagnant, calm nature is introduced: the young man is taking prescription antidepressant medication. He then proceeds to carry out behaviors geared toward self-improvement, which are typical of those attempting to get over a broken heart. The young man begins to exercise, reads a self-help book for quitting smoking, and drastically changes his physical appearance. In a last, desperate attempt to change his situation he lashes out at the prescription medications that have robbed him of his ability to mourn the loss of his relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042488</url></doc>
