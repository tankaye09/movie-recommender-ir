<plot>This is the story of Lauren, a young woman from America who learns that her Uncle Sam has been missing at sea, and that as a result she has inherited a beach bar in the island of Ibiza, Spain. When she arrives, she meets Angelito, a handsome and young Spanish artist. They go to the bar, only to find it rundown. Depressed, Lauren returns to town where she meets Beth, another young American woman working in a bar, who offers to show her the town, Marilyn, a passionate young dancer who was fired after a altercation with a group of drunk buffoons, and Crazy Larry, a wacky British DJ who also was fired when he accidentally threw up on his boss. Together, they decide to renovate the bar and get business running again. Meanwhile, Beth's ex, Nick has come from the States to try to get back together with her. But romance on the rocks is the least of their worries, when they discover that Angelito's father is being held captive by Cortez, a local gangster. Will Beth and Nick get back together? Will our heroes and heroines save Angelito's dad? And is Uncle Sam really gone?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649987</url></doc>
