<plot>Delhi-based Kiran gets married to Vivek, and after a short period of time he leaves her to re-locate to America, never to return, leaving her to bring up her son, Raj, on her own. She eventually finds out that Vivek had never loved her but was forced to marry her due to an inheritance clause in his late father's will. She never told Raj about his dad as she wanted him to grow up without hating him. Years later Raj has grown up, attends Dominic Savio College and is on the basketball team. Kiran is very proud of her son but does not know that he has been having unprotected sex with a number of fellow-collegians, including Mallika and Pallavi, but plans to marry Tanvi Hyder Ali Khan. Amongst growing anger and violence against innocent Muslims, Kiran must now face the truth that her son may well turn out to be like his father and abandon Mallika; while Raj must come to terms that Tanvi is not in love with him but his best friend, Azad - and the fact that he is HIV positive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027189</url></doc>
