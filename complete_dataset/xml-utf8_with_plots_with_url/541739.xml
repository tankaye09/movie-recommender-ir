<plot>There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was released by Universal at this time; the title comes from the treacherously error filled pages of The Braff Silent Film Working Papers by Richard E. Braff. Even though Kerrigan and Madison worked together in other films, none of them bear this title, or anything near it. Victor Film Company's release charts show no release for Braff's chosen date of 22 March 1914, nor does this title appear anywhere else on their charts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541739</url></doc>
