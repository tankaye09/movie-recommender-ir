<plot>'Roya and Omid' is an exploration of trans-sexuality in Iran. Bardia, a young female-to-male transsexual reflects on his childhood spent in the wrong body, when he was known as Roya ('dream' in Persian), but wished to be Omid ('hope' in Persian). His narrative is crossed the insightful comments of several male-to-female transsexuals in Iran - Donya, Handry, Leila and Shirin, who have to endure the daily scorn of society in their new roles as women.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469493</url></doc>
