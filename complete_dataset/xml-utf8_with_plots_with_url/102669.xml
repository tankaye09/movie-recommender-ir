<plot>The proverbial colored "Chicken Thief" is here shown. The picture shows the farmer looking around for prowlers and after satisfying himself that all is well he returns to his home. As he disappears the "boogy" comes silently along and beckons to his partner, who is a big fat "smoke" to come on. Fatty goes into the coop and Skinny waits outside with a bag and experiences considerable trouble in getting one of the chickens in the bag. He finally accomplishes it and they would have taken many more but hearing the farmer returning they make off with their booty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102669</url></doc>
