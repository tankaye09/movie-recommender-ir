<plot>Raja lives an upper middle-classed lifestyle in Bombay along with his sister, Laaj, and runs an audio store 'Musicals'. He is a close friend of Ashok, who lives a wealthy lifestyle in Worli Seaface along with his widower dad, Shankarlal and grandfather. Both friends get together and arrange Laaj's marriage with an orphan, Ravi. Relations between the two become tense when both fall in love with Madhu Sinha, the daughter of Ishwarprasad, Shankarlal's estranged childhood friend, but are resolved after Ashok finds out that Madhu really loves Raja. Ishwarprasad arranges their marriage, but before that could take place, Ravi disappears, Laaj is devastated, and Raja takes to alcohol, refuses to marry Madhu, and hides a terrible secret that he cannot disclose to anyone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?449653</url></doc>
