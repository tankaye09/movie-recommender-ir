<plot>Since Anthony as a kid saw a Cuban refugee falling from the sky into his home's fireplace, he cant loose the feeling that there is something wrong in the world. He makes it his mission to find the daughter of the refugee. Living as a "blind" Flowerman in modern day London he's one day confronted with his childhood endeavor, which escalates into a vibrant chase to fulfill his task. This proves to become as much a quest for the love of his life as a search for his own identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558490</url></doc>
