<plot>Enna was infected with HIV through her husband. After losing her husband, she meets Pon, who lost his own wife to Aids at the same time. The two get married and begin a new life, work on farms during the busy season and sell frogs and fish in the village during the agricultural off-season, along with their son "Boy". Because he is also HIV-positive, "Boy" cannot go to school. He is studying with his mother and hoping to go back to school. The family's ordinary lives are filled with small happinesses even though all three are potentially facing death from their disease. Filmed over two years in a peaceful village in Northern Thailand and filmed by young Japanese director Naoi, "Yesterday Today Tomorrow" depicts pleasure and grief of life through the lives of this family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?665096</url></doc>
