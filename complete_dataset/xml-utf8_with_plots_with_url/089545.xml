<plot>Much like CC Raven, Seattle is draped in speed, flight, power and technology. A sexy, 60's-inspired CC remembers the Emerald City catapulting into the future; the city her parents watched transform. Long after her parents have ceased, the remnants of '62's Seattle World's Fair still exist. Yet, frozen...almost perfectly in time. CC's life-long mission, albeit unsuccessful, has been to scatter her parent's remains inside the Pacific Science Center. After a mysterious crash on her motorcycle, our heroin encounters Sputnik, an inquisitive computer programmer who quickly becomes her sidekick in this humorous, Sci-fi thriller. Together, the two navigate the Science Center and tangle with numerous on-duty security guards. After a series of near misses, CC finds her way into the elusive Monovator ride, beginning a surreal reunion with her long-lost parents somewhere within the cosmic ether.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089545</url></doc>
