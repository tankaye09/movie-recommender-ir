<plot>Penniless and without a job, Mortimer has just been evicted from his apartment. When the disorganized Matthew is late again for work, he is fired, and Mortimer gets a chance to take Matthew's place as a truck driver. The optimistic Matthew continues to flirt with his ex-boss's daughter, and he feigns an injury so that he can be near her. Little does he realize that the inexperienced Mortimer is about to affect his life again, in a most unexpected way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417835</url></doc>
