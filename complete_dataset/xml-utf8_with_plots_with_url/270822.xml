<plot>'ITCH' follows loner Nathan McCarthy through three days of his life - he wanders the streets of his depressing industrial town - he has chance meetings with strangers - he bumps into an old friend in a pub, Paul Chapple, who turns out to be a local small-time drug dealer and the catalyst in changing his life. Nathan has been suffering from years of manic depression. He has been in and out of institutions but nothing has helped him so far - he is a man on the edge and is to become totally unbalanced through a series of seemingly random events. Nathan has an itch he can't scratch. This is the story of how he comes to terms with his problems and how he deals with it all in his own special way. His therapy is about to begin.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270822</url></doc>
