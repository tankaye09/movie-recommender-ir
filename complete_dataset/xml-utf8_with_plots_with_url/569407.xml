<plot>Gloria whose engaged to marry Jason learns that he is going out with some friends to sow his oats for the last time. She considers this a little barbaric, so on the advice of some friends she goes out to sow her oats for the last time. She meets Phillip, a man whose tired of one night stands and wants a serious monogamous relationship. When they meet he is taken with her right away, but she neglects to tell him her real name. So, after spending the night together, she leaves him a video saying that she is engaged and that this was supposed to be her last fling.
