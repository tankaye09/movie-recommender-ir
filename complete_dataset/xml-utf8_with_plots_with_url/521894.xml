<plot>Allowishes spends his days alone alienated from the world around him. He lives at home with his self-centered mother who considers him an embarrassment. His awkward manner and quirky behavior make him the object of much ridicule as he spends his days wondering around town. Allowishes makes an old abandoned soap factory into his own private clubhouse with a membership of just one. He spends most of his days reading books, carving wooden figurines, and staring out the window. He frequently fantasizes about being a hero and saving someone's life. He longs to be recognized, applauded, and popular. But this day will be different for Allowishes. On this day he will meet the Sunshine Maker, an old homeless man who befriends Allowishes and helps him understand what it really means to be a hero.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521894</url></doc>
