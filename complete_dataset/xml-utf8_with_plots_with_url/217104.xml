<plot>Shannon Gallagher stops in a seaside town where 'familiar' faces and places abound. Logic is tossed to the wayside when she finds the lighthouse from her dreams and meets local contractor, Peter Sampson, whom she 'feels' connected to. Amongst the curious townspeople are local waitress Barb McCullan, who 'knows why she came', and Earl, the bitter bar owner, who 'would prefer that she leaves.' Christina Anne, a young girl with leukemia, captures Shannon 's heart and attention when she asks, "do you remember me from before ... way before?" Shannon faces horrific glimpses, all bearing the loss of a child, that span from the 1600's Salem witch-hunt to an 1800's tragedy at the lighthouse. Many locals, and lost souls, deal with their own Glimpses as they intertwine with hers. When Shannon is revealed to be an almost perfect match of Christina Anne's bone marrow, a centuries-old connection comes into focus. A bond that unites Shannon, Christina Anne, and Peter is destined to forever resonate through this small town, until Shannon can understand her 'life lesson'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217104</url></doc>
