<plot>He was the rock upon which the early church was built. In service to Christ, he abandoned his nets and boat to become a "fisher of men." St. Peter is one of the most important figures in the history of Christianity. He was a trusted friend and companion to Jesus, and he assumed the leadership of the Church after the crucifixion. He was the first to convert a Gentile to the faith, opening the door to salvation to the entire world. ST. PETER: THE ROCK goes beyond the scriptures to examine Peter's life and legacy. Scholars examine the state of the Church at his death in 64 AD and detail the events that led up to the shocking announcement in 1968 that his bones had been found in the catacombs beneath the Vatican. For the last 2000 years, Peter has been a potent symbol of the Church, a man capable of great faith but human enough to make mistakes. His example remains an inspiration to millions of the faithful worldwide.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608457</url></doc>
