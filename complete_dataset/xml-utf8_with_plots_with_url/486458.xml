<plot>The German composer Valentin Reiner receives a letter from his ex-wife Anna, who now lives in Los Angeles with their 18-year-old son Stefan. In her letter, Anna asks Valentin to come and help her with their son. Stefan is engaged to Leila, a young Muslim woman from Palestine, who is three months pregnant with his baby. They live with Anna and Judge Boccia, who hates black Muslims. Stefan and Leila hate Jews. Together with his buddy Riff Mason, Stefan terrorizes the Jewish community with home invasions, where they paint swastikas on the houses and leave fake anthrax letters. Reiner is determined to expose the fascist group and regain the trust of his son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?486458</url></doc>
