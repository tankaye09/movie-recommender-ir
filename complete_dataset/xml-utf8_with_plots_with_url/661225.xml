<plot>TORU NISHIMOTO -a young, hopeful Japanese-American- longs to be independent of his Japanese ancestry and to be embraced for the American citizen he is. That desire, however, would take a dramatic turn on February 19, 1942, when President Roosevelt authorizes Executive Order 9066; the mandatory internment of all Japanese-American citizens. Forced into an internment camp with his father, TEIJO NISHIMOTO, the clash of cultural differences becomes overwhelming for both men. When the opportunity arises, Toru enlists in the United States army to prove his honor as an American citizen, despite his father's deep opposition. Faced with the horrors of war, Toru attempts to reconcile with his father. The two men, divided in their view of America, struggle to understand one another. Based on a true story, Worlds Apart uncovers the emotions, events, and sacrifices made by the thousands of Japanese-American citizens who fought for their honor both in war...and at home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661225</url></doc>
