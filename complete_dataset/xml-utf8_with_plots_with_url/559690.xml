<plot>Homer and Phil were best friends. It seemed like nothing could come between them. Phil was the kind of guy that no one could ever think bad about. So when he was found dead hanging from a tree, everyone was stunned. Homer tried to tell people how he died but no one believed him. It was easier to believe that Homer was lying or crazy than to believe that Phil - the All American boy - would ever play The Game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559690</url></doc>
