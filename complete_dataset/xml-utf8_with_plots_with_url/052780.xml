<plot>This video presentation is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski, V.C., and the over 18,000 airmen of the RCAF who gave their lives during World War II. It highlights the Canadian built Lancasters from their construction at Victory Aircraft through to their use by the RCAF during and following World War II. Scenes include the Lancaster's development from its start as the Manchester bomber, construction in Britain and Canada, bombing missions, sinking of the German battleship TIRPITZ, and post war use in Canada by the RCAF. Included in the WWII segment is the National Film Board of Canada production "TARGET BERLIN" which was released in 1944. A special feature of the video covers the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum's nine year restoration program of the Mynarski Memorial Lancaster. Scenes in this segment feature restoration work, test flights, the dedication ceremonies, takeoffs and landings, and air to air shots. Today, the Museum's Lancaster is the only one flying in North America, and one of only two still flying in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052780</url></doc>
