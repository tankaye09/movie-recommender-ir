<plot>Rose Marie, aged five or six, sings three numbers in the Vitaphone sound stage decorated as an elegant drawing room. "Heigh Ho, Everybody, Heigh Ho," "Who Wouldn't Be Jealous of You," and "Don't Be Like That." She sings the first in a polka-dot sailor suit and the other two numbers in a frilly white dress. She's animated throughout, acting as well as singing. She scats in both "Heigh Ho" and "Don't Be Like That." At the end, she curtsies twice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054751</url></doc>
