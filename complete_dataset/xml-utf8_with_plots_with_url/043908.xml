<plot>Satyaprakash is an honest security officer who works at the docks in a small town in India, and lives with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Vishambernath; wife, Janki, a blind daughter, Munni; and an unmarried sister, Juhi. He hopes to make enough money to get Munni's vision back and ensure that Juhi gets married and the rest of the family are looked after well. Before that could happen, he is killed. When the Police come to his house looking for his killer, Janki, unknowingly shields the killer, but when she finds out the truth, she tells them about his location, but the killer flees. This death leaves the family devastated, on the verge of homelessness and ultimate destitution, however, they are saved by the timely intervention of a compassionate young man, Shiva, who assists them financially, gets medical treatment for Munni, and even agrees to find Juhi's elusive boyfriend, Chander, so that they can get married. What the Naths do not know is that Shiva is a killer, who has spent time in juvenile prison for killing his very own mom, and who has a secret and hidden agenda for coming to their aid. The Naths also do not know that Chander is being elusive for he is afraid of being identified by Janki as her husband's killer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043908</url></doc>
