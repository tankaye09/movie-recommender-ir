<plot>R.K. Raju, a private investigator is assigned the task of locating the missing daughter of a wealthy Hindu couple. His investigation take him to different locales, and he comes across Miss Mary, the girl closely resembling the one he is looking for. He asks her to accompany him, in the guise of teaching his girlfriend some music, to which she agrees. On the way there, they meet with Arun, who also agrees to accompany them as Miss Mary's husband. Once there Miss Mary is informed that she is the daughter of the Hindu couple, and she strongly denies this, stating that she is born a Christian, lived with a Christina Priest all her life, and has no knowledge of being a Hindu. Then a stolen locket of Devi Maa Laxmi is located, and the suspect, prima facie, is Mary and a gentleman, who claims to be her bethrothed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372153</url></doc>
