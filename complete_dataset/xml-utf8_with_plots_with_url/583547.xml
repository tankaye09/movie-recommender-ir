<plot>Stem cells are the foundation for every organ, tissue and cell in the human body. Through scientific advances their capability to repair or replace damaged tissue could serve as the basic building blocks for cures to such menacing diseases as cancer, Diabetes and Alzheimer's; their associated technologies could launch us to the forefront of the global economic community. They could revolutionize our world. However, harvesting embryonic stem cells is riddled with controversy and a great ideological divide. Free-market capitalists, scientists and researchers stand on one side. The Roman Catholic Church, Evangelical Christians and Pro-Life advocates are on the other. One side sees great potential - the other immorality and murder. And as the US debates the issue, governments in the UK, Sweden, Israel, China and Singapore plunge full speed ahead. Mighty Finn Productions feature documentary THE POWER OF ONE seeks out not only the facts in this complex issue, but the individuals most impacted by it. Through their voices we see how one cell, one scientific advance, one person could change the face of modern science and life as we know it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583547</url></doc>
