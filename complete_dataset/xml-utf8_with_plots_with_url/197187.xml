<plot>He who fights monsters must take lest he become a monster... Akeem is a troubled teenager grappling with the loss of his best friend Max through suicide. He spends most of his solitary existence holed up in the now defunct youth center where Max ended his life. The center is set amongst the underprivileged inhabitants of a London council estate. An unlikely assortment of bullies led by the narcissistic, abhorrent and cruel Kino rule the roost, terrorising residents. It is the disruptive Kino that Akeem blames for the death, having drawn Max into a game and subjected him to a sustained torment of beatings, humiliations and betrayal. Even after the death, Kino continues in his attempts to manipulate Akeem, trying to pin the blame on him. Haunted by Max's death and constantly reminded of his involvement in the death Akeem, the victim and willing participant in Kino's game to humiliate Max descends into madness and his grip on reality begins to slip. These circumstances conspire to lead Akeem to extreme actions. Enter into his life the enigmatic and mysterious femme fatale Abigail, beset with her own personal trials and tribulations. Taken by Abigail who responds sympathetically to his loss, Akeem sets out to expunge the memory of his friend's painful past and embarks on a crusade to bring down the gang and destroy their reign of terror by any means necessary. Now out of control vigilante-style and equipped with a mobile phone he uses for surveillance of the gang, he becomes less engaged with personal interactions and more fixated with documenting them with violent consequences. Akeem's inept revenge mission takes a dramatic turn when he is forced to face up to difficult questions he would rather not contemplate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197187</url></doc>
