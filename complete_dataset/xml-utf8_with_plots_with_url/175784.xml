<plot>In London, UK, Deli is keeping his late mother's restaurant and takeaway running, even though he is looking for a cook because he is a terrible one. His son Ashley helps with the deliveries and his regular customer, Digger, is a Yardy who means Deli doesn't have to pay anyone protection money. However Digger also puts off the customers, according to the new cook Anastasia. As Deli tries to lift his business up in the eyes of the community he misses that Ashley is heading the other way - looking up to Digger and looking to get involved in that lifestyle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175784</url></doc>
