<plot>LONELINESS IS SOUL features two young women, Meeka and Jessica who rent an Oakland apartment where an itinerate musician (John Balquist) occasionally crashes. His presence in the household acts like a truth serum, somehow suddenly prompting everyone, including a strange "gift-giver" (Alexander Marchand) and prying landlord to tell their strangest real-life stories. His own hilarious tale about taking magic mushrooms on the beach helps convince the viewer that the only really "safe" path in life is to go directly for one's dream "full out," holding nothing back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340801</url></doc>
