<plot>Here is an interesting and lively subject. Two men are seen on a raft, in mid-stream, fighting with bladders. When one gains a victory over the other they both tumble into the water and scramble about for supremacy. It is not alone interesting, but amusing and exciting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061131</url></doc>
