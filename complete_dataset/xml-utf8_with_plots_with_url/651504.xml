<plot>Mr. Younghusband is entertaining a pretty girl in his office when his wife unexpectedly arrives. His only way of concealing the girl is to place her in the safe. This he does. The wife enters and insists that Mr. Younghusband go out with her. The couple leave, and while they are gone Bill the Burglar seizes the opportunity to crack the safe. He drills a hole in the door and blows it up with dynamite. Out of the smoke and debris staggers the disheveled girl. An exceedingly funny situation, excellently worked out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651504</url></doc>
