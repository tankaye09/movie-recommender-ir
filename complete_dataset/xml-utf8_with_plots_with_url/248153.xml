<plot>"Willie paints a comic on his dad's bald head while the old gentleman is sleeping in his chair. His sister comes in and is greatly startled at the sight. Seeing Willie hiding behind the table, she starts after him. In his haste to get away, Willie upsets the old man; and his sister falls over him, making an uproarious finish to a laughable scene."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248153</url></doc>
