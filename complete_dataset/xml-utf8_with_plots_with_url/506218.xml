<plot>All Becky ever wanted was a chance to play Super Mario Bros. with her brother Adam, but he was always too busy trying to jump the flagpole at the end of the levels. However, when he finally succeeds and finds himself trapped inside the game, he needs Becky to get him out. Because she lacks the necessary skill, Becky seeks the help of the local Nintendo guru Lucas Burrows, convincing him of the fame and glory that await. Lucas agrees, but soon finds himself tempted with a chance to gain the all-time highest score. Now Becky must find a way to convince Lucas that her brother's life is more valuable than the notoriety that a high score would bring.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506218</url></doc>
