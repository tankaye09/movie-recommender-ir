<plot>In this popular spin-off game, "World Series of Blackjack," four celebrities compete to go against the dealer by coming closer to 21 points a hand, without going over. Number cards (including the 10) are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10 (meaning a jack, king or queen), and the ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (on a contestant's choice). In every round, each celebrity will be staked $100,000. For hands 1-11, the minimum wager is $1,000 and the maximum wager will be $25,000. Starting with hand 11, the minimum wager will be increased to $5,000 and no celebrity can make any maximum wagers at this point, therefore a contestant can wager everything they have on a given hand. If a celebrity accumulates 5 cards without going over 21, that celebrity is an automatic winner and instantly receives a payment of 1:1 on their bet. Also on deck, each card contains 6 jokers. When a contestant is dealt a joker card as one of the first 2 cards, they will have a decision to replace that card with any other card that's on the table once each player has received their first two cards. They can also take the dealer's up card, if they wish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097713</url></doc>
