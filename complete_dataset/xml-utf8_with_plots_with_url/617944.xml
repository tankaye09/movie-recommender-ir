<plot>An old woman feels like she's going through the daily motions as she cleans and cooks in a poor house - only seeing her husband when he comes in from the pub and falls into bed. However at night she is visited by Columbine who makes her feel alive and allows her to experience her dreams. However with all fantasy - it only feels special when it is fantasy and exists only at night away from reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617944</url></doc>
