<plot>With 22 black pearls to cover her costs, a mysterious woman abandons a baby at an exclusive school for girls. Perla grows up there, along with her best friend, Eva. One day, Tomas arrives and seduces Eva, leaving her pregnant. The two friends decide to have the baby and raise it together, never letting anyone know who is the child's real mother. But on their way to meet Eva's family, there is an accident and Eva dies. Perla survives and since she was found with Eva's purse, everyone believes that she is her. Perla decides to play along so that she could keep the baby and also make sure that he received all to which he was entitled. But arriving at Eva's family's house, she finds that no one wants her there--not her "grandmother," her "uncle," or her "cousin," Malvina. She also discovers that the slime who seduced her friend is Malvina's boyfriend! But Perla takes control of the family's cosmetics firm, determined to secure the best future for her "son," Charlie. And there she must deal with the intrigues of her family to wrest the firm from her hands, the schemes by Tomas' family, who happen to be the firm's most tenacious business rivals, and also the pressing attentions of Tomas, who cannot understand why Perla resists his charm and therefore chases her with every ounce of ardor he possesses. But Perla is not as immune as she seems and she doesn't know how close to love--and her real mother--she really is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429401</url></doc>
