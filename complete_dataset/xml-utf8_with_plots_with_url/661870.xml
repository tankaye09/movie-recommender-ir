<plot>Wunda Wunda is the name of an early children's television series that aired in Seattle, Washington on KING TV channel 5 between 1953 and 1972. It starred Ruth Prins as Wunda Wunda, who read stories and sang songs with other characters on the show. She wore a princess hat and clown-like make-up, sitting on a magical rug to do most of her show. She had a magic window she would draw on to help tell her stories. Regular guests included "Clancy the Clock" (an animated alarm clock) and a puppet drum with a face who indicated the beginning of music time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661870</url></doc>
