<plot>Four boys and one girl from the country establish an instrumental group with a lead singer - two guitars, ionic, percussion instruments and the pop-singer Vanya. The pop group is hoping to make it to one of the big seaside hotels during the holiday season. Their dream is to stay at luxurious hotels, and to become famous. It seems as if they can succeed, but they have to compromise with themselves. First, they have to change their singer with the mediocre beauty. The director of the youth club where they are rehearsing agrees to lend them the amplifiers, but only if accompanied by a mediocre singer ii whom he is clearly interested. And this is when they have to make the first compromise - they part with Vanya. Once they arrive at seaside hotel, the 'protégé' they were looking up to, turns out to be a cheat and the boys have to make do with a small beer bar at the beach. On the 'road to fame' they encounter unexpected difficulties, their new, beautiful singer causes additional trouble. In the vortex of small compromises, mild flirtations, merriment and disappointments the group is learning how to be self-reliant and independent. Their career ends soon, but they realize that their friendship is more important than the fame.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415724</url></doc>
