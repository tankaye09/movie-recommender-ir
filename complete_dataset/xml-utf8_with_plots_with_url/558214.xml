<plot>When Douglas Langley rescues a mysterious stranger named Sherman from two muggers behind his sandwich shop, he soon discovers his new friend has a special gift for fixing things. It isn't long before the townspeople learn that Douglas has a new handyman who can fix just about anything. Business picks up and Douglas couldn't be happier: he, fixing corned-beefs-on-rye; Sherman, fixing electric toothbrushes, hairdryers, and chainsaws. Word spreads, and people come from far and wide for Sherman's fix. Soon he's fixing not just things but also problems - taxes, parking tickets, even marriages. Then one night, Sherman performs a life-altering miracle that turns everyone's world upside down. The whole world descends on St. John's clamoring for miracles, but Sherman has one last fix that will surprise us all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558214</url></doc>
