<plot>Take me back is a sensual love story where nothing is what it seems, capturing two people as they struggle to find out the truth.. Myra has amnesia and arrives at a flat that is apparently hers with a boyfriend she doesn't remember and with only the most fractured memory and feelings to guide her on what to trust and how to respond to Charlie. The story follows them through their fractured and sometimes manipulated memories relived in the soundtrack of their relationship, as Charlie fights for the girl he loves and lost and Myra tries to recapture the truth on who she is and the real feelings she has for a man she doesn't know.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529195</url></doc>
