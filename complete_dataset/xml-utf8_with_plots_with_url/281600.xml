<plot>Two brothers, Ho-jin and Dae-jin, were the only family they had. The older brother Ho-jin married Eun-soo, extending their family to three, and they all lived happy, tranquil days together. But one day, in spite of Ho-jin's objection, Dae-jin takes part in a car race finals. At the exact same time and in different places, both brothers get into a tragic accident and they both lose consciousness. One year later, a miracle unfolds when Dae-jin wakes up from his coma. But when he does, he claims that he's Ho-jin. After taking care of Dae-jin at the hospital, Eun-soo and Dae-jin go home and their life together begins. But Eun-soo is utterly confused as Dae-jin's way of talking, tastes and even habits are exactly like her husband's. Eun-soo has trouble accepting the fact that her husband's spirit has taken over Dae-jin's body, while Dae-jin tries to convince her that he's really her husband, Ho-jin. At first they live distantly from each other, but as time passes, they get closer. Eun-soo keeps noticing things about her husband from Dae-jin, but she persists on keeping a fine line between them as in-laws. Then Dae-jin weeps while recalling a memory that only Eun-soo and Ho-jin would know. Finally, Eun-soo breaks down the barrier she built, and accepts Dae-jin as her real husband. Feeling that it could've been a love lost forever, they begin a more passionate love, but the people around them look distastefully at their relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281600</url></doc>
