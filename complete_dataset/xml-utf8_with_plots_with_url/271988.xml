<plot>In Manhattan, the successful executive Jack is a methodical and controlled man with simple habits that works in an advertisement agency with his coworker George. While smoking a cigarette on the roof of the building of the agency, Jack meets the aspirant actress Jill that has just arrived in New York and is seeking a job. He sympathizes with her situation and gives her name to a Klubendorf commercial in the campaign promoted by his agency. When he takes Jill home, he finds that she lives in a very low-budget hotel and out of the blue, he invites her to stay in the guest room of his fancy apartment for a while. Jill changes the behavior of Jack that becomes happier, and proposes Jack to write together a manifesto where the first rule is "be honest". However, she omits to Jack that she is sick with cystic fibrosis and she would have only a couple of years more. When Jack discovers that Jill is ill, he feels betrayed with her violation of their first rules, and they split. But Jack is changed and sooner he decides to seek out Jill.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271988</url></doc>
