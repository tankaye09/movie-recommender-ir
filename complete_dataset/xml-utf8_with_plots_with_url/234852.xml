<plot>A moving and politically sophisticated analysis of the international debt situation through the eyes of the women of Bolivia, the poorest country in Latin America. Although most directly affected by government austerity programs, peasant women are assumed not to understand the workings of international capital and foreign policy. This documentary poignantly contradicts such assumptions as teachers, textile workers and miners wives speak vividly and with great comprehension of the causes of the debt crisis and the burden they are forced to bear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?234852</url></doc>
