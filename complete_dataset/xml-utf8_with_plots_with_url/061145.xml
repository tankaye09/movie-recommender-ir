<plot>Taken at the Mid-Lent Carnival at Nice, France, 1903. A beautiful scene showing numerous carriages and floats, handsomely decorated with flowers of every description. As the carriages pass by the great crowd of spectators, the occupants are seen throwing flowers at the people. The end of this picture shows the prize winners. Very interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061145</url></doc>
