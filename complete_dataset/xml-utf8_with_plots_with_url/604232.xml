<plot>In "The Wrap-Around Story", after a man leaves his mistress in their motel room, his wife sneaks in with a gun and ties the mistress up and forces the mistress to listen to two stories and critique them. The first is "The Box," and involves three hookers arriving in a mining town to move into a theater they bought to be their whorehouse. The town's mayor is upset, as he governs all the morals in the town. He has a box with a "thing" in it that people are afraid of: bad news for the hookers. The second is "Thing in a Jar," in which a woman keeps having vivid nightmares and visions of her husband mutilating her. She has a friend who encourages her to leave her husband, but it may not be that easy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604232</url></doc>
