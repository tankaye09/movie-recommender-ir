<plot>Happy Hour tells the story of 5 young people, all working at the same club. Dennis Wilke, a young bartender who is about to die, gives us an insight of typical nightlife situations that we all may have been in ourselves. Of course, he sees things quite differently compared to the view of his boss, the waitress or the runner. Each of our protagonists has its own goals and dreams which he/she is trying to reach more or less consequently. But how honest are they all to themselves? How honest are we all when it comes to justifying our own behavior in front of ourselves? Happyhour doesn't want to judge, but provide an entertaining chance for self-reflection.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229676</url></doc>
