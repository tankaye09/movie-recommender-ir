<plot>One of the oldest yet most popular of the many old subjects is that of a Circus Street Parade. To those who have never entered a circus arena, it is doubly interesting, showing the men who tame wild beasts and also the animals as well as the funny clowns, chariots to which are harnessed twelve horses in tandem and curiosities only seen in the greatest circus aggregation in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059990</url></doc>
