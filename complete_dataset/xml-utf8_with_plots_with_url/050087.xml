<plot>"This picture is very notable from the fact that at the end of the scene, after the run-by of various engines and hose wagons, an engine was forced out of its course into the Biograph camera, smashing it to bits. The negative was saved out of the wreck and presents a remarkable photographic illusion, inasmuch as one who looks at it gets the effect at the end of the picture, of a fire engine at full tilt dashing directly toward him."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?050087</url></doc>
