<plot>Sunny is a psychopathic serial killer in the form of composer/musician whose victims are adulterous artistes. His deranged behaviour and actions are the direct result of having witnessed his father murdering his adulterous mother. Meanwhile, Sunny falls in love with Natasha, a new talent he's grooming. Although she has a good reputation, Sunny fails to convince his deranged father of this and Natasha almost becomes a victim of a different sort.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523071</url></doc>
