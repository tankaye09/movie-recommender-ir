They also find out that Ranga is having an affair with Sita (Vijayeta Pandit). But both Ranga and Sita deny this, though Chanda is unable to make up her mind as to who to believe. Then the woman who had assisted Daya Sagar's wife during her pregnancy, comes forward and tells her that she had given birth to two daughters, this throws the entire family into turmoil, as each has an agenda that they had prepared for their benefit, however, with the entry of the second daughter, who will stand to loss the most.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645662</url></doc>
