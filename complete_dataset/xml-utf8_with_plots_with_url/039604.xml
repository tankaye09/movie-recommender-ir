<plot>In this Columbia All-Star Comedy (production number 8435), Andy has enough money to buy a ticket for the championship fight, an event he has long planned to attend, but he has to use it to pay his brother-in-law's traffic fines. After getting some more money, he tells his boss he needs the afternoon off to attend his mother-in-law's funeral...hold it, we've seen this before. Ahhh, yes, with W. C. Fields in "The Man on the Flying Trapeze" written by Fields, directed by Clyde Bruckman,and now dusted off by Bruckman for an Andy Clyde short. This short, coupled with a few others, is part of the "petty larceny" that caused the multi-talented Bruckman's career to be shortened, and left him on the outside-looking-in. Columbia did a bit of larceny themselves on this one, by the use of some earlier Clyde footage with Geneva Mitchell, which is why the long-retired-from-films Geneva Mitchell appears in this 1946 entry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039604</url></doc>
