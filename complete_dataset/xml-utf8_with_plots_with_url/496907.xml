<plot>Suffering from an unbearable attack of trapped wind, Sarah seeks to alleviate herself in the quiet environs of the office bathroom. Finding solace there, she prepares to break wind to her hearts content. But just then, she is interrupted by Natalie, a work colleague, who arrives into the bathroom to freshen up. With the quietness of the bathroom, breaking wind is not an option and with the pressure building there is only one solution. Hearing the incessant beeps of Natalie's phone, it all becomes to much for Sarah. She decides on the only course of action she can think of, a deadly solution to her uncomfortable predicament.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496907</url></doc>
