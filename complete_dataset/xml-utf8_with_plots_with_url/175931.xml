<plot>Heralded as "a must see" by the Los Angeles Times, the enormity of Elton John's stage performance will be brought to television with the 36 high-definition cameras used to film the special. The special will feature Elton John's show from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, incorporating his incredible performance and best-known repertoire from his more than three decade career with spectacular videos from acclaimed director David LaChappelle including two that feature Justin Timberlake as a young Elton John during "Rocket Man" and Pamela Anderson performing a pole dance during "The Bitch is Back." Emmy Award winner Rocky Oldham (NBC's "Cher: The Farewell Tour") is executive producer and Dave Mallet is the show director.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175931</url></doc>
