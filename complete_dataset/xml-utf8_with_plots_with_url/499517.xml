<plot>Warren Criswell's darkly humorous "Six Moments" is a compilation of six animated shorts: Nocturne, Interior with Crow, Night Moves, Nude Descending a Staircase, The Crow, and The Crossing. Each was created independent of the others, but the set can also be seen as a kind of chronicle of a man's misadventures in love, life and art. From the bedroom to the road, followed relentlessly by a hungry crow, he arrives finally at a kind of roadkill epiphany, like Faust entering Heaven, as a winged hyena drags his remains off the highway.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499517</url></doc>
