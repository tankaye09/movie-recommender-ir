<plot>Here we show what is considered the most perfect likeness of the King and Queen that has been secured since the death of Queen Victoria. The King appears in full military uniform, accompanied by Queen Alexandria. They are attending a launching of a British battleship. The scene first opens by a troop of British Naval Reserves marching by and being reviewed by crowds of people. The King's carriage then drives into view and stops before the door. Queen Alexandria then appears, accompanied by Joseph Chamberlain and many other British notables. She is closely followed by King Edward, who takes his seat in the carriage opposite her. Field Marshall Lord Roberts then appears as the carriage drives away. The next scene shows the King and Queen driving homeward, accompanied by mounted soldiers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292388</url></doc>
