<plot>Ever since they were discovered in 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls have proved to be one of the most important finds ever, informing man-kind of their origins and, since they contain a 2000-year-old incarnation of the Bible, charting religious and sociological history. Learn how archaeologists found them and how the entire world reacted to their discovery, and watch a reenactment that purports to trace just how the documents ended up where they did.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?563671</url></doc>
