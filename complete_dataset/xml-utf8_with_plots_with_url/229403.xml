<plot>One fine day, Tristan Rochester meets Trisha Reynolds at a coffee shop, and the chemistry is instantaneous. Suave, charming, and all too interested in every facet of Trisha's life, Tristan is smitten to the core, and his first date with people-pleaser Trisha sees sparks fly. As their relationship slowly progresses, however, Tristan comes under fire from Matt, Trisha's jealous ex-husband and the father of Trisha's young son Landon, to whom Tristan also takes a liking. Despite the best efforts of everyone around him - from his testosterone-infused work buddy Jeff to his worried sister Maggie - Tristan remains loyal to his love, even as Trisha seemingly sways emotionally and physically towards Matt. When the time comes and Tristan makes up his mind to propose to a finally free Trisha, everything finally seems right with the world. But when Landon returns home from a visit to his dad's place, and finds Tristan alone in his house and his mother nowhere to be found, a fateful moment turns everything we knew about Tristan, Trisha, Matt, and their complex triangle upside down. As flashbacks from the minds of numerous characters fill in the gaps, we are forced to confront the twisted truth of how much Tristan and Trisha really loved each other, and how much can really be trusted of what we've seen, heard, and felt.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229403</url></doc>
