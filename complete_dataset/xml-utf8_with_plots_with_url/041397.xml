<plot>The film is based on the eponymous book by Leo Tolstoy. Anna Karenina (Drubich) is a young and beautiful wife of Mr. Karenin (Yankovsky), who is 20 years older. She meets the handsome Count Vronsky (Bezrukov), and they fall in love with each other. Anna is torn between her love to Count Vronsky, and her loveless marriage to Mr. Karenin. Her husband Karenin will not give her a divorce, because he wants to keep the mother of their child. The lovers are trying to escape from a society that does not accept their actions. Anna moves in with Vronsky, and her life becomes more complicated then ever. Vronsky comes to a point, where his personal career is compromised by his relationship with Anna. She becomes traumatized by the conflict between her new desires and her duties as a wife and a mother. Painful reality causes her a depression and suicidal thoughts. Anna loses interest in such a life and jumps under a train.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041397</url></doc>
