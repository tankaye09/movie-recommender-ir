<plot>A rectangular pink cartoon character is jealous. Jealous of all those people with a nose. He doesn't have one and everytime he put glasses on, they just roll of his face. This is a big problem, since he is short-sighted. Bumping into closed doors seems to have become a daytime job. Since our little pink friend can be quick tempered, his lovely blue pony-tailed wife is getting more concerned by the day. Especially since her husband has the habit to stay out of bed all night, trying to manufacture artificial noses which are doomed to fail. She finds a company that will solve her husband's nose problems, but might create another.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418013</url></doc>
