<plot>Thomas is tormented by bad dreams. He finds himself traveling to Macau, but why? His grasp on reality seems to be slipping. Has he been here before? Shortly after arriving he is drawn to a prostitute, who reminds him of someone. Even more strangely she claims she is his girlfriend but he has no recollection of her. After a night of drinking and harrowing nightmares, Thomas slowly remembers her name and some memories of them together in the past. Before long Thomas is lost in this all too familiar underworld. As the pieces of his memory fall into place, he finds that his past and present are intertwined and he is hurtling toward a nightmarish conclusion that has haunted him all along.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350027</url></doc>
