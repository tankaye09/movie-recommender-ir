<plot>Clarence lives a solitary existence. He has his job, his one friend, and his lifelong secret - a third eye that sees the truth. Hiding his eye from the rest of the world is not really a problem, until Eustice, his mailperson and a loner in her own right, comes along. Eustice and Clarence quickly prove to be a perfect if odd couple. But who could possibly want to be with a freak with a third eye? Does Clarence risk revealing his eye to Eustice or does he retreat to the secretive campground where he can be with others like himself? Through his struggle, this quirky, wide-eyed fantasy fable explores the heart's ability to change one's mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247936</url></doc>
