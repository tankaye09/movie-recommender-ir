<plot>Music has always been an integral part of the world. It helped usher in new seasons, it mystified sacred rites, gave courage in battle, and wooed loved ones for thousands of years. The Maltese were no different. Like the rest of humanity they have always found a desire, under the burden of struggling for food and water - to tell of their lives, their pain and their joy and to be entertained. Yet today what remains of that musical legacy is a distant faint echo. Our past was completely re-shaped by foreign rulers with the result that we inherited a present that does not fully belong to us. This film tries to rediscover our musical heritage. It is about giving dignity to our islander roots and asserting a future for our past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183084</url></doc>
