<plot>BBC producer/director 'David Thompson (I)' (qv) follows a group of admirers of the film _A Canterbury Tale (1944)_ (qv) on their annual location walk in 2005. As this was the year of the centenary of the birth of director 'Michael Powell (I)' (qv) the location walk included visits to a lot of the places around Canterbury where Powell grew up. The documentary includes interviews with walk organizers 'Paul Tritton' (qv) and 'Steve Crook (II)' (qv) as well as with various other people there. Some of the scenes from the film are re-created with people on the walk reading out the lines from scenes filmed at those locations 60+ years ago.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008130</url></doc>
