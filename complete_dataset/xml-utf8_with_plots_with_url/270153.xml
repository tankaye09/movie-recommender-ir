<plot>For more than 130 years, Coney Island has undergone a dramatic transformation that has cemented its reputation as the "Sodom by the Sea," "Nickel Empire," and "City of Fire." Amusements and attractions have been destroyed and unearthed. Business and commerce have flourished and failed. Developers have promised to restore the "old Coney" in a proposed multimillion dollar renovation. What do these changes speak for this historical, popular, and eclectic territory? What will be destroyed, and what will be preserved? Through a combination of Super 8 film, digital video, and sound collage, IT'S ALL HERE, IT'S ALL REAL, IT'S ALL ALIVE!!! reveals the ecological changes that Coney Island has endured as it faces an imminent and controversial redevelopment in the years to come.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270153</url></doc>
