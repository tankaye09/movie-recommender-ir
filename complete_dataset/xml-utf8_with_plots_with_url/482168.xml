<plot>To celebrate his 40th year in motion pictures, Screen Snapshots joins the Hollywood "Saints and Sinners Club" in honoring Adolphe Menjou. Various members said a few nice things or cracked a joke or two, or as many nice things or cracked jokes that could be crammed into about seven minutes, as Mr. Menjou spent the other three minutes delivering a speech. The attendees were a couple of names that had worked with Mr. Menjou in silent pictures, or actors currently under contract at Columbia or currently working in a Columbia film. None of the A-List members of the club were present. Those that were ranged from an-unborn-Kathy Griffin D-lister to the Chill Wills B-lister.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482168</url></doc>
