<plot>Here we present probably the most interesting and valuable picture of the McKinley funeral series. Our camera is located opposite the McKinley home on Market street, Canton, at 9 A.M. on the day of the funeral, September 19th, 1901. As the camera revolves immense crowds of people who are slowly passing the house come into view. The soldiers of the National Guard of the State of Ohio are everywhere visible. In the center of the film we present an absolutely perfect view of the McKinley home and at the front door can be seen a soldier and a sailor on guard. The camera continues revolving until the McKinley house passes out of view and the strip ends with the camera looking down Market street toward the Court House</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422065</url></doc>
