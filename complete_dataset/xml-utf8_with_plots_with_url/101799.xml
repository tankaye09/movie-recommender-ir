<plot>The story concerns two middle-aged old friends, COLE and LUD, who have been recovering from a horrible car crash caused by the alcoholism of LUD. Two years later they employ a very beautiful, though mentally challenged maid named KAREN who comes from a home for troubled young girls run by MRS. WARE, a Bible teacher. COLE develops a platonic crush on KAREN and finds her inspirational in his work as a nature photographer while LUD sexually abuses her in secret. DARLENE, COLE's ex-girl friend, who hasn't seen him since their break up just before the car crash, arrives with the purpose of reuniting with COLE and becomes a witness to the tragic events about to unfold.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101799</url></doc>
