<plot>Shankar Swami lives a wealthy lifestyle in India along with his wife, Annapurna; sons Chandru and his wife, Rajini, and daughter, Mohini; daughter, Bhagwanti and her husband, Mahesh, and an adopted son, Manikanth. He is an ardent devotee of Harihar Puthra Bhagwan Shri Ayyappa, worships Him regularly, and donates generously in His name. His life gets complicated and tense when Annapurna's brother, Laxman, moves in, starts embezzling money, then instigates Chandru to embezzle even more, invest it in a failing business run by Parvati, leading to Chandru moving out with his family. Laxman then accuses Manikanth of molesting Bhagwanti but Shankar refuses to believe his allegations. Shankar and Manikanth decide to go for a Tirathyatra, and in his absence, Laxman steals the Idol of Bhagwan Shri Ayyappa, assaults Annapurna and Bhagwanti and flees to a Tantrik to unleash more misfortune on Shankar's family. When Shankar and Manikanth return they have to face even more turmoil when Mahesh decides to steal jewelry meant for Bhagwan Ayyappa's Idol, and their trusted servant, Mukand, decides to plant a bomb in the car which has Shankar and Manikant riding as passengers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067967</url></doc>
