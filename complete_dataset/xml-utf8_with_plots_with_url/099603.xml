<plot>Change Comes Knocking is the tumultuous story of a bi-racial anti-poverty organization, called the North Carolina Fund (NCF) that boldly confronted the explosive issues of race, class and politics during the turbulent 1960s. In 1963, progressive North Carolina Democratic governor, Terry Sanford took an audacious step to attack the entrenched poverty he found throughout his state. The Fund directly empowered poor people, including African Americans, so they could themselves ruffle the feathers of the establishment, all too comfortable with the racial divisions that were the foundations of the economic status quo. Add to that a charismatic Fund employee named Howard Fuller, who spoke of Black Power and urged a more confrontational approach, and the backlash came swiftly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099603</url></doc>
