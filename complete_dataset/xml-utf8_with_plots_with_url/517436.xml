<plot>Stranger than Fiction is a 15 week series of acclaimed documentary films from around the world, some of which changed the ground rules for the documentary. Many have not been shown on television in Australia before now. They are an eclectic and eye-opening mix of programs and a wonderful late night treat for film buffs and anyone looking for something outside the standard fare. They are all multi-award winning films from outstanding filmmakers. The series is presented by Mike Rubbo - Mike was the Commissioning Editor of Documentaries at the ABC some years back. Prior to that he worked as a filmmaker at the National Film Board of Canada for many years. He has worked on, lectured about and presented films in Europe, America, Russia and Asia. He knows most of the filmmakers and takes great delight in telling the behind-the-scene stories of their films.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517436</url></doc>
