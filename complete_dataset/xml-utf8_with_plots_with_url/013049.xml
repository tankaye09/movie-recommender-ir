<plot>Paul, who thinks the only important things in a relationship are looks and image. He only likes women half his age but has discovered he's losing his hair. He's worried because he thinks he'll lose his 22 year old girlfriend Sarah. While Sarah announces that her parents are coming to meet him (an idea that is not made Paul very happy), he discovers an advert: 'The Final Solution to Baldness'. Paul, a not very intelligent man who believes everything, not hesitates to try it, thinking that it is a revolutionary idea to improve his relationship. But the idea won't work so well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013049</url></doc>
