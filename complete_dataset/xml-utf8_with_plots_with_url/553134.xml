<plot>Painter Van Dyke Tarleton is consumed by his desire to complete his masterwork, a portrait of Lucifer. But he lacks the proper model who can portray the evil soul of the devil. Sent out West with his wife Naomi for his health, Tarleton encounters outlaw Bowie Blake and sees in Blake the face he needs for his painting. Blake is not interested in modeling, but agrees after Naomi's entreaties. Blake begins to fall in love with Naomi, especially as Tarleton insults her persistently in order to obtain the proper expression on Blake's face as he paints. Blake leaves them, unable to stand the situation. But when outlaws assault Tarleton and his wife, Blake returns to resolve the conflict once and for all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553134</url></doc>
