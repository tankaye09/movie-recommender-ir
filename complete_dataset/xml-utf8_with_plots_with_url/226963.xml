<plot>Happy Together is a hugely successful melodrama that tells the heart-wrenching story of five siblings whose lives are irrevocably changed by the tragic death of their parents. Tae Poong is a professional baseball player, who just so happens to be one of the orphaned children, now all grown-up. It seems three of the children were taken away, but for some reason, Suh Tae Poong and his younger sister were left behind. Due to Tae Poong's young age, his little sister had to be given up for adoption. Ever since, the kind-hearted Tae Poong has longed to bring the family back together, searching his whole life for his brother and three sisters. However, the reunion won't be quite what he expected!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226963</url></doc>
