<plot>The story of a Bulgarian man who traveled around the world and who, for eighty two years, has done everything his way, as Frank Sinatra sings in his song. Luka Dokov: born in 1925 in the Bulgarian town of Pirdop, studied in the American College in Sofia, and spent the next 60 years journeying more than 120 countries, immersing himself in various cultures, and working for the establishment of national economies, always holding proudly his Bulgarian passport. His name is well known in the Arab world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?347059</url></doc>
