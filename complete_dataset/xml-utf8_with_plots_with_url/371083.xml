<plot>He may be in his mid-twenties, but Jackie far from growing up. College? No, that's for derelicts. A job, any job? Not a chance. Free-loading off his rich uncle, Jackie spends his time hanging out with his uncle's landscapers and the neighborhood mailman. Jackie's dreams of success materialize when he comes up with the ultimate scheme: partnering with children to steal their fathers' vintage baseball cards. Jackie organizes his crew and the money starts rolling in, but he wants to take his scheme further--to the Internet. The only problem is, neither Jackie nor any of his half-witted crew members know anything about the web, forcing Jacking to scramble to survive in the seedy underworld of black-market baseball card deals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?371083</url></doc>
