<plot>Have you ever said these words to someone -- "If we're both still single in a few years......let's get married." Well, some things have a way of coming back to haunt you. Brandon and Katie were friends in college who agreed to this pact. Years later, he's about to find out how serious she REALLY was about their little deal. So, be careful what you agree to because it might come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372325</url></doc>
