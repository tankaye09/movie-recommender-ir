<plot>A farmer takes a prize goose to the photographer, and while the artist shows the hayseed what his goose looks like through the camera a tramp enters, hangs his cap on the lens and runs off with the goose. When the "Rube" finds his bird gone he accuses the photographer and they engage in a fight. The wind-up shows the farmer jamming the camera down over the head of the photographer, with his head protruding. This is a funny subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431480</url></doc>
