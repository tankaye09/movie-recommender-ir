<plot>"Downhill Speed" reveals three professional downhill mountain bike racers at home, training and at play, while shadowing them through the ups and downs of a race season. The action begins with the Sea Otter Classic in Monterey, California, followed by the Southern California NORBA National at Snow Summit, and finally the Grouse Mountain World Cup in Vancouver, British Columbia. "DHS" gets under the helmets and goes deep into what drives these racers, each coming from different walks of life, but with one underlying passion-racing mountain bikes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158232</url></doc>
