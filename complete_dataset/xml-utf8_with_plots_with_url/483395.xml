<plot>Florence Wendell decides to marry Walter Fairchild despite warnings from her friend, Gilbert Gaylord, that the spectre of his dead first wife will constantly interfere with their married life. Florence loves Walter, but insists upon moving to a new apartment and refurnishing it to minimize that interference. They marry and live happily, especially when Walter sends his 7-year-old son, Junior, to a school in Switzerland so they can start their marriage by being alone. But some time later Walter gets a cablegram telling him that Junior is deathly ill from typhoid fever, and asking him to come quickly. He decides to do so without consulting Florence, who is now pregnant and expecting her baby any moment. She tells him she won't have him when he comes back, because he did not consider her feelings. The boy survives, and he and Walter return, but Florence considers her marriage over and decides to leave with Gilbert even though she doesn't love him. Gilbert, however, doesn't want her new baby to come with them, putting her in a quandry as to what to do.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483395</url></doc>
