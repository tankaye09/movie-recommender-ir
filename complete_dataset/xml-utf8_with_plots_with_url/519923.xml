<plot>Tom Green brings his unique style of purile behaviour to the serious people of Japan. He mocks their society, tradition, lifestyle, authorities and wildlife. Nothing is sacred. Tom laughs at a man and yells "bum bum" in one of Japans oldest and most sacred temples. Tom pretends to orally pleasure a robotic Santa Claus which sings "The yellow rose of texas" in the middle of a crowded shopping centre. Tom throws up due to a fork costume he was wearing restricting his airways. Tom buys a pair of panties with a picture of their former owner from a "Panty dealer". He claims they will make a good gift for his Mom. Tom lay down on the stairs of the busiest subway station in the world until escorted away. Tom compares Monkey and Chicken faeces. Tom locks a Japanese snow monkey in his van and then proceeds to dress as a fishman and climb in with it. Tom disgruntles a sushi chef by placing a dildo on a food selection conveyor belt. Absolutely nothing is sacred.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?519923</url></doc>
