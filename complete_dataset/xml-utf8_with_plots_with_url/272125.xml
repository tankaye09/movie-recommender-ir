<plot>Jack is a young single doctor, the kind of catch most women would love to make. But the ones that do change their minds the minute he wraps his hands around their neck. Something about the heat of a passionate moment always drives Jack over the edge. One day when a beautiful young woman (Holly) happens into Jack's office after being beaten by her husband, sparks fly between her and the Young doctor. Will Jack take Holly away from her abusive husband or will she become another victim? Will the detective, who is hot on Jack's trail catch up to him in the end? All of these questions will be answered, but in a way you'll never see coming.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272125</url></doc>
