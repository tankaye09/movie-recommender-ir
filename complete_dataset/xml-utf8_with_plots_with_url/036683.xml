<plot>The scene takes place in a fashionable cafe. A well dressed couple enter, and after a careful perusal of the menu, conclude on an order of boiled eggs and Welsh rarebit. The obliging waiter delivers the order. The guests break open the eggs, and two beautiful white chickens fly across the room. The diners then perform a similar trick with the Welsh rarebit just served, and two beautiful snow white rabbits hop from the dish and are seen kicking and squirming as they are lifted to the floor. It was all a joke, but the waiter is not on. Your audience will catch on, for it is a good, lively subject, full of action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036683</url></doc>
