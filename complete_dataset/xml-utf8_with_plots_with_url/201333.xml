<plot>Some hundred peasants - Bulgarians, Gypsies, Turk and a Professor live and have fun in a godforsaken mountain village. Rumen Georgiev is the first professor in photography at National Academy of Film and Theater Art in Sofia, Bulgaria. He looks like the local residents of a village. 'The Professor' neither sows, nor gathers crops, but is only taking pictures of his fellow villagers and hands in the unexpectedly made shots. 'The ordinary men' is the topic both of his personal creative works and of this documentary film, viewed trough his "photo world annals".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201333</url></doc>
