<plot>Judgment Day entails the lives of four friends David, Sean, Monique and Star; and how they are in their last year of high school talking about what they are going to do with the rest of their lives. They are approached by a couple of Monique's friends who try to tell them about a youth conference that they should attend but they all make excuses and fun of the fact they believe in Jesus. Seven years later we take a look in to their lives and see how they are doing. Sean becomes a successful hip hop artist, Monique becomes a crack junkie, Star becomes a drug dealer, and David becomes a leader of a gang, Once again through some of there own friends they are presented with an opportunity to come to Christ, yet they still mock and poke fun of the idea of Christ. Two months later they are given a final opportunity to come to Christ, once again they deny Him, and meet there lives with death. After death, they meet the final scene of there spiritual existence and sit before the Judgment seat of Christ and receive their final judgment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280543</url></doc>
