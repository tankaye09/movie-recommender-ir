<plot>Here we present a comic and up-to-date subject. Two hodcarriers are seated upon a large lime barrel eating their lunch. Having finished their lunches and lighted their pipes, they propose a game of ping pong. An old door is laid across the barrel, and a piece of joist laid crosswise on the door to take the place of a net. A rubber ball is produced and the sons of Erin each produce a trowel, and the game begins. As is almost always the case when Paddy and Mike engage in sport, a dispute ensues. Mike endeavors to explain the rules of the game to Paddy, but Paddy won't have it, and biff; the fight begins. Paddy and Mike fall into the mortar, and when the fight is stopped by the arrival of the boss, they are simply "sights."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433212</url></doc>
