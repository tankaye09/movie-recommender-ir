<plot>Sir John Mills made his BBC Television drama debut in this moving story which was broadcast on BBC 2 on Christmas Day 1985. He stars as a wheelchair bound Major General called Blair alongside Omar Sharif as his sardonic but faithful manservant McCorquodale. McCorquodale grew up to become Blair's manservant after Blair rescued the young child from certain death during a riot when Blair was stationed, as a young soldier, in India. Over the years the two men have built up a dependence on each other based on a mix of great affection and utter disrespect. Having finally retired from the Army to the Welsh countryside, Blair suddenly finds he can no longer afford the upkeep of his home. Persuaded by an insurance company to sell up and go into sheltered accommodation, a move that is overseen by a beautiful solicitor (played by Lucy Gutteridge), where does this leave McCorquodale.......?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165579</url></doc>
