<plot>The Last Editor chronicles the life and career of Jim Bellows, a man who made his name, as well as the names of some of the best known writers in the country, challenging the status quo and championing the underdog, the start-up and the upstart from newspapers to television to the Internet. Jim was near the top or at the helm of major metropolitan dailies when newspapers were the dominant media through the turbulence of the Civil Rights Movement, the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and the domestic turmoil of Vietnam. He was also a news producer and editor at ABC-TV, and one of the first prominent journalists to work in computer-based news and information as the editor of Prodigy, and later Excite.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569374</url></doc>
