<plot>A Cappella is a word not often associated with rock. Here, that standard is broken. Here collegiate A Cappella is shown in its true light - as a powerful, edgy genre that is sweeping college campuses and sucking in some of the coolest, hottest and most talented singers around. Follow seventeen of these people as they prepare for the most prestigious competition in the A Cappella world. Watch as the seventeen members of Reverse Osmosis (aka: R.O.) put everything on the line for their last shot at victory. Through tough, doubt-ridden choreography sessions, to emotional reunions to concerts and parties, you'll join R.O. in their battle. You'll get an insider's look at the music, friendships, talent, drama and love that defines Reverse Osmosis. And you'll believe it when one member says, "We're together because we have a love of music, but in the end - it's really the love of life and experiencing things together that keeps us going." Following suit, Rock and R.O. focuses on both the music and the friendships created within Reverse Osmosis. It is R.O's dedication to and love of music that is the film's backbone, but it is their dedication to and love of each other that truly becomes the film's heart. So, prepare to tap your feet, dance in your seat and fall in love with seventeen of the most charming, most talented people you'll ever have the good-fortune of encountering. Prepare to root for their victory. Prepare to become a gROupie. And prepare to understand why they claim that, "You can't spell ROCK without R.O."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?466157</url></doc>
