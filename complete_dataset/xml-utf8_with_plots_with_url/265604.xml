<plot>This picture shows an artist at work in his studio. Three beautiful models are posing on a platform appropriately draped. The artist's valet announces a visitor, and he places a screen around his models, meanwhile causing his patron to be ushered in. The models become inquisitive, and leaning too hard on the screen, they are precipitated to the floor with the pompous visitor underneath. Excruciatingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265604</url></doc>
