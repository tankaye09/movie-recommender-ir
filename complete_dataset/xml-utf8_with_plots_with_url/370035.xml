<plot>Milk and Fashion centers on a young foreigner, Tyler Ralstin, as he travels from rural Yunnan to Shanghai to live with his uncle Jack. As caretaker for Tyler, Jack must balance his life between the high demand of his profession and the role of a mentor as he guides his nephew through the tough life-decisions that come with growing up. Jack is the president of a cultural investment company that is sponsoring an international fashion contest, and one of the competing designers is Yao Yao, a former ballerina who has decided to pursue her dream of becoming a professional designer. The stories of Tyler and Yao Yao intertwine in Tyler's coming-of-age tale and Yao Yao's journey as she strives to accomplish her dreams. Though her journey at times seems complicated and even hopeless, Yao Yao finds a friend and mentor in Anna, an international fashion magazine editor who helps Yao Yao stay true to her goals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370035</url></doc>
