<plot>In the world of Mumkin anything is possible. This is the story of hidden identities, double lives led by one's next door neighbours, lives that even the most intimate of friends are not aware of. And naturally, when revelations happen, explosions follow. Huge fireworks are triggered off in Mumkin on a rainy night with the sudden, mysterious death of Rajeev Sinha at the businessman Mukesh Agarwal's party. A young, fun-loving, extroverted, small-time businessman himself, who handles mostly foreign collaborations with Indian firms, Rajeev Sinha seems to have no enemies. So when he barges into Police Inspector Vijay Pandey's station and falls down dead on his desk, the surprised cop can do nothing but seal the party because everyone present is a potential suspect. The list of suspects reads like a who's who of high society.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381385</url></doc>
