<plot>Winter, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. It's gray. Felix, a high school student, lives with his inattentive mother. The cupboards are bare, she watches TV constantly, he's on his own. The owner of a convenience store in the neighborhood asks Felix if he'll feed the dog at the store for a few days while he's on vacation; he gives Felix a key to the store. Felix invites a couple of his friends to celebrate their access: TV dinners and bottles of malt liquor beckon. Meanwhile, a drama plays out in the flat above Felix's. How will Felix handle his own coming of age?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602429</url></doc>
