<plot>From the ethersphere has been extracted the last remaining cine-mage from the 20th century. It has been carefully pieced together into one electro-stream. Joe likes to swim. Joe likes to make music. The imagery was culled from over twenty old, mostly educational, discarded films. The music was largely produced by manipulating sound clips from the original image sources.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278088</url></doc>
