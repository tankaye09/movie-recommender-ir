<plot>The Glenn Miller Band Reunion features original members of Miller's bands, the famed civilian one based in New York City and the specialty group he put together briefly for the Army Air Corps. The trombonist/band-leader was killed during World War II when his plane mysteriously disappeared crossing the English Channel. Jack Jones is the host, singing solo and with the other guests, 1950's recording artist Kay Starr and Los Angeles based jazz vocal group String of Pearls. Choreographer Lester Wilson created energetic nouveau jitterbugs to accompany and enhance the featured instrumentals. The music performed includes just about every Miller hit, from ''Moonlight Serenade,'' ''In the Mood,'' ''Chattanooga Choo Choo'' and ''Pennsylvania 6-5000'' to more obscure pieces like ''Love With a Capital U''. In between the live recorded musical numbers, there are biographical documentary segments, presented in the format of personal anecdotes from the original musicians themselves. Recalled are the 15-minute radio programs the band performed three times a week for Chesterfield cigarettes. There are clips from home movies made during the production of the film ''Sun Valley Serenade.'' There are several rare appearances from the unsung heroes of the golden age of the Big Band era, not only performing in the live recorded orchestra but in several of the documentary styled clips. Notably musicologist Paul Tanner and Conductor/Arranger of Sinatra fame Billy May, trombonist Zeke Zarchy, saxophonist Willie Schwartz and Air Force Band drummer Ray McKinley who also performs lead vocals in lieu of Tex Beneke.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?561028</url></doc>
