<plot>Matt is working in rural Mexico, trying to escape his conventional New York family. Just when he thinks he's achieved his goal, he receives a computer disk from his deceased grandfather labeled "it took me eighty years to learn the meaning of life." Intrigued, Matt and his new co-worker, the spontaneous and carefree Sally, journey to the nearest town with a computer to find out what's on the disk, and on each other's minds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584437</url></doc>
