<plot>Neto (Alonso Echanove) a widowed horse and carriage driver in Central Mexico, has recently lost his only son. During the day he tries to share his grief with various passengers but nobody is interested in listening to him - partly due to his obvious speech impediment. Based on the story "Heartache" by Anton Chekhov, "El Cochero" is a touching tale about loss and isolation but also about ultimately finding the strength to carry on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?169911</url></doc>
