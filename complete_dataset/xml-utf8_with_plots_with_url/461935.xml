<plot>Jessica Rattigan, wife of a bishop, will stop at nothing to preserve the family name, and over two series of "Revelations" she conceals her husband's involvement in the death of his secretary, murders her daughter-in-law Rachel and buries her in the garden, has an affair with Rachel's brother Steve, then abandons him to be blown up in a petrol explosion when he discovers that she murdered his sister. Other characters include creepy housekeeper Mary, Jessica's cousin; Gabriel, Jessica's gay son; Mark, her randy son-in-law; and Charlotte, her promiscuous daughter. The second series is by far the best, every episode well-paced and tense. "Revelations" deserved a wider audience, was compulsive viewing, and bettered many a soap shown at peak viewing time. Unfortunately, it was usually shown at times revolving around midnight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461935</url></doc>
