<plot>The story of the legendary "Mazowsze Weekly" in the reports of its founders and collaborators illustrated with archive materials from the times of Martial Law. It shows incredible courage of thousands of people fighting underground for freedom of expression in communist Poland in the '80s. The politicians of the first independent government after 1989 and the founders of the biggest daily magazine - Gazeta Wyborcza - originated from this social movement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436874</url></doc>
