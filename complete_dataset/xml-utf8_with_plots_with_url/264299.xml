<plot>Large body of Indians dressed in most hideous costumes imaginable hold dance in middle of Main Street in Sheridan. Government officials prohibited this dance on prairie and insisted that it be held where enough people would be on hand to quell any disturbance. An amusing feature is the fact that the usual crop of Indian dogs is present and some of the canines -- half coyote -- get very prominently into the picture. One of the most strange and weird Indian religious rites ever seen and its full significance is plainly shown in the picture. The Indians say this dance is their idea of the kind of fun the Great Spirit enjoys and they imagine he is sitting on his throne of gold laughing very heartily at the antics of the red children down below.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264299</url></doc>
