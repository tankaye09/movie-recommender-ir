<plot>Carmen is a spoiled rich girl and a fashion lover. She doesn't get well with her driver, Julio, a very distracted man. The father, an opera singer in his way of setting up his own play, is very unsatisfied with the driver services. Even the tutor of Carmen and Desdemona, her sister, doesn't like too much him. We're guided during the film by a kind of strange Cupid spirit, appearing in many parts of the film, and he'll be the responsible that Carmen and Julio fall in love. They get married and Carmen's new life will be very different, now with out luxuries and full of obligations with her husband, like cooking. But Carmen doesn't know anything about buying groceries and cooking, so she'll have to buy prepared food in the restaurant. However, for Camen and Julio financially things aren't going well. He wants to start a taxi business, and Carmen's expecting a baby. The problems arrive when Carmen asks for money to her father, and Julio discovers that maybe a poor life isn't for his refined wife.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168996</url></doc>
