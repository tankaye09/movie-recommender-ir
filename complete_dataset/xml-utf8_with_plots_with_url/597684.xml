<plot>Two characters, an actor and a video artist are chatting in a film set during a break. They are having a beer in the middle of props and cables. The conversation is about film sets in film and in video art projects, they are pointing out the differences of both ways of filming. They talk about budget, emotions and about the different relations that cinema and video-art have with fiction and reality. The camera has been getting closer and the quality of the image has changed to become more cinematographic. We no longer see the film set environment but just a frame with two characters. What at the beginning was a casual video in a break of a shooting is now a proper film of two characters talking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597684</url></doc>
