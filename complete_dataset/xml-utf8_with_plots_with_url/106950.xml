<plot>This most interesting subject was taken from Goat Island and shows the Horseshoe Falls and surrounding shores covered with ice and snow. One of the features of this picture is the dazzling effect of the sun on the ice-coated trees, which makes a magnificent spectacle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106950</url></doc>
