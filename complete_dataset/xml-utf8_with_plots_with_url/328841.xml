<plot>Taken on the Lehigh Valley R. R., near Towanda, Pa., in a beautiful valley along the Susquehanna River. The train is seen approaching at a speed of seventy miles an hour. As it draws near, the engine whistle warns some section hands who are working in the foreground. Just as she passes another train dashes by in the opposite direction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328841</url></doc>
