<plot>Here is shown one of the largest fires London has ever had. It was in a very thickly settled section of the city and the damage done was enormous. Various views are shown in which the firemen are seen playing the hose on the burning buildings and ruins. In the last section of this film the entire wall of one building is seen to fall, and as it strikes the ground great clouds of smoke and dust rise in the air. A very exciting fire scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340677</url></doc>
