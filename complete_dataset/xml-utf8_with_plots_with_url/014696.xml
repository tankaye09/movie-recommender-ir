<plot>A comedy scene of unusual excellence, clear and sharp photographically, and well worked out. A poet presents a spring effusion to the editor in his sanctum. It is scorned. The poet hurls a stick of dynamite into the stove, which at once explodes, wrecking the office and the editor as well. The poet returns to the scene when the smoke clears away, and triumphs over the battered editor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014696</url></doc>
