<plot>Patient 27 is a dark, edgy drama that looks inside the life of Bryan Rollins from youth to manhood. Bryan is a young, innocent child enduring hardships at home. He comes from a family history of sexual, physical, and verbal abuse. This abuse leads him to be sent to a juvenile correctional facility. Events that happen while at the facility force Bryan to be sent in for mental evaluation. During his evaluation, Bryan observes an unnatural relationship between the staff at the hospital and their patients. The director of the hospital, David Morgan, is an evil dictator that runs his hospital with all disregard to race, gender, and medical views of the 21st Century. After all the abuse Bryan endures and after witnessing patients being sexually and physically abused he eventually develops a psychotic illness. This illness pushes him over the edge. Patient 27 dives into truth and passion, while asking the question, how hard can you be pushed before you fall?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425992</url></doc>
