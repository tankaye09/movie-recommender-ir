<plot>Huub van der Lubbe, Bart de Ruiter and Jan Robijns travelled by train to Enschede in the year of 1999. For the first time they would perform together in the Concordia theatre. Five years and many shows later, the men make that same journey by train again. In front of the camera they memorize, talk about the fun of poetry, their friendship and music. These stories are richly illustrated by songs, recorded live during several performances. We also see the men working at one of their famous poet's nights at the cafe. This is a vivid, lyrical musical documentary about three boys' dreams come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645563</url></doc>
