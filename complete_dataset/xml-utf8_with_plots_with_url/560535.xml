<plot>Blake, a quarrelsome lineman, and a widower with two daughters, is in love with Helen, but she rejects his advances. Helen spies Myra, Blake's three year old daughter, who has ventured onto the tracks of the oncoming Elwood Express, and just in the nick of time, grasps the girl off the tracks, but in so doing, must leap off a trestle into a river thirty feet below; unable to swim, the two of them are rescued by the grateful and still hopeful Blake, but Helen prefers to face next week's hazards single-handed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?560535</url></doc>
