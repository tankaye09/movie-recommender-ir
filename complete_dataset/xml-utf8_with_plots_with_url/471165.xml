<plot>This BBC documentary series examines the relationship between Russia's richest men ("the oligarchs") and Putin's administration in the Kremlin. The series follows each one in turn to find out what they were up to in the years leading up to 2005, and the crew is granted intimate access. Two of the five are now in exile, wanted on criminal charges, and planning their own anti-Putin campaigns with their wealth and influence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471165</url></doc>
