<plot>The isolation room, where he stays for radioactive-iodine treatment, becomes an inspiring cinematic location for the director who is a cancer patient. Moving constantly in-front and behind the camera, he is convinced of the power of art to control and bring a happy end to his story. Hope is shuttered with the discovery of new aggressive tumors in his spine. While waiting for a series of operation in New York City, the director receives large doses of cortisone. His stream of thoughts turn into hyper-conscious flood, and the camera becomes his close and intimate companion. Shlomi Shir realizes he is being sentenced to die on the operating table. He decides to leave the hospital, overdosed with cortisone and tranquilizers and lets his soul free.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663813</url></doc>
