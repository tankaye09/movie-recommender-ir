<plot>51-year-old Christer has a plastic bag hidden in the closet. Each day when his wife and daughter leave for work and school, he sets off on his bike. Sometimes he rides far, but he is always back by 4PM. He has been doing this ever since he lost his job at Balco Montering AB along with 155 other employees. At the start of his unemployment Christer rode past his old workplace every day, week after week. It had become routine after 30 years, just like everything else in his life. Things might have went on like this forever but through a mail order firm in Germany an idea has been born in Christer's head that might break the routine. That idea is hidden away in the plastic bag in his closet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?636885</url></doc>
