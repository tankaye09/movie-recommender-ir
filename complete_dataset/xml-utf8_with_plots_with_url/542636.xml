<plot>A supernatural thriller where a haunted bed, jazz, sex, death and vengeance all collide as a mind blowing puzzle. Joy is a nurse who has been assigned to provide home care for Curtis, a patient who is in a deep coma. From the first night, things don't seem right. Joy experiences strange sounds and begins to see a menacing female figure. The following day, she is questioned by the police, who think that Curtis killed his wife, Eve. Joy becomes part shaman and part detective as she tries to peel back the layers of what happened between Curtis and Eve. But as she gets closer to the truth, there is a greater and darker secret awaiting. THE BED is a metaphor for life, love, death, and vengeance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542636</url></doc>
