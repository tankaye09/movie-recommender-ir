<plot>A Diamond in the Sky is a tale about four best friends making their transition from adolescences to adulthood. The story opens with the friends contemplating their senior year as they realize the decisions made today will dictate the life they lead. Throughout the course of the year, they fight, fall in love, and deal with moral issues that plague the lives of our youth today: peer pressure, parental pressure, teenage pregnancy, STDs, and HIV and Aids. Monique, Tyrone, Jovan, and Tyanna are four have been friends since elementary school. Tyrone is a world-class athlete who is one of the top running back prospects in the nation, yet due to his fame and popularity he questions whether people are genuine with him. Jovan is a very accomplished basketball player, but chooses not to play for personal reasons that he keeps bottled up inside. Tyanna is an extremely talented writer who is haunted by her past. Monique is a very beautiful and spoiled young woman who expects the world to fall at her feet. A Diamond in the Sky is a film that illustrates the depth of friendship...and its unconditional love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009642</url></doc>
