<plot>In 1971 50,000 people mourned in the streets of Fribourg, Switzerland: Jo "Seppi" Siffert had died in a crash at Brands Hatch (GB). Until today, Jo Siffert is considered to be one of the ten best racing drivers ever. Siffert was a popular as well as glamorous star who, shortly after his death, became a legend. The film follows the different stages in Jo Sifferts career and accompanies him from his humble beginnings to his great successes on the international racing circuits - literally, from rags to riches. Using and reviving the style of the 70s, the film interweaves authentic material with the memories of the protagonists, and creates a gripping image of those days..</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277696</url></doc>
