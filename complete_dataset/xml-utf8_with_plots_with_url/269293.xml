<plot>Smith Island in the Chesapeake Bay is home to just over 400 people who have made their living from the water for more than a century. But now the island and its culture are under assault by sea-level rise and erosion, population loss, and a decline in the oysters and crabs its people depend on. The film shows how islanders are fighting to survive and struggling with change and loss. It is a story told by a quirky cast of islanders: watermen, preachers, crab-pickers, lawmen and environmentalists. "We're so stubborn," says one waterman, "they're going to have to drag us off of here kicking and screaming."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269293</url></doc>
