<plot>Orange People tells the story of 26 year old Mandy Clark who is Orange from head to toe. Whether she is sitting out in the sun, under UV lights in salons or applying milks, lotions and sprays at home, Mandy has to have her daily dose to get through the day. Her Mother Belinda feels guilty for introducing her daughter to tanning and now thinks this is getting out of hand. Mandy's boyfriend Scott is cool about her tanning habit as long as it doesn't include him. Mandy spends most of her time at the salon with her dippy mates Luke and Amber who work there. A familiar face from the past rears its ugly head and tension builds as Belinda flushes Mandy's tanning products down the toilet. Mandy falls into depression and a professor of Dermatology warns Mandy to regulate her habit before it's too late.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415151</url></doc>
