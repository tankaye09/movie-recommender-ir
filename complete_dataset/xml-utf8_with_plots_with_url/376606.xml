<plot>'Moon in Taurus' is the story of a Swiss film-maker who, after an absence of five years returns to a small town in America where a love affair had come to an abrupt and, for him, unhappy end. Together with his film team, he tries to discover the reasons for the break-up of his relationship. His ex-girlfriend has since married and is in the throes of divorce. Parallel to this, he re-lives his own love relationship to this woman. Following a period of analytical observation, he becomes more and more involved with his own problems. 'Moon in Taurus' is a film without actors, for all the participants act themselves. This method aims at an exceptional authenticity which makes it possible for the viewer to compare the relationship conflicts with his own, and to experience the cultural differences between the continents of Europe and America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376606</url></doc>
