<plot>A mother puts her baby boy in an outdoor playpen, but he's more mature than she realizes, and quickly breaks out, and with the help of a raccoon and a squirrel, they are soon raiding the watermelon patch. Mother returns: turns out it's moving day, and the family is moving to the city. Little lambkin is not at all happy about leaving his animal friends; when they get to the new house, he sets about sabotaging the kitchen, turning the icebox into an oven, the hot water tap into an ice dispenser, and the stove and phone into water spouts. The adults flee, back to the country house, and lambkin is reunited with his friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338185</url></doc>
