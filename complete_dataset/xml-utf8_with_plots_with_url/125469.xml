<plot>The director, who admired Che Guevara, was preparing for a melodrama based in Cuba when he came across a story about the Chosun people who were sent to Cuba and forced to live there 100 years ago. He follows the lives of the descendants of people who had no choice but to accept Cuba as their country. During this journey, the director finds one thread of hope among the love, anxiety, and longing of a thousand people. This is a picture of us living in a different way in another place. Their actions set against beautiful music and magnificent landscapes evoke feelings or remorse and happiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125469</url></doc>
