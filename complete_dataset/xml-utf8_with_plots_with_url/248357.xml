<plot>This is a picture of one of the numerous stories you have read about. A man comes home from the club in a state of beastly intoxication and proceeds to undress himself meanwhile flinging his wearing apparel in all directions. He finally tumbles into bed and his wife, who has been watching him, steals in on tip-toe and turns his pockets inside out. She evidently finds what she is looking for, judging from the pleasant smile on her face, but not content with taking the contents of his trousers, she takes them also, presumably so that her husband cannot go out again. The picture is funny, amusing and lifelike, but is not objectionable in the least, and can be shown before the most particular and refined audiences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248357</url></doc>
