<plot>The desk sergeant, in dress uniform, takes a call from the chief. Three colleagues enter and he tells them that the chief wants them over at the orphanage to perform. They practice four numbers in barbershop quartet harmony: "Skinna-Ma Rink-A-Dink" is followed by something the kids will enjoy - a Mother Goose medley of four nursery rimes sung simultaneously - "Little Jack Horner" (alto), "Sing a Song of Sixpence" (tenor), "Little Bo Peep" (baritone), and "Pease Porridge" (bass). Next is a medley of "Cluckin'" and "You Tell Me Your Dream." They conclude with the ragtime "Waddle" and a bow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583225</url></doc>
