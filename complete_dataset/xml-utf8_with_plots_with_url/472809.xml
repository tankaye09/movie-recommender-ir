<plot>Indian-born beauty Sunita is crowned Miss Cosmos in the United States and is asked to be chief guest at the car racetrack. Once there she is thrilled to learn that one of the competitors is Indian-born Jaideep, and even more thrilled when Jaideep wins albeit ending up in an accident and getting hospitalized. She visits him there but is told that he is already discharged. She locates him, and both fall in love with each other. She convinces him to quit his motor mechanic job and accompany her on a world tour. He does accompany her but after obtaining permission from his employer. Both board a luxury yacht and are well on their way to more romance and adventure - little knowing that both will soon be involved in a conspiracy that will shake their faith in each other as well as land them as well as the entire crew and passengers of the cruise-line in deadly peril.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472809</url></doc>
