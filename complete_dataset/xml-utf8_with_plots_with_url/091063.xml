<plot>Call Me Average documents the legacy of Joe Average - his life, his art, his attitudes and his activism. It provides a rare glimpse into a singular imagination. Joe's story is marked by childhood traumas and adult demons; driven by an indomitable will to create. This is a film that celebrates a life of art as much as the art of living.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091063</url></doc>
