<plot>This is the story of Christine Skarbek (A.K.A. Christine Granville) who was hailed by Churchill as the most remarkable and valuable British female agent of World War II. Her larger than life personality and charisma ensured her spectacular success on wartime missions and won her many male admirers. The screenplay is built around events on the last night of Christine's life in 1952 as she gives an account of her adventures in dramatic flashback sequences. Unable to find her place in society after her wartime exploits, Christine had been ill and steadily drinking her way into oblivion, living in the shadows of her past. Gordon, a 50 year-old receptionist in the seedy hotel in which she is living inadvertently becomes her confessor. From her native Poland she conducted daring escape and rescue operations into Hungary via Slovakia as well as Turkey and North Africa and hazardous parachute drops into occupied France. Christine risked everything to complete her missions. For her and the people she loved and with whom she had found comradeship, theirs was a world with its own personal code of honor and duty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104869</url></doc>
