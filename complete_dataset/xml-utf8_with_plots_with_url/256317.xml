<plot>What happens when you create a short film with no dialogue and a series of consecutive events culminating in a single conclusion? Now utilize the same entertainment technique in a major motion picture and attempt to engage the viewer from beginning to end. Along the way, incorporate stereotypical characters like a construction worker, a sailor, a cowboy, a doctor, a private investigator, a hunter, a soldier and a naked man. A take on self image as conflict becomes apparent in one's identity. The characters seemingly chase each other through a series of scenes while carrying loaded weapons. Are they chasing each other, chasing themselves or just trying to reach a conclusion? Do the characters represent issues with self image and identity? Are they merely a statement about how the movie industry provides us with multiple persona that we in turn base out own identity on? These are the questions the viewer has to consider while watching this art piece.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256317</url></doc>
