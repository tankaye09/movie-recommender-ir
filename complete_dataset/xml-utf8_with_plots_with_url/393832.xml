<plot>Laura, a pretty, pert 18-year-old, realizes that if she's not married soon, she'll be "the only old maid in the neighborhood!" She spends the summer at her aunt's dude ranch in the mountains with her cousin Elaine. Elaine tells Laura she'd be better off trying to be the "right kind of wife" instead of just any kind of wife. Laura, however, has her sights set on Neal, Elaine's hunky boyfriend, and proceeds to try to steal him from Elaine. Just when she thinks that Neal will propose, he does--to Elaine! Laura realizes that her cousin was right about being the "right kind" of wife (who knows how to change sheets and keep a clean house) and vows to change her ways.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393832</url></doc>
