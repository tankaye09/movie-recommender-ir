<plot>Belmont (Dave Perret) is serving a life sentence for the murder of his wife's lover. Still in contact with his wife and deeply remorseful of his crime Belmont plans an escape to be with her again, to start over. Joining forces with the menacing Ramsey (Dane Giraud) the two bust out making ground across tough New Zealand terrain to their destination, The Waiting Place, a disused psychiatric hospital. It is here that the men must wait for Susie and with her their ride to freedom.
