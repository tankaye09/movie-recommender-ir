<plot>What is the first thing people ask you at a party? What do you do for a living? But did you choose to do this or did it choose you? After graduating college, we are thrown out into the world of interviews only to borrow or rent jobs as we go, hoping to establish a career, but never knowing where it will lead. Welcome to Generation Y! Jobs for Rent follows four 20-somethings in their career paths: the artist, the lawyer, the waitress, and the entrepreneur. Comparisons to the Baby Boomer generation are just the beginning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277849</url></doc>
