<plot>Tourists arrive in the quiet Canadian lake resort Falcon Beach for the season, including nostalgic Ginny Bradshaw and her bitchy daughter Paige, who actually reports to the -fortunately unimpressed- police a 'break-in' by two charming local youngsters, cool water-jock Jason Tanner and his gentle mate Danny Ellis, who only came to borrow electricity for the traditional Start of Summer beach party, which she later gets broken up as 'noise', then followed up by mayor Tallis, who fears 'trouble like last year'. Danny bails out of the tower climbing rite of passage again, he rather skinny-dives. Paige is pissed-off having to stay 'in the wilderness' instead of cramming for an imminent internship at dad Trevor's New York firm, but he doesn't send the info package he promised because of some reorganization; even her big brother in college Lane, who visits later, doesn't know the details. When Jason sees his ex, model Tanya Shedden, finally home from Paris, wants to leave already after a row with her ma Darlene -who just warns not to waste that career and can't pay for college- he generously offers she can stay on the boat he's repairing and temporarily moves back with his own ma Peggy Tanner. Spoiled-rotten ingrate Tanya invites Paige's brother Lane, a fellow party-animal. Bored now her apprenticeship is on hold, Paige commandeers Jason to teach her wake-boarding, then even steals a kiss from the irresistible hunk; yet on land she maintains her haughty aloof act. Danny fears he'll get nowhere with summer-regular Erin because of hippie Scott, but is happily wrong. Tanya takes Lane to her XTC dealer Mook, who strips the boy's studly chest before accepting his $1,000 for 'personal party supplies' of the psychedelic kind. Mayor Tallis's naive son Georgie (14) bought some XTC from the duo -Tanya lied and bitched about it when Jason protested- and got so high he climbs the water-tower, but is afraid to come down; just before brave athletic Jason has reached him, the boy makes a terrible fall. Only their time-honored water fun can somewhat console Jason and Danny, who takes a skinny-dive in the lake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188100</url></doc>
