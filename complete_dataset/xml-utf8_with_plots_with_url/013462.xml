<plot>Aaron is a young man living a lonesome solitary life. One day indistinguishable from the next. Until one day, by chance, he happens upon a woman named Erica. She's the most beautiful woman he's ever laid eyes on and he's immediately smitten. However, considering her "out of his league", he continues on his way with a heavy heart. Though regret over his inability to stop and speak with her will haunt him for the following weeks. Until, by a series of fateful encounters, he gathers the courage to finally approach her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013462</url></doc>
