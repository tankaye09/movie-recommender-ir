<plot>A folk singer comes into a dusty town, sits down and begins to sing about people. One song is about a man coming from far away to the town. At that moment, a man comes home from prison, through the sunflower fields. The folk singer and other townsfolk tell his story, singing about him or talking to him of the past. The young man doesn't speak but tries to go on with his life, following the advice of the local police officer who hands over the roasted seeds shop of his brother-in-law. From that moment on, the young man tries to reconcile with his past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?298619</url></doc>
