<plot>Welcome to the World is a personal immigrant story about a father and a son reunited in New York City after ten years of separation. Shot entirely in Brooklyn with non-professional actors, the film follows them in their first day together: a breakfast in a typical American diner, a late visit to a Mexican tacos bar, and the first night in the father's apartment. Each location expresses the boundaries between Mexican and American culture, but also the nostalgia that entails the immigrant experience. While the father believes his son will follow his steps in becoming a taxi driver, the young man distantly observes his new world and a father that seems a stranger after so many years. A personal and moving insight into the struggles between a boy and his lost father as they attempt to carry on their displaced lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650232</url></doc>
