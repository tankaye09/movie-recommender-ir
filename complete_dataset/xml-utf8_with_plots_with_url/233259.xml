<plot>Shidoshi Chris Carbonaro, together with Crosswind Pictures, releases Volume I of his Bujinkan instructional DVD series, entitled "Heart of the Bujinkan". This DVD not only includes instruction on the core fundamentals of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu/Ninjutsu, the Sanshin no Kata and the Kihon Happo, but also includes an added bonus feature of live training at the Tanuki Dojo in Long Branch, NJ. When asked for the motivation behind the project series, Shidoshi Carbonaro answered, "My main goal was to produce a DVD series that would be an effective supplement to any budoka's training, regardless of rank or time training in this martial art. Future volumes will include more in-depth training in both unarmed techniques and weapons, but no advanced techniques are effective without a strong foundation to build upon. I hope this first DVD can help strengthen that foundation."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233259</url></doc>
