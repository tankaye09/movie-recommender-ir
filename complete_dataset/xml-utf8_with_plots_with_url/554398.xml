<plot>Forty-six hours after Bradley's body was returned from the war in a casket, Jack and Clara Sorrento devise a plan. Honoring their son, they make the pilgrimage to St. Louis , Missouri , to the Gateway Arch, to scatter his ashes-his last request. But there is more. A plot is conceived in the turmoil of grief to avenge the death of their boy by striking one lethal blow at the villain they both determine is the perpetrator of their greatest heartache. Two hundred and eighty-one miles from their home in White House, Tennessee , the object of their rage awaits. So as the miles melt away and Jack and Clara journey along, sanity surrenders to grief on...The Drive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554398</url></doc>
