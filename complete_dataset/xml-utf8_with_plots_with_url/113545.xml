<plot>Nestled in a remote area in northern Ontario resides the reclusive Peter Camani. A high school art teacher and renowned Canadian artist, Peter has been pursuing his dream since the late 1980's. With his paintings already hanging in such coveted places as the Vatican and Buckingham Palace, Peter decided to focus his seemingly limitless energy on realizing a unique vision of significantly larger proportions. Concrete Ambitions, filmed as a day in the life of Peter Camani, documents his attempts to fulfill this remarkable dream. A character both as interesting and uncompromising as his art, Concrete Ambitions introduces us to Peter's singular lifestyle, the sources of his bizarre inspiration and the obstacles encountered along the way to accomplishing his extraordinary goal. Everyone has a dream. Some make them a reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113545</url></doc>
