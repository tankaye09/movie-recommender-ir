<plot>Krishnan Kutty Menon (Nedumudi Venu) is a widower and successful businessman with two sons. His elder son Vipin (Sreenivasan) gets married and after his wedding the younger son Pavan (Dileep) becomes his sole companion good friend. When Anjana (Navya Nair) returns to town now as a foreigner after staying abroad with her parents, she is desperate to take revenge on Pavan, because Pavan used to tease her causing her to drop out of her engineering degree course. But somewhere along the line her feelings toward Pavan turn into love. And as Anjana also gets closer to Menon, Menon starts to dream of her being his daughter-in-law. With a sudden twist in the movie, Sreedevi (Jayasudha) who is Anjana's guardian turns out to be Menon's adolescent love. Navya and Pavan try to reunite them, leading to many comical scenes, and an enjoyable film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269117</url></doc>
