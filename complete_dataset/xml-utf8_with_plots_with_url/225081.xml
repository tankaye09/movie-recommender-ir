<plot>The 11th in the series of 14 "Texas Rangers" westerns from P.R.C. that starred Dave O'Brien and Jim Newill, before Newill was replaced by Tex Ritter in the concluding eight films of a very bad 22-films series: Lillian Wilkins (Jennifer Holt) and her old Civil War Veteran Uncle Jed Wilkins (Budd Buster)own a ranch through which a pipeline will be laid. They are unaware of this but Dan Tyndall (Robert Barron), Joe Hyslop (Bob Kortman) and Tom Binns (Frank McCarroll) are aware of the possibilities for a quick profit and set out to prove through crooked-surveyor Sam Brisco (Jack Ingram)that the land has been improperly surveyed and not rightfully the possession of the Wilkins. They go to family friend and attorney Kendall Lowther (Charles King) for advice and this is not a good move as Lowther is actually the brains behind the scheme to beat them out of their property. But Texas Rangers Tex Wyatt (Dave O'brien) and Jim Steele (Jim Newill) show up to take a hand on the side of the Wilkins. That also means that Panhandle Perkins (Guy Wilkerson), accompained by Lee Zahler's horrific comedy scoring, will also show up. Wilkerson's comedy and Zahler's music is enough to make one root for the villains. This one has so many villains that Bud Osborne is relagated to playing a good guy role.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225081</url></doc>
