<plot>The story of one of the greatest football players and teams of all-time, Tony Latone and the "World Champion" Pottsville Maroons and how against all odds they earned and then lost the 1925 "NFL Championship" - in a still controversial and legendary turn of events. A tale of about the rich and powerful vs. the "little guy", about big cities vs. small rural communities, about pro football as a sport vs. pro football as an industry, about an injustice done to a small coal-mining town that never forgot and never forgave.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583466</url></doc>
