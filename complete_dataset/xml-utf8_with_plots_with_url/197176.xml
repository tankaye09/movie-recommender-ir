<plot>Quite possibly the dullest of all the films in the Monogram series with Johnny Mack Brown and Raymond Hatton, with Hatton in a role normally played by the likes of character actors Steve Clark or Frank LaRue, and excessive footage given to Riley Hill, always capable of bringing a scene to a grinding halt. Rancher Amos Shelby (Raymond Hatton)has one day left to pay off a loan on his ranch, and sends son Freddie (Riley Hill) to tell banker Ainsworth (James E. Logan)that it will be paid on time. Freddie is forced to reveal to gambler Ripley (Ted Adams), to whom he is in debt, that his sister Ann (Jan Bryant)is bringing the money from Silana. Ripley's me waylay the girl and she is rescued by Johnny Mack (Johnny Mack Brown). Ainsworth has Longden (Douglas Evans)forge old man Shelby's signature to predated papers. Johnny gets Shelby's money back from Ripley and kills the gambler gambler when he attempts to take it away from Freddie. Ainsworth informs Amos he is too late to pay his loan and shows him the forged papers. Amos kills one of Longden's henchmen when the gang tries to take over the ranch. Judge Pool (Frank LaRue) sets him free of the murder charge but gives him three days to clear the ranch. Johnny discovers that Ainsworth is after ore he knows is on the ranch property. Henchman Sagebrush (Jack O'Shea) is captured by a ruse, and reveals Ainsworth's plot to Johnny. Freddie is saved from a posse after he robs the bank of a poster revealing Longdon to be a forger. Ainsworth and the gang is captured by Johnny, and Amos recovers his ranch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197176</url></doc>
