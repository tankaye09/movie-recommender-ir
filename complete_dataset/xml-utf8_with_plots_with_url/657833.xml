<plot>WINDFALL is set in the 1930's in gossipy glamorous London with its Bloomsbury Set and dining at the Ritz, Yorkshire, Paris, the South of France and Morocco. It looks at the gay issue - illegal at the time - abortion (also outside of the law), adultery, love lost and found and the age old dilemma of women having to make the choice between career and being wife and mother. A sudden huge legacy, an unimaginable amount of money, dropped into a very ordinary life: what does it do to that life, how can it contain it, how can a balance possibly be maintained?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657833</url></doc>
