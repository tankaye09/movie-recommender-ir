<plot>Using (unattributed and uncredited) the same plot as Columbia's 1930 "Dawn Trail", and Reliable would dust it off again two years later for "Ambush Valley", Sheriff Tom Tracy (Tom Tyler) is summoned to the sheep camp where he finds Old Man Jenkins fatally wounded and, with his dying breath, accuses Ned Hampton (Edmund Cobb), brother of the girl to whom Tom is engaged, Molly (Virginia Brown Faire), of having shot him in the back. Tom goes to the Hampton ranch where Ned claims he shot in self-defense, and then wounds Tom as he escapes. Molly treats the wound and also hides him from the cattlemen, including her father (Charles K. French), who are incensed as they think Tom has taken the side of the sheepmen against them. Tom is forced to take refuge at the sheep camp. Molly rides in and warns Tom that the cattlemen are planning a cattle drive across the sheep lands. Jim Green (Lafe McKee), leader of the sheepmen is determined that the cattle will not cross their land, and holds Molly as a hostage. Tom captures Ned and is taking him back to town when Ned makes a break for the Hampton men on the cattle drive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615158</url></doc>
