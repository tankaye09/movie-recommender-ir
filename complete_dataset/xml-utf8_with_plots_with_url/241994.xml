<plot>Hosted by accomplished outdoorsman and MLB Hall of Fame member Wade Boggs, Hittin' the Outdoors features both mountain and western big game hunting in the US, and throughout the world, as well as the important role hunters' play in wildlife conservation. With the majority of the content being difficult and/or technical mountain hunts, HTO features weekly wild sheep, and other conservation success stories, and dramatic hunts for species seldom seen on traditional outdoor television.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241994</url></doc>
