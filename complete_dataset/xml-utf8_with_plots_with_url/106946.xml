<plot>In recording this picture, the camera was stationed in the centre of the Court of Fountains, which is between the Cascades and the Grand Basin. The scene begins with the lens looking toward the West Mall with the West Amherst gate in the background. The camera is slowly revolved from left to right, taking in the Electricity Building, the base of the Electric Tower, with its exquisite statuary and spouting fountains, passing the Agricultural Building, at the same time showing the Stadium and Canadian Buildings in the background, and finally resting, looking down the East Mall with the East Amherst gate in the extreme background. This picture makes a complete semi-circle and gives as complete a view as one would see it while standing in the center of the Court of Fountains. The picture is greatly enhanced by the immense crowds of people promenading to and fro.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106946</url></doc>
