<plot>See what wows Bowie, tunes in Beck and inspires the Cramps. It's a heart-pumping plunge off a curvy West Virginian highway that leads to the infamous One-Man-Rockabilly-Wild-Man, Hasil Adkins. From Bob Log III, former bus driver turned punk infused Delta Blues band, to Washboard Hank performing on his kitchen-sink tuba, all of the One-Man-Bands documented are undoubtedly the best at what they do, for the simple reason that they are the only ones who can do what they do! Eric Royer's self-built 5-piece Blue Grass band is a long way from his early days playing punk music with Rob Zombie... or is it? Come hear the forbidden rhythms of the Lonesome Organist, Mayor Mc Ca, and the Mysterious Asthmatic Avenger. Witness the world's only One-Man-One-Woman band and be blown away by the King Louie hurricane of sound.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333258</url></doc>
