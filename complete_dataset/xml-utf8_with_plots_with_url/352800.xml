<plot>Plain-looking, buck-toothed Sundar works as a waiter in the Rasraj Hotel. One day he meets with Radha, the daughter of the hotel owner and falls in love with her. She indicates that she likes him, and he builds a palace of dreams, but lacks the confidence to approach her. When his friend, Amar, returns from abroad he assists him in making a career as a Bollywood comedian and singer, and improving his self-worth. Sundar gets popularity virtually overnight, and musters up enough courage to propose to Radha, only to find out that she loves someone else, and that person is none other than - Amar.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352800</url></doc>
