<plot>In a small quiet town in the Northeast of England, there is a murder. A sports journalist who hates sport quits his job. A bouncer is fired for "bouncing". And a girl is jilted at the altar. These seemingly random events spiral together when the three accidentally bump into each other in the same pub; as the girl drowns her sorrows, the writer works on a crime script, and the bouncer starts talking... little did they know that someone was listening. Now all three are entangled with a beautiful widow, a suitcase full of money, an ever-increasing body-count, and a dubious pint of semi-skimmed. Will the bouncer ever get his hands on the money? Will the bride ever find out what happened to her husband-to-be? Will the writer ever live down last year's under-12s 5-a-side mascot fiasco? Will they even survive a murder case they're not supposed to be involved in? Soon all will be revealed, and delivered straight to your doorstep!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666683</url></doc>
