<plot>In this scene a couple of city dudes are trying to make an impression upon a pretty country maid, who is tripping along the highway. They follow her for some time, and are just attempting to speak to her when the village policeman gets a kiss from the pretty girl as his reward. An interesting effect is obtained in this picture as they walk along.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345460</url></doc>
