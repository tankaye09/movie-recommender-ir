<plot>Lip, Windy, Sharbet, Thiana, Ruby, Elias, Flare, Neris, and Selen are all faeries that live in a magical kingdom. One day, the world was invaded by evil monsters, and all of the faeries except for Lip were put under an evil spell. To break the magic, Lip must compete against her friends in the faeries' favorite puzzle game. Players control a cursor that switches a horizontal pair of panels. If at least three of the same color of panel are lined up in a horizontal or vertical row (called a combo), then those panels are eliminated. The stack of panels keeps rising upward. To drop garbage pieces on your opponent, you must make several combos in succession (called a chain). If your stack of panels gets too high, the game is over. The game also includes a tutorial and other variations of the endless "marathon" mode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421612</url></doc>
