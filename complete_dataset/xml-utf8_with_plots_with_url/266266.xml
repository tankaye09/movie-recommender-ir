<plot>Once World War II was over, the MG Car Company hurried back into car production with the MGTC. Steel was rationed and England needed an infusion of foreign currency. The MG Car Company turned to the export markets and a decades-long love affair began between America and the little British sports car. From cars based on prewar designs to the futuristic Roaring Raindrop and the beloved MGB, MGs were synonymous with fun and excitement until the end came in 1980 when British Leyland closed the MG Factory in England.
