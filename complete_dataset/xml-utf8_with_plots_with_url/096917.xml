<plot>An interview style mockumentary about the treatment of union vs. non-union actors on film and television sets, with dramatization of their stories during the interview. The union and non-union actors relationship with one another on set and what they are like off set. This mockumentary will follow a fictitious movie shoot where the cast is being interviewed by a fictitious documentary filmmaker who is interested in the treatment of non-union actors. The documentary filmmaker also takes footage of the movie shoot just to give an example of what the non-union actor goes through in a typical day on set. The interviewer will be asking the cast and some of the crewmembers questions regarding the actors. The camera will also follow one of the non-union actors home to show how they make their little salary work for them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096917</url></doc>
