<plot>Canals are part of our cultural heritage but today, what was the commercial network of the industrial revolution, has become the leisure playground of boat-owners and holiday-makers who wish to take the time to discover the wealth and beauty of the canal system. A holiday on board a narrowboat is a perfect way to see what life afloat is all about. If setting off at the tiller of a 60-foot narrowboat is a little daunting, this programme is just the introduction you need as we look at how to handle a boat, the things to take care over and safety requirements, as well as navigation, planning and buying supplies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014139</url></doc>
