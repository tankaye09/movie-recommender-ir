<plot>A documentary about the private (partly) and public life of Franklin D. Roosevelt who, despite his physical handicap, was elected President of the United States four times, compiled primarily from newsreels. His work during the depression years, when he created Federal agencies such as the W.P.A., C.C.C., N.R.A., P.W.A. and others is covered, plus a large portion of the film covers his years as a wartime leader. Also shown are scenes he didn't live to see, the unconditional surrender of the Germans and the Japanese. The musical background is a new symphony, "Toward the Sun", by Earl Robinson.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?587727</url></doc>
