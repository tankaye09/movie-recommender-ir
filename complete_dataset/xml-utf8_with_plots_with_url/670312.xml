<plot>In 2004, the government announced the successful creation of Stiver Island, an artificial island off the coast built as a test for creating islands all over the world. One year later, Keith, a news reporter on his way to his first assignment on Stiver Island, barely survives a horrific earthquake that destroys the monorail he is riding on, falling unconscious. He awakens an unknown amount of time later to find the city all but deserted, and rescue operations are underway as Stiver Island slowly begins to sink into the ocean. Keith must make it through the collapsing city, meeting unusual people and uncovering a terrible plot to destroy the city. Only if he survives will he be able to write his disaster report.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670312</url></doc>
