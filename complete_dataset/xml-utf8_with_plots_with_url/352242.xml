<plot>Maharaja Purshotam Singh rules over his kingdom justly and fairly. He lives in his palace with his wife, Ahilya, an adult son, and a new-born son, Ajay. His biggest concern is the evil Maharudra, who has taken it upon himself to conquer the region and rule over it mercilessly. Purshotam's armies are no match for Maharudra, even his son is killed, so Purshotam leads the rest of his men, leading to their massacre and his death. Maharudra takes over the region and other Kings surrender to his might. Years later, Maharudra is still the ruler, quite unknown to him, his enemies are multiplying and are organizing a war against him. They are Rajkumar Ajay Singh, the son of slain Purshotam, his friend, Pratap Singh; Padmini, Pratap's lover; and Madhuri who has to settle several scores with Maharudra. And against these brave men and women are Maharudra himself, his vast armies, and Vetal, an indestructible demon from the very depths of hell, who has been resurrected to kill Maharudra's enemies once and for all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352242</url></doc>
