<plot>"The people on the block decided definitely that Jules was crazy when they heard about his composition. There had been suspicions for a long time. He made people shiver with his blank stare. His coarse guttural tongue sounded unnatural in his frail body. The paleness of his skin upset many children. It seemed to hang loose around his flesh. People declared it common knowledge that he was born on a night when the winds uprooted trees..." - Richard Matheson, 1951 Adapted from the 1951 short story by legendary horror and science fiction writer RICHARD MATHESON, BLOOD SON is an unorthodox coming-of-age story of a teenager who, obsessed with vampirism gleaned from literature and ostracized from his family and community, finally finds his identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075538</url></doc>
