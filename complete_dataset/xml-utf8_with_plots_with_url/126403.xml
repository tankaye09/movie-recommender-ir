<plot>"Danny" is the story of a 16 year old boy being physically abused by his alcoholic father. He hasn't had a close, caring relationship in his life since his mother was killed in an automobile accident when he was 5. His life is consumed with the abuse and trying to keep his father at bay. Shy and reserved, he has a hard time making friends. He can't really understand why anyone would want to be friends with him anyway. Danny's life begins to change when he meets Justin, 16, his new neighbor. As their friendship grows, Danny begins to open up and feel some sense of being 'normal'. Their friendship may also be becoming something more. Just when Danny is starting to come out of his shell, things with his father take a turn for the worse forcing Danny to make dire choices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126403</url></doc>
