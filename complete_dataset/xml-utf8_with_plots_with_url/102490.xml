<plot>This picture is one of the most novel ever presented in motion photography. The film shows the fire boat at work with all of the nozzles in full play and the effects of the columns of water rising from the bow of the boat is grand. The action of the wind causes the columns to spray out until they look like bunches of feathers blowing in the wind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102490</url></doc>
