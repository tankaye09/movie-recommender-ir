<plot>The sport of gymnastics has been around for nearly 2000 years - its notable beginnings during the golden years of ancient Greece, but as a modern competitive sport, its history is only a little over 100 years old. Never the less, it's also one of the most popular athletic activities for those youngsters more interested in athletics as art, rather than combat. In the tradition of their hugely popular LITTLE WARRIORS and LITTLE PUGS, Baikal Films once again brings us into the captivating world of young East European athletes in their latest release, GYM BOYS. Here, a small group of adolescent pals from the Ukraine are gracefully balancing their everyday lives with the more precarious pursuit of life atop parallel bars. Like boys the world over, they live for the adrenaline rush that only physical play can provide, but also as good sons first, there will always be chickens to feed and dad's car to wash before the fun begins. And what more fun can there be than stripping down to your muscle-baring singlet and shorts, then strutting your skills for the judges in a local competition. Without a doubt, these boys are in exquisite form - both mentally and physically. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you thrill to their awe-inspiring maneuvers in GYM BOYS. (Includes great up-close and personal interviews with the athletes).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225716</url></doc>
