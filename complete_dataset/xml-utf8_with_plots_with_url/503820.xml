<plot>Philippine-Canadian JD Santos is a competitive player of Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), an arcade video game that pits gamers against each other as they step on flashing arrows to the beat of Japanese dance music. Addicted to life in the arcade, JD eats, sleeps and plays DDR and that's the arena in which he met most of his friends, including wisecracking BFF (and costar) Jen. JD's never won a single competition, but his opportunity to prove himself arrives with the Mississauga Playdium Tournament, a showdown between 25 boys and girls, aged 12 to 30, competing for reputation - and an Xbox 360. But will JD buckle under pressure when Jen starts flirting with an arch-nemesis from Montreal?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503820</url></doc>
