Tommy invites his whole gang to hear Dr. Hendricks explain the importance of dental health and how dental disease can be controlled. Dr. Hendricks tells a fascinating story. He talks about mouth hygiene, dental care and the role foods play in protecting dental health. Tommy and his friends learn the facts, and the care of their teeth and health takes on a new, highly important light. As for Jim, he profits, too.
