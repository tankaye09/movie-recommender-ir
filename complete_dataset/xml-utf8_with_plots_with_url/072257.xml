<plot>Thirteen years ago, James Malick killed Marion Smith's son - she knows it. But the courts didn't quite see it that way. Today, Malick is released and Marion is approached by a stranger who gives her and others the chance to meet with Malick. The stranger brings Malick to them, bound and gagged, and he testifies to them that Marion was right all along. Because of double jeopardy, the kidnapper warns that Malick can never be brought to justice again for this crime. He hands Marion the same weapon used to kill her son, a baseball bat, in the only chance for justice she may ever get. The question is: will she use it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072257</url></doc>
