<plot>Two Bros and a job gone-wrong: the outcome....annihilation. Frank and Sal are two Montreal gangsters living the average suburban life. One is lost in a dull marriage; the other is smothered by his mothers' strong will. When Frank and Sal meet up for a regular day of work in the cold streets of Montreal, their personality quirks make a simple deal with the Ukrainian gangsters end in bloodshed. Then, after a routine trip to their favorite deli to feed their big appetites they are ready to return to their simple domestic lives, but as usual things do not go as planned. Frank and Sal confront a homeless man and three hoods, revealing just how irritable and bored these Bros really are. Faster than one can say "meatball", another victim is lying dead, along with three unlucky witnesses. As they return home, we see that these two Bros are not only trying to survive in the world of gangsters, but struggle to stay alive in their mundane suburban lives. This is a new take on the dream of a gangster's life in Montreal with a twist of reality and humor. This plate of meatballs is overcooked and sizzling with rage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084295</url></doc>
