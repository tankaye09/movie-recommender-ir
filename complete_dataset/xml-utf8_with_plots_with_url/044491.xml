<plot>The main theme of ARAHET is emigration, a huge worldwide problem of many nations. There are a lot of emotional psychological solutions in the film concerning friendship, love, patriotism, human relations and other issues. An Armenian guy Avetik by name who lives in the USA, once finds a small path near a huge high-speed freeway. A path which takes him straight to his motherland. This is the dream of any emigrant... The further development of this surreal drama is a conflict between the present and the past, real friendship and relationships, love and disappointment. The realities of modern American life are relieved in the movie through the conversations of Los Angeles taxi-cab passengers of different backgrounds. This is a movie good not only for national but also international audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044491</url></doc>
