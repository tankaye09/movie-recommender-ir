<plot>Patrick McKay and Vincent Danzig both grew up together but took different paths in life. McKay became a policeman and is now one of those being considered for the soon to be vacated position of police commissioner, while Danzig became a criminal. And there has been a feud brewing ever since McKay's son, Patrick Jr. was killed and it's strongly believed that the Danzigs were the ones who did it. Now that McKay is on the verge of being appointed Danzig has his son do everything he can to have McKay discredited so that he won't be appointed. Part of his plan is to set up McKay's other son, Frank's partner, Mickey as being on the take. So, Frank goes out to try and prove that Mickey was set up. And if that weren't enough, McKay's granddaughter, Liz, a rookie cop, was there when she and some other police officers arrested a young black man, now the black man died, so the black community wants to sue the city for brutality and seek out McKay's other son, Matt, a lawyer to handle the case.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417497</url></doc>
