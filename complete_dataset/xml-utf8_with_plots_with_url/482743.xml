<plot>When the fishing tugs mentioned in the description of the picture, "fishing at Farralone Islands," are returning to San Francisco, the fishermen cast into the sea tons of unmarketable fish. We secured a picture of this occurence and thousands and thousands of seagulls are seen flying about and diving down into the water and fighting and wrangling as the fish are thrown overboard. Here is also a picture which will undoubtedly never be secured again. It is most marvelous and beautiful, and we recommend it to every exhibitor as a picture that is invaluable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482743</url></doc>
