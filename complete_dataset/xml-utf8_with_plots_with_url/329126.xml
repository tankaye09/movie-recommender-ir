<plot>Her birthday is only a day away and young seven year old Caleb needs just three dollars and seventy five cents more to purchase her favorite flowers as a gift. He's been working hard for over a month at his lemonade stand to raise the money, but he needs to take it out just one more time in hopes of obtaining the difference. But it's Friday afternoon and his usual place of business, the local soccer fields normally plagued with thirsty players, are empty. Will it be a Happy Birthday? For Caleb and his special girl, there will never be anything else.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329126</url></doc>
