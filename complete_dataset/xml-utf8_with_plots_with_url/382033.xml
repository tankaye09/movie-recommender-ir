<plot>MUREX is the compelling story of a ten year old living in a city devastated by war in the Middle East who finds an ancient Phoenician amulet by the sea and is approached by a mysterious fisherman, who comes from the dark side. The boy is forced to make an unholy pact with the fisherman in order to save his own life and world destruction. The one proviso in the pact for the boy is as long as he keeps the amulet safe; he and the rest of the world are safe. However, if he loses it, which he does, the fisherman returns and the beginning of the end of the world are imminent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382033</url></doc>
