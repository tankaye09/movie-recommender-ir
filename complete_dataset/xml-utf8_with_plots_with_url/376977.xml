<plot>25 years ago on the 8th December 1980 John Lennon was shot by Mark David Chapman. This documentary shows the parallels between the murderer and his idol, asks the question, why a former fan (Chapman) began to hate his idol and finally killed him. In archive footage of interviews on audio tapes Chapman talks about his motives. Psychologists and confidants of Chapman debate on possible reasons of his act. Frederic Seaman, a friend of John Lennon, gives insights of Lennons life behind the curtains.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376977</url></doc>
