<plot>Dr. Mel Tonken's city veterinary practice is far from the little clinic in the placid countryside of James Herriot's Yorkshire Dales. The urban jungle of Toronto demands a wilder kind of animal medicine and more unusual prescriptions. This is a documentary film which will reveal the wacky but true tale of a vet, a bizarre collection of animal owners and the pets that bring them together. When King the boisterous Bouvier and Honey the chocolate Siamese help to ignite an unlikely romance between their owners, the vet and his team play at matchmaking. But Honey swallows the wedding ring, and it's up to Dr. Tonken to save the cat-and the marriage. From Bartholomew the poodle and Sunny the chicken to Muscles the python, the good doctor's patience are only slightly less eccentric than their owners.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040760</url></doc>
