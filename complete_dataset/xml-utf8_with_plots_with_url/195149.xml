<plot>Fine Living and CNET bring you the Ultimate Home Entertainment Upgrade. The special has the look and feel of Home Entertainment itself: shooting High Def in a 16:9 aspect ratio, with a visual and editorial style and graphics that reflect the worlds of cinema, DVD, games and online. Focusing on lifestyle and room design as much as the technology that lives within it, this special is chock full of useful takeaway information. Two very different households are taken through the process of a home entertainment upgrade at two different budget levels. At a budget of $25,000 the couple in their hip loft space employ experts to design and install their state of the art plasma screen HDTV with surround sound. At a budget of $5,000 the couple in their pre-fab modern home do it themselves, with a little help from host and CNET.com expert Brian Cooley. Each end up with a satisfying HDTV/surround sound system that can really rock the house.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195149</url></doc>
