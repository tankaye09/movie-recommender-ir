<plot>Seung-pyo is blinded by his ambition--so much so that he neglects his wife and family. Meeting the director of his company, Seung-pyo realizes that he needs to win him over if he wants to succeed in that business. He arranges for his wife to spend as much private time as possible with the director in the hopes that this will win him favor from the boss.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126175</url></doc>
