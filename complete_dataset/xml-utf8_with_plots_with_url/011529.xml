<plot>This disturbing and controversial experimental film tells the story of 28-year-old Ray Garcia, whose abusive upbringing still affects him deeply. His personal history growing up in a violent family, compounded with the barrage of violence he views on television, pushes him over the edge. In the end, he contemplates committing violent crimes himself. A History of Violence questions the power that familial and media violence has on both individuals and our culture at large.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011529</url></doc>
