<plot>Extr@ is a language-learning sitcom broadcast in many countries. The success and innovation of the series is that it combines real learning with a genuinely entertaining, sophisticated and sometimes risqu√© sitcom format that appeals to the 'Friends' generation. Two young women share a flat in the city. They have a neighbor who fancies himself, and one of the women. She doesn't return his affection, but her flatmate does. Their landlady has very strict guidelines for the tenants and she regularly checks up on them. Into the mix comes a naive outsider from another culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186005</url></doc>
