<plot>Snake River runs through the great boom city of Nome, Alaska. It sprang to a population of 3,500 in thirty days in 1900. This view was made in the middle of winter, and shows "Malamoot" and "Huskie" dog teams; also skaters, cyclists, women on skis, and Eskimo women fishing for cod through holes in the ice. Nome City is seen in the background.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658404</url></doc>
