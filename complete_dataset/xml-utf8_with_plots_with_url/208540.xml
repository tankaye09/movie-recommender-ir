<plot>Gahanna Bill chronicles the life of Bill Withrow; a middle-aged, mentally handicapped man. Living in the small, suburban town of Gahanna, Ohio, Bill's unique relationship over the years with the town, its residents, and its local high school are all captured in this emotionally powerful film. Told from the people that knew him best, Bill's fascinating story is an interesting look into how one man's life can be an inspiration for so many, and how someone with a disability can overcome obstacles and make an impact in their everyday life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208540</url></doc>
