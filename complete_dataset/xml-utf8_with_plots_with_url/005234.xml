<plot>The series is a comedy that follows the misadventures of Gwen Morgan, a 35-year-old actress living in Los Angeles. The woman is a walking contradiction--she's intelligent, but naive (especially when it comes men) and she's a loyal friend, but can be self-centered and oblivious. Maggie and Martin are Gwen's twenty-something best friends. Both are geeks and sci-fi fans who can't go a day without making a reference to Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, etc. Since Gwen is a child of the 80's and seriously challenged when it comes to all things hip, the two have to work hard to keep her in the 21st century. Gwen is a magnet for drama, so they also do their best to keep her out of trouble. Re-occurring characters include Alistair McCrackin, a loud, irritable Scotsman. He's a genius with a weakness for women and always broke because of it. Not to be left out is an unnamed, ill-mannered video store clerk who turns out to be quite ubiquitous. He's the loser with ten dead-end jobs and he's everywhere. In the pilot episode, Gwen's 10-year acting career is still going nowhere and her personal life is no better. This is the day her life finally falls apart. The low-budget horror script (starring herself of course) that she's been working on since she moved to Los Angeles is suddenly gone and her hottie part-time bartender boyfriend just dumped her. Luckily, Gwen's two great friends, Maggie and Martin, stick by her side and help her in the quest to find her script, her boyfriend and herself.</plot><plot>The series is a comedy that follows the misadventures of Gwen Morgan, a 35-year-old actress living in Los Angeles.
