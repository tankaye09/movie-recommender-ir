<plot>Sudhakar Patel meets with young Anju and both fall in love with each other. Hoping to get married soon, both get intimate, resulting in a pregnancy. Both do not have the means to look after a child and decide to abort it. After the abortion Sudhakar disappears from Anju's life. Sudhakar relocates to another town, falls in love with Chameli, and promises to marry her when confronted by her irate father and townspeople, but subsequently disappears from her life also. Sudhakar then has an affair with Laxmi, who is the wife of his friend, Prakash, and gets a sound beating from Prakash when he finds him half-naked in his house. Shortly thereafter Sudhakar marries Nirmala, a young woman who wanted to marry her tutor. Years later, Sudhakar is still married to Nirmala, he now has two daughters, Geeta and Charu, who are of marriageable age and having affairs with Ajit and Deepak respectively. Their next door neighbor is Kamla Thakur who is to get married to Bhaskar soon, but kills herself by throwing herself from the 5th floor of her apartment building. This suicide shakes up the entire Patel family and each one must deal with their individual demons - a struggle that may change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?285639</url></doc>
