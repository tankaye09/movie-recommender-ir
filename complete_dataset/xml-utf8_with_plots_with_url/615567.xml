<plot>Trails of Water is an experimental film about a young boy's emotion as seen through his make-believe story. His story is about Galeno who struggles to survive in his everyday life by fetching water as a living near the mining site. His village is then caught in a mass paranoia where everyone is suspicious of a newcomer in the village. This resulted in a killing phenomenon. No one knows who the person is until the stranger reveals himself to Galeno.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615567</url></doc>
