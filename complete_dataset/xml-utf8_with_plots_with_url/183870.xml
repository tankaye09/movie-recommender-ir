<plot>"Evaporated" chronicles the heart-breaking stories of four people, their lives devastated after years of smoking. Two of whom had to go onto 24 hour a day oxygen, one had to have his voice box removed as a result of cancer, and a 54-year-old woman who couldn't leave her hospital bed, and for whom nothing more could be done except giving her morphine for pain. She died shortly after the video was produced, and the others soon began to follow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183870</url></doc>
