<plot>After a mostly enjoyable morning feeding the baby animals on her family's farm, four-year old Cora Davis falls asleep as she waits for her brother and sister to return home from school. During her nap, she encounters one baby animal after another wandering far from the safety of their families. Cora is troubled by this and decides to help each of the lost babies find their way home. As dreams sometime go, Cora has no luck finding the mothers of these little ones, and when seeking help, realizes her own mother is missing. These surprising problems are soon resolved with the help of a kindly, but enchanted neighbor lady. When Cora awakens from her troubling dream she is grateful to be surrounded by her brother and sister at a perfectly lovely tea party prepared by her very own, loving mother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338495</url></doc>
