<plot>Shekawat is unhappy that his parents have willed their estate, and wealth to his sister, Sonali, and her husband, Pramod. He devises a plot which will enable him to get the wealth. His sister gives birth to a son, and Pramod overhears him instructing his men to kill the child, and runs away with him. His men run Pramod down, and believe they killed him, but Pramod survives and hands the child, Amit, over to Sudha and her husband, who already have a daughter named Ayusha. Pramod then goes into a coma. Shekhawat gets his sister to sign over the estate in his name, and marries a wealthy but devout woman named Shobha, who subsequently gives birth to a son named Babla. Years later, the children have now grown up. Ayusha and Babla are attracted to each other, and their respective families approve of their marriage. The only one who is opposed to this marriage is Pramod, who has now recovered, only to find out that he must first go through Amit, his very own son, who is not prepared to believe any story against Shekhawat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025991</url></doc>
