<plot>This documentary examines the life and flying career of Amelia Earhart, with special attention to her disappearance near Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean during her 1937 around-the-world flight. Theories run the gamut from serious to crackpot: she and her co-pilot Fred Noonan became lost due to navigational error, crashed in the ocean and died immediately; they were stranded on another nearby island and eventually died after perhaps trying to radio for help; they were captured by the Japanese military and she was later executed for being a spy; she is still alive and living today in New Jersey; she was abducted by aliens. Most intriguingly, an archaeological group has recently visited nearby Nikumaroro (formerly Gardner) Island and found artifacts--pieces of aluminum aircraft skin and the sole and heel of a woman's shoe, apparently the same size and type that Amelia wore. The search continues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578039</url></doc>
