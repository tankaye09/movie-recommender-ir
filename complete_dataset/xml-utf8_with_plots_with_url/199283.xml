<plot>Foolish Girl premiered on the C.B.C.'s alternative pop culture program ZeD. Act 1 of Foolish Girl appeared on the February 9th episode, act 2, 3, and 4 followed from February 10th through to the 12th. Capping the week off, the Foolish Girl pilot was shown in its entirety on Friday February 13th, 2004. Based on the Alternative comic by Vesna Mostovac, it's the character with her finger on the pulse of turn-of-the-millennium relationships, neuroses and angst. It's Foolish Girl. Foolish Girl is an animated slice of life for city-drenched youth. In a time when everything is controlled by boomer parents, Foolish Girl and her urbanite buddies just want to find a place that feels good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199283</url></doc>
