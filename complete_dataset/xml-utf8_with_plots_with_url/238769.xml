<plot>"This film is one that will bring forth more praise than anyone can imagine. Those who took part in it are seen to climb to an elevation of about 25 feet in the air and deliberately dive into the water. They are most venturesome, and you feel as though someone would eventually get hurt. This is not the case, however. After diving from their high perch in every conceivable manner, they attempt to crawl out on the greasy pole which extends at least 50 feet out over the water, but they slip off before they can reach the end. Some lose their balance and fall overboard on their backs. There are six men and two women in the group. One fellow, more nimble than the rest, succeeds in walking out to the extreme end, and dives over much to his own satisfaction and that of the audience. A bright, brilliant and sunny picture, full of life and vim."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238769</url></doc>
