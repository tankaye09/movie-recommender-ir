<plot>After losing his father, mother and crippled brother during a deadly robbery by unruly outlaws, JAKE (early 20's) is left to tend to the family ranch by himself -- and he won't have it any other way. In a high stakes poker game, JAKE agrees to allow a friend of the family's farmhand to move onto the ranch to assist in the duties that he can't handle on his own. There's just one minor detail that was left out when the deal was made: the farmhand is a girl... a Native American girl. As the two butt heads -- and cultures -- their differences begin to melt away, and a sincere love blossoms. With the help of a long-lost brother and a faithful cousin, JAKE and his forbidden love fight through tough times, and even tougher consequences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479834</url></doc>
