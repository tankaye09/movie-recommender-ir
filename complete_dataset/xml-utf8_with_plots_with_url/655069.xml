<plot>On April 21, 2004, Mordechai was released from prison. Mordechai Vanunu, Israel's nuclear "whistle-blower," received an eighteen-year prison sentence, eleven of which were in solitary confinement. Eighteen years after being imprisoned, Vanunu's story is told in this multi-faceted drama that attempts to penetrate the persona of one of the most vilified people in Israeli history. The film describes Vanunu's life story, dwelling on the major crossroads of his life, beginning with his immigration from Morocco and his childhood in the impoverished "Neighborhood D", of Beer Sheva, and continuing through to his recent release from prison. The film focuses on the personal side and human drama. Director Nissim Mossek, who has been documenting the Vanunu affair for the last seventeen years, obtained access to exclusive information and material.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655069</url></doc>
