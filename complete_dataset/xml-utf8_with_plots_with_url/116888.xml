<plot>Raphael and his best friend Victor rob a convenient store in East Los Angeles, and what was planned to be a routine robbery turns out ugly. While fleeing the scene, the two hit a dog in the road. They both get chased by the cops, Offifer Duncan and Officer Ruiz. Raphael decides he must save the dog and bring it to safety, which might alleviate some of his mounting guilt from the nights earlier events.
