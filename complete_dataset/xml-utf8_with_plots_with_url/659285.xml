<plot>In the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, this country saw the mobilization of some of the largest Street Protests in our nation's history. Here and around the world Millions of people poured into the streets demanding the U.S. not attack Iraq. This public outcry against the war coalesced in the largest day of international protest in world history, February 15, 2003. The message was clear "Do not attack Iraq." President George W. Bush dismissed these massive protests as a 'focus group." Witness a Peace Movement was shot over a two year period during the birth, and formative years of the revitalized Anti-War Movement. Filmed with a hand-held guerrilla style this film documents the voices of a cross section of Americans who protest in the streets against, or in support of, the War in Iraq.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659285</url></doc>
