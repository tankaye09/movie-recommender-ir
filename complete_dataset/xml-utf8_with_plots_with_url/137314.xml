<plot>Nino Holm was a member of the most successful Austrian pop-formation "EAV" during the 1980ies. He lived his dream and built a Columbus-like galleon named Barutheela in the Indian Ocean of the Maldives, especially equipped for diving-adventures. The life on board a reminder of the discovery of America as wells as the completely new life of the former famous musician Nino Holm. Special diving-guest on board is the famous Austrian director Rudi Dolezal, known for his music-videos, for example for Freddy Mercury and Queen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?137314</url></doc>
