<plot>Carey Wilson, at least during this period of his life, was a strong believer of psychic phenomena and the spiritualism school of thought. This gave rise to a series of "MGM Miniature" shorts under the collective title of "What Do You Think?" In this one, a young man sees his wife in the company of a supposed (in his mind) rival, and is on his way to kill him when he, talking to an elderly stranger, has a psychic experience that dissuades him from the act of murder. Good thing, as his wife was innocent. Wilson, as the narrator, asks the audience what they thought (reference psychic intervention) and some thought this ten minute short was about ten minutes too long.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651561</url></doc>
