<plot>Toppo is a loud-mouthed, out-of-work actor who dreams of becoming a famous star in Seoul. However, he quickly experiences a setback and returns to Japan where he meets a female con artist named Nene. His involvement in big-time crime begins when he stumbles upon a much sought after treasure, a Korean incense burner said to be valued at 1 billion yen.
