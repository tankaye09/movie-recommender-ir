<plot>New Hampshire, 1972: Will Murphy, fledgling restaurant mogul, amateur lounge singer and go-go bar owner is stumbling after his own version of the American Dream. He's got big plans and all the reckless passion he needs to follow them through. His life is a whirl of seedy bars, seedier girlfriends and a wife two towns away. Hope looms on the horizon though: he's closing in fast on his dream of opening a four-star restaurant in North Conway. But Will's drive for the brass ring hits a last-minute obstacle when his mistress suddenly vanishes - with the capital for his latest plans for expansion. To pull him out of his now dangerous financial predicament Will turns to his wealthy In-Laws, spinning a myriad of desperate lies, half-truths and deceptions. When they come through, Will is left with a decision. Continue his chosen path? Or start anew?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400507</url></doc>
