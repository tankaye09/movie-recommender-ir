<plot>Baseball. The Chicago Giants, led by rooster pitcher Dizzy Dan, are playing the Hicksville team. Dan arrives in Hicksville and sings the title song while eyeing local pitcher Claude's girl. The game. Showboat Dan throws two strikes so hard his catcher is thrown backwards; the turtle catcher uses a stovepipe to send the third strike back to Dan. A Giant batter hits the ball; the Hicksville pitcher loses it in a hailstorm of balls. The Giant batter, a weiner dog, manages to touch two bases at once, thus stretching his hit into a homer. Dan, showboating, lets two strikes go by, then when he hits, preens a while before running, but he still makes his run. Bottom of the ninth, 3-0, 2 outs, Hicksville pitcher Claude at bat. Arrogantly, Dan has walked three batters just to get to him, so bases are loaded. After missing a fast ball and a slow ball, Claude hits his grand-slam homer and keeps his girl, laughing in Dan's face.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080568</url></doc>
