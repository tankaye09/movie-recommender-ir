<plot>A study of human relationships. A man lands on a bare, wooden floor, a red-brick wall behind him. From time to time, things fall to the floor from above. Eventually, he has a chair, a table, music, and cigarettes. Then, a woman lands in the space. They ease up to each other. They laugh, they sleep together. He's spirited away a key; she's hidden a pistol. A door appears in their space. Can they negotiate? There are intimations that we are peering into a human aquarium.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?300936</url></doc>
