<plot>On an ordinary train into work, without a thought to anyone, Molly suddenly felt overwhelmed to leave her life. Now upon her return she must face the world she was so desperate to leave behind. At the center of the conflict is her mother. A woman steeped in an Irish tradition that gave birth to generations of redheaded Mollies, Red Mollies. Molly Mulligan McEvoy is the last of the Red Mollies, a burden Molly can't outrun. To avoid the media, Molly hides away in her mother's house. Molly and her Mother's confrontations start to tear away the layers of Molly's current psychological state. But these confrontations are often interrupted by Molly's descent into her unconscious mind where two other worlds vie for Molly's attention.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458228</url></doc>
