<plot>No Place To Hide is the story of a young married woman Asma who is gang raped by a group of army officers. When she attempts to seek justice she is intimidated, harassed and her husband is murdered. Under trying circumstances Asma escapes the country with her daughter and comes to Toronto. Here she finds out that life is not as easy and welcoming as General Musharraf had claimed. Besides her uphill struggle to survive in Canada, Asma has to deal with immigration authorities and prove her legitimacy. Moreover, an agent pretending to be an attorney dupes Asma of all her means. In response to Asma's outrage at having been swindled the agent takes her to an attorney. The attorney reviews her case but is unable to assist because by then, General Musharraf's remarks had made her situation incredible and insignificant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398533</url></doc>
