<plot>This picture shows the Governor General, the Earl of Minto, accompanied by the Countess of Minto and their household, crossing the river in ice canoes. On the Quebec side the canoes find a solid ledge of ice projecting about 200 yards from the wharf, and over this the blanket clad snow shoers haul the Governor, his wife and guests. A very excellent picture of the Governor General of Canada clad in his winter travelling costume.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046140</url></doc>
