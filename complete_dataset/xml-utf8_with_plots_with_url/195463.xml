<plot>As danced by Loie Fuller. A very artistic and interesting film. The dance is executed with the famous ten-yard skirts invented for the wonderful fire dance which had such a phenomenal run at Koster and Bial's, New York City. This is the most suitable film for coloring, and when colored it produces all the wonderful effects that are seen in the original fire dance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195463</url></doc>
