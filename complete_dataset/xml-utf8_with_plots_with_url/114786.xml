<plot>Ryan Valken has finally decided to move forward with his life, asking his girlfriend Andrea to marry him. Andrea happily accepts, but there is still a great weight hanging over Ryan. Ryan still hasn't received his father's blessing of his decision. Ryan meets his Father at the church, where his father presides.. Their conversation begins casual, but soon turns to the issue at hand. Ryan let's the Minister know that he's engaged. He is met with a stern warning. Andrea is leading him down the path to hell. Ryan insists that his love is genuine. The Minister asks Ryan to bring her to his next Sermon. Ryan asks Andrea to attend. Andrea tells Ryan she doesn't feel comfortable there due to her past experiences with the Church. She reluctantly agrees to go. Arriving at the church, Ryan and Andrea are greeted by Minister Valken. They take their seats and the sermon begins. In the sermon, Minister Valken speaks on the topic of spiritual purity and the evils of fornication outside of marriage. Quoting the Apostle Paul, the Minister directs a chastising verse in Andrea's direction. Unwilling to listen, Andrea leaves. Ryan follows. Catching Andrea on the way out, Ryan argues with Andrea as to the meaning of the sermon. Feeling betrayed, Andrea leaves and breaks off the engagement. Not knowing how to handle this, Ryan explodes. Having lost everything, Ryan confronts his father about his methods and their relationship in an ultimate conclusion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114786</url></doc>
