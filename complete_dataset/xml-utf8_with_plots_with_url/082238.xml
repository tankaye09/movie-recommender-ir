<plot>Del Courtney and Orchesta leads off with "Symphony Moderne" and concludes with "Second Hugarian Rhapsody" and then shows their versatility by providing the music while The Town Criers sing "Just a-Sittin' and a-Rockin'"; Dottie Dotson does double duty on "Knock Me a Kiss" and "Do You Believe in Loving, Honey", and Universal dance director Louis Da Pron tap-dances to Stephen Foster's "Swanee River." This carried a production number of 1311, which Universal, either short of imagination or lost the count number, used the same number again on a 1955 short with the Ink Spots and the Barry Sisters. For those, if any, who track such, make this 1311-1946 and the other one 1311-1955. Warners recycled footage in their Shorts and Universal went one better by recycling footage and numbers. Columbia would just reissue the original and put a different number on it. Rhyme or reason was never a big issue in Hollywood. RKO used five-digit numbers such as 63546, which quickly blows the theory that production numbers represented films-released-in-sequence by a studio.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082238</url></doc>
