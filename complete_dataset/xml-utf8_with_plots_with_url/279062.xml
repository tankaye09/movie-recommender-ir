Edwards, self-proclaimed '"Number 3'" soul man in the world wantsto be 'International Soul Rocker Number One' - equal parts Frank Sinatra and Johnny Rotten, Jon is a self-styled crooner whose real talent lies in his belief in himself rather than in his singing ability. For Jon, fame is anelusive dream and show biz is a lifestyle that's got him by the throat.When Jon learns that his mother is given one month to live, he leaves hisNew York City apartment to take care of her in Los Angeles.
