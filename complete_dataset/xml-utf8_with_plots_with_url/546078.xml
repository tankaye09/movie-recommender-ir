<plot>Every town has its ghost stories, and Brier, Washington is no exception. Four people went into the Brier Woods, and not one of them has been seen again. Three ex-husbands, and the woman they all married, went into the woods for a reconciliation retreat. None of them made it out. One year later, Warren a "John Stosselesk" reporter came to town to uncover the mystery of the four who unexplainably disappeared into the woods. The woman had become known as "The Brier Bitch", and Warren was determined to uncover why, and just what happened, in those woods. Armed with only a video tape and on the edge of uncovering the truth, he was never seen again. Another year after that, Warren's video tape was found, along with his flask. Will this tape uncover the truth? Will it explain what happened to Warren, his cameraman, and the other three men who disappeared, presumably at the hands of "The Brier Bitch"? You'll just have to watch "The Brier Bitch Project" and find out!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546078</url></doc>
