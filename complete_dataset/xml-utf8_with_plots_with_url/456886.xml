<plot>Reagan's Wharf is the story of Lee and Scott, two men who've worked together for years on the local wharf. They now find themselves on opposing sides of the law. Scott, owner of Reagan's Wharf, suffers greatly after his wife's kidnapping. Lee, a failed boat captain, now runs illegal operations on and off the water for the local crime-lord. Both men's troubled past haunts their every move, each willing to go great lengths in restoring order in their lives. When Lee tempts Scott with a clue to his wife's disappearance, they embark seaward on a journey packed with tension, revealing the core of each man's quest for redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?456886</url></doc>
