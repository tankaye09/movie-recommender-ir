<plot>Simon Harvey was a gay man unable to reconcile his gay feelings with his strict christian upbringing. At the age of 26 he killed himself. Simon's father said "To discover my son was gay was as bad as losing him." This film depicts the last six months of his life and examines how religious belief can be used to justify social prejudice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066795</url></doc>
