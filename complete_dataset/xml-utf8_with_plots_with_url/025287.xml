<plot>Ten years after a nuke war between the US and North Korea, we meet Lou our narrator. He and his BFF Mac have been living together since they watched the world end on Lou's little TV in his converted fallout shelter apartment. After the end, Lou and Mac found an abandoned barn in the wasteland and have taken up residence there. Over the years, others have come and gone. Now the group consists of Lou and Mac, along with Butch and Tall. Butch is, as her name suggests, a butch lesbian. She is a total witch to the rest of the group, mostly because in the last two plus years she has been living in the barn the group has not found another living woman. The sexual frustration has built to an unholy level of bitchiness... which makes her a pain to live with, but you should see her kill a zombie. Also living in the barn is Tall, named such because he hasn't said a word in the 9 months since he joined the group... but he sure is tall. More people join the group as the story progresses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025287</url></doc>
