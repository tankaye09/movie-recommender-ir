<plot>Every vote counts on Election Day. When the fate of a country is far too precious to leave to the masses, the secretive and powerful must organize to secure a nation's fate. An unwitting pawn in the game, the front-runner candidate soon learns of this organization's clandestine operation... and his role in it. When this man of conscience flees, the organization must pursue. Plans become clear. Enemies aligned. Allies lost. Trust destroyed. When fate itself is controlled by those who rule, futility is all that's left... and hope is its casualty. The true measure of a man is found in his convictions. When truth is something owned, men can be made. For behind every great man, is a great plan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401878</url></doc>
