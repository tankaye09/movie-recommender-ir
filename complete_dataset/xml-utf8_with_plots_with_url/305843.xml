<plot>Clara, a beautiful American opera singer seeks a fresh start in Rome. She meets Oliver, a disillusioned young English tour-guide, whose frivolous advances are an enticing but ominous breath of fresh air. With a sense of excitement back in her life, the two flirt with irresponsibility until the consequences can no longer be ignored: Clara becomes pregnant. Oliver lacks both strength and desire to face up to their predicament. Alone and flustered Clara rapidly finds her world spiraling out of control, as the reality of her carefree existence comes tragically crashing home. The foreseeable cycle of events are overseen by the understanding Giuseppe, who runs a bar near the Vatican City. His brother, Luca, is an angry and frustrated tour-guide, who ironically feels threatened by foreigners. Both brothers sense the inevitable catastrophe approaching: both are powerless to prevent it. The ephemeral wave of expatriate romances rolls on. As Oliver leaves, another young idealist arrives. Clara is left to struggle with the sweeping delights and ensuing drama that the lifestyle inherently dictates. With Rome as their playground, the characters and events expose the deep composition of the Italian mantra. 'La Bella Figura' is Italy's soul; the essence of appearance over substance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?305843</url></doc>
