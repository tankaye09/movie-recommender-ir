<plot>November 12, the Lindbergh couple alighted in Minho River due to lack of petrol in their single-engine wooden Lockheed Sirius and bad weather conditions, when flying from Geneva to Lisbon. The hydroplane caused an uproar in the small village of Friestas, Portugal. The morning after, they were filmed by a Portuguese film director and cinematographer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337085</url></doc>
