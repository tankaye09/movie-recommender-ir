<plot>In the wake of Ingmar Bergman's death, the Andersonville Theatricals creative team set out to create a brief, silent homage to the legendary filmmaker. The result was Lake of Pain. The distinct interpretations of Lake of Pain may vary, but the key underlying themes are quite universal: the polarities of pain and relief, of acceptance and rejection and perhaps even of life and death. A shirtless man full of anguish and frustration strolls along a beach. There he encounters a figure in a full, dark suit rocking peacefully in a chair. The shirtless man makes several attempts at closeness toward the mysterious one. Their exchanges increase in intensity with some being tender and others violent. Ultimately, it seems, both are appeased.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318337</url></doc>
