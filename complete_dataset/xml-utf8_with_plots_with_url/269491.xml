<plot>A tiny classroom in Spanish heartlands is a meeting point and a shelter for adult immigrants who came to Spain driven by "European dream" to start a new life. Brought together by fate into a small Spanish town, alienated and homesick, these people indulge in playful and enthusiastic language-learning process, trying to establish a dialogue between each other in very particular, delicate circumstances, guided by the extraordinary teacher Maria Antonia. 48 year-old Maria Antonia gets her inspiration from her dreams. She is devoted to her life dream of becoming an actress. It seems sometimes that the classroom transforms to the stage, with Antonia as a leading actress on it. An unusual form of the film brings out an amazing effect - a nostalgic, warm, amusing and cheerful portrait of people who inspired by a charismatic teacher start to believe that whatever happens the most important thing is not to stop dreaming.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269491</url></doc>
