<plot>Unemployed actor Richard Gilbert is ready to become a cab driver in order to earn a living for himself and his young daughter, Toni. His friend, Boris Rascalnikoff persuades a couple of Russian caf√© owners to put up the money to stage Boris' play, "The Road To Siberia", with Richard in the leading role. The play flops and Richard takes the cab-driving job. His girl-friend, Florence Blake, persuades a producer to give Richard the lead in a new play, and Boris is hired as the dance director. The leading lady, Diana Crawford, falls in love with Richard, not knowing he is a widower with a small child. Florence thinks that Richard is in love with Diana and she and Boris devise a plan to show Richard that Diana is a phony. Florence takes Toni to a rehearsal and Diana is so enraged that she walks out on the show, taking the show's backer with her. Boris sells his "The Road To Siberia" title-only to a radio producer, and uses the money to produce the play that was in rehearsal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333513</url></doc>
