<plot>A number of ladies are horrified at the sudden appearance of Hooligan, who in the excitement of taking his annual bath, has forgotten to remove his clothes. As he splashes toward the raft the ladies retreat in haste, and a great crowd of men and boys dash into the water and administer a severe and thorough washing to the unfortunate Hooligan. Beautiful photography and fine water effects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245186</url></doc>
