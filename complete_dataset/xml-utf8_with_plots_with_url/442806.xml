<plot>In this picture we present a wonderful and life-like likeness of President McKinley. He first walks upon the platform, escorting Mrs. McKinley, whom he very reverently shows to a seat. The President is next introduced to the audience by President Milburn, of the Pan-American Exposition, and, amid hand-clapping, cheering and waving of hats, he at once begins his memorable speech. He is close to our camera and we secured an absolutely perfect photograph.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442806</url></doc>
