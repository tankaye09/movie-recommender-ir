<plot>Shanker Choudhury's (Tarun Bose) mother (Pratima Devi), at the pleas of her dying husband, marries off his (Shanker's) daughter to a youth. Both the children are under-age and do not know nor understand that they have been married. When Shanker's wife (Veena) finds out, she is livid, and refuses to let her child be committed to this marriage. Years pass, Shanker has passed away, though his mother is still alive, and his wife is a widow, and his daughter has now grown up to be a lovely young lady, Roopa (Vyjayanthimala). Roopa has many suitors, but she is attracted to only one - Ashok (Uttam Kumar). Ashok is also attracted to her, and both fall in love. Roopa introduces Ashok to her mother, who approves of him, and plans are set to marry them. Then Roopa finds out that she has already been married in child-hood. This creates a conflict in her. Others too find out and all of a sudden Roopa is shunned, avoided, and even asked not to participate in a wedding ceremony. Ashok is supportive and wants to go ahead with marriage with Roopa. How will both oulive this stigma that Roopa is already married, and will the law and the community permit Roopa to be married a second time?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102251</url></doc>
