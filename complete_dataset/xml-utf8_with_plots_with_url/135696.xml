<plot>Over half a million ducks are confined, tortured, and slaughtered in factory farms every year in the United States to produce the gourmet cruelty foie gras. Just two companies are responsible for all of this suffering--Hudson Valley Foie Gras in New York and Sonoma Foie Gras in California. Most people have no idea that these factory farms even exist, much less what goes on inside them. Confined in crowded pens and tiny isolation cages, and force fed three times a day to fatten their livers, these ducks suffer unseen. GourmetCruelty.com takes you behind the closed doors of the entire U.S. foie gras industry, exposing the daily pain and torture inherent to the production of this cruel delicacy. Over the course of its yearlong investigation (2002-2003), GourmetCruelty.com investigators were able to rescue fifteen of these long suffering birds. Delicacy of Despair is the haunting portrait of the tens of thousands of ducks who are left behind and the fifteen who found freedom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135696</url></doc>
