<plot>The coast: place from where human beings leave or arrive, line drawn by the water over the earth, feasible of being represented with elementary slight knowledge of cartography. But, a nomadic coast, summons to drama. It can happens to us, start from a place where we will never be able to find even if we decided, or it becomes necessary, the return. It can happen to us, never arrive to the place where we started off, that floats, without rules, with the tides. A nomadic coast makes the trip a peregrination, a destiny. The nomadic coast is a choral film. Their personages ramble between the walls of a city that ignores and leaves them to their own luck. The matter is the daily life rarefied by desire, dreams, solitude and death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?307600</url></doc>
