<plot>She's sitting on a small bench beneath a tree in a garden; he sits down next to her, sets his walking stick at his feet, tosses away his cigarette, removes his boater, and puts his arms around her. They kiss and cuddle as a thin man appears behind the bench, grinning, and motioning for someone else to come from our left. It's a man, probably her dad, carrying a shovel. Our lover picks up his boater and stick with dad taps him on the shoulder; he rises, and he starts to put up some resistance as dad grabs his daughter's arm. Threatening gestures, kicks, and dad's triumph ensue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267143</url></doc>
