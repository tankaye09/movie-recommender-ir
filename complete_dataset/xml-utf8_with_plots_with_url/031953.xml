<plot>During the summer of 1903 at Atlantic City, N. J., the famous summer resort, there was an Alligator Farm, on which thousands of these huge monsters were bred. We succeeded in obtaining the only moving picture ever taken of a large number in captivity, and it is full of animation. The figures are large. Very interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031953</url></doc>
