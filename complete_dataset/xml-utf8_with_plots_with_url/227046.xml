<plot>A film about the indiscriminate destruction of forest taking place in the foothills of Himalaya, particularly in Bodoland area of Assam(India) and predominantly inhabited by the indigenous Bodo people. Budang - a poor forest dweller earns his daily bread by petty illegal timber supply to nearby township. His daughter Mithingga(nature) is proposed for marriage. But the financial aspect of marriage worries the poor Budang. To enhance his income he acquires a used bicycle and plans to supply more timber. On his first attempt the bicycle is confiscated. Then he adopts another method of timber log smuggling through the river rafting. This time too the logs are confiscated. Finding no alternative he adopts the easier way to earn money by cutting trees and loading them in trucks for the young local timber smugglers, who has good relation with some dishonest forest official and timber merchant from outside. But the same people gang rape Budang's daughter Mithingga.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227046</url></doc>
