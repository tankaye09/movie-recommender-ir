<plot>The first 100 days in office are commonly viewed as the start of every President's legacy. Sadly, the first days of 2009 have been tumultuous ones for America at large. For African Americans, in particular, it has been a record year of lost homes, lost jobs, and the loss of prospects for a prosperous future. As Black America holds its breath in wait for solutions and relief from the man who, just a few short months ago, gave us all the audacity to hope, BET NEWS asks the question on many lips: "What has the first 100 Days meant for us?" Gathering a wide range of voices - from power brokers, to pundits and political players, as well as Administration officials and regular citizens from our live studio audience, and web response portals - this timely one hour takes a sharp look at the Obama Presidency, and what he's been able to accomplish and how it will ultimately affects our lives and our families.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406288</url></doc>
