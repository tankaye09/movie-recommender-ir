<plot>Abigail is a young woman in her twenties who has recently lost her parents and moved to Chicago to share an apartment with her estranged Aunt, to whom she pays rent and rarely speaks. Abigail is troubled by sleeplessness and nocturnal visits from apparitions. When her Aunt suddenly dies, the distinction between reality and dream dissolves. The only person who understands her is Hector, a young man from Colombia with a fatal illness who's lost all hope and just needs a place to stay.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408191</url></doc>
