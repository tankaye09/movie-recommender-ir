<plot>In the future, high-speed hover vehicles zoom across tracks suspended high above cities in the fastest and most dangerous race ever: F-Zero. The F-Zero Grand Prix was cancelled years ago due to the number of people injured in the sport, but has been revived by popular demand. You'll compete in the Jack, Queen, and King cups, each with 6 courses. If you're good enough, you'll even unlock a couple more hidden cups. You can also take a time trial to see how quick you are, enter the Death Race to try and destroy all of your opponents, or even race against up to 3 of your friends! Join Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, and 28 other racing diehards for a super-fast race across the galaxy!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186818</url></doc>
