<plot>Loosely based on the 1957 classic "Dekh Kabira Roya", this is a story of three male friends, Deepak, Vinod and Sanjay. While Sanjay runs a business; Vinod is an ardent cricket fan and player; and Deepak a singer. The three pals meet three young ladies named Neela, Shree, and Sherry, who would like to marry a businessman, a cricketer, and a singer. The dreams of these ladies do come true, and they wind up on a marriage pandal with the love of their lives. But wait, Neela who wanted to marry a cricket player is about to tie the knot with businessman Sanjay; Shree wanted to marry a businessman but ends up with Deepak the singer; and Sherry who wanted to marry a singer ends up with cricketer Vinod. To add to the confusion are gangster Tundabhai, and a Pakistan-based terrorist, Chaman Chindi, who are out to kill Sanjay, Deepak and Vinod, so that Tundabhai can add Neela, Shree and Sherry to his harem - &amp; the result is utter and hilarious chaos.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150203</url></doc>
