<plot>It is things as usual at The Video Lodge this Friday night. Storeowner, Dale Dowdy is at his wits end trying to get his lazy employees, the McIntyre brothers, to do their work. Neglected customers like Haywood Pickens storm from the store with empty hands. Donnie Ray and Ronnie Ray McIntyre never get to restock those shelves thanks to local slacker Randy Cherry. He struts in talking about the most awesome and goriest movie ever, the one he is goin' to make. He explains his plans to make the film with a broken camera and a $200 special e-fects budget. Soon he has the brothers ready to make a movie, that is until the boss reappears.
