<plot>A modified version of the star's earlier show, "The Dunninger Show", after it moved to a new network. Magician Joseph Dunninger, known simply as Dunnigner on stage, earned a reputation in the 1950's as a mentalist and mind-reader of note. In this weekly program, he would invite a new celebrity guest (along with several members of the audience) on stage for each show and let them test him as he put on his unique performance of his supposed psychic powers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?539912</url></doc>
