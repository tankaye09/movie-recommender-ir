<plot>Two up coming comedians to attempt to get sacked on purpose - on their first day at work. Each week the two new recruits are introduced to the existing members of staff in separate companies. The person who gets sacked nearest to 3.00pm, be it before or after, will win. They can't use violence, they can't swear or do anything illegal - and above all, they can't ask to be fired. They must use strategy to ensure they don't go too far, too soon; or leave it too late. Using hidden cameras the contestant's every move is watched. The managers and staff are unaware that they are taking part in a game and this leads to hilarious reactions as they attempt to understand the behavior of the new starters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?588229</url></doc>
