<plot>Timeless torment of people hunted by War, that happened yesterday, today and tomorrow. The story is displaced in the inner personal horror of experiencing War.One life worth a life. Timeless and space less journey trough memories of lost lives. Consequences of wrong acts are the torture of the righteous. The film is questioning the morality of a War Photographer, a woman War victim which becomes a killer when she takes lives to honor life, and passive spectators of events as the future victims. Based on a war story where love doesn't win, but it strikes the absurdity of humanity. The characters are frozen in a moment of time. One moment before dying, this film expands it into a 20minutes, but for the characters the dying stays forever. And a little girl, as a reference to the Future, is saying to the Photographer, after his redemption with his past: "You were too late then, too late now and will be too late tomorrow."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021675</url></doc>
