<plot>Slug McSlug, a notorious bank robber, is chased by police after his latest heist. He reaches his country hideout, where he is promptly visited by an uninvited Daffy Duck, who is a door-to-door vendor of a variety of items. McSlug slams his door in Daffy's face, but Daffy persists in his effort to sell something to McSlug and raises the ire of the wanted criminal. McSlug opens fire on Daffy, who conveniently is wearing a sample of his company's bullet-proof vests. When Daffy turns on the gas of McSlug's stove to demonstrate the igniting power of his sample lighter, McSlug literally throws Daffy out and tries the lighter himself, which blows the hideout and McSlug sky-high.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?594063</url></doc>
