<plot>'Landscapes' evolves around the meeting between a father and his two twin sons which he hasn't seen for the first 21 years of their lives. The three men have agreed to meet in the middle of nowhere and they set out for several days walk in the wilderness with their backpacks loaded with their personal expectations. These expectations are soon to bee shattered by reality as they get to know each other. The conflict between the father and his two sons escalates while we witness how they try to compensate for the lost years by doing things that a father and his sons normally would do together such as flying with kites, sleeping together in tent and competing in various contests.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318951</url></doc>
