<plot>A dark, twisted, yet sometimes humorous look inside the mind of Curtis Slade as he is driven to homicide and eventual suicide by his Girlfriend. Lost Thoughts begins in the middle of Curtis' story as he tells us how the woman in his life literally drove him away. Curtis ends up having an accident in the middle of nowhere. Thinking he hit a deer, he learns it is another man. Not knowing what to do, Curtis searches for clues and imagines this man to have shared the same thoughts of homicide and suicide. He takes it upon himself to give this stranger a proper burial. After sobering up the next morning, Curtis attempts to live with his decisions and returns home to reconstruct his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343679</url></doc>
