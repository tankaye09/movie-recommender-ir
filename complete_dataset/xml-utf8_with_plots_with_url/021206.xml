<plot>Deepak comes from an upper middle-class family, studies in college, and woos fellow collegian, Rita, who is also in love with him. It is time for College Students' Association Elections, and there is hectic activity within the campus, which is complicated by the active involvement of outside, quite violent elements, who are not students. In this virulent atmosphere, another student, Jaya, is molested by a student named Rakesh. Deepak, Danny (who is Jaya's boyfriend), and Mukesh come to her rescue, and Rakesh gets killed. The elections are postponed, and the trio are on the run from the police - who have launched a manhunt for them. The College Principal announces fresh elections, and with no one to challenge outside elements, it looks like the campus will be taken over by political parties - who may have a vested interest in canvasing the future vote in India's elections - leading to even more chaos and instability.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021206</url></doc>
