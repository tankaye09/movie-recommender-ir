<plot>A policeman on the beat is having a chat with the cook while she is making bread. While thus pleasantly engaged he is warned that his Captain is coming down the street. The policeman hastily puts on his coat and starts off, but as he leaves the cook affectionately embraces him, leaving a very apparent impression of her floury hands on the back of his coat. The scene then changes to the street, where the policeman meets his Captain. He discovers the telltale marks and marches him off to headquarters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248373</url></doc>
