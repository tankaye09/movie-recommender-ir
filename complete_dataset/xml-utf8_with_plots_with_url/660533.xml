<plot>"Woodshop" is a comedic Drama about Chris Johnson realizing it is better to find peoples' strengths in the here and now than keeping to himself in the hopes that things will simply get better for him when he moves on to the next stage of his life. Aside from being his class Valedictorian, Chris is a seemingly un-extraordinary High School Senior. He is determined to "Just get through" his senior year and into an Ivy League School where he hopes to find his peers. However, his plans go a little awry when he misreads his lab partner's Chemistry notes. Chris inadvertently turns an Organic Chemistry test tube into a miniature cruise missile that nearly kills his teacher when it explodes against the black board he is writing on. Having never received anything less than an "A" in school, Chris finds himself with an "F" that could effectively knock him out of Ivy League contention thus "Ruining his future". Sympathetic, Chris' Principal makes him a deal he cannot refuse: If Chris attends a Saturday Vocational Detention in the Woodshop, the "F" will be stricken from his record. Having never so much as touched a hammer he will be awkwardly out of his element; Chris has no choice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660533</url></doc>
