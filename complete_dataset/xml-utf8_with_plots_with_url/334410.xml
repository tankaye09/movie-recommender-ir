<plot>A fictional documentary which takes existing, traditional beliefs about demonic possession and adds a twist. Using imagery and documentary-style voice overs, the film's fictional concept centers on negative emotions as actual living demons which exist in every human being. The film alleges that people are already possessed by demons that come in the form of their negative emotions and moods, and that demons are resident entities in people that are triggered by other negative energies from haunted places, objects, people, and even prayer or invocation of an unseen being.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?334410</url></doc>
