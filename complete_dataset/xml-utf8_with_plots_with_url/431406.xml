<plot>Dutta babu is standing for elections against a cunning, corrupt, &amp; established gangster, Bishamber Prasad, who is also powerful and influential enough to swing the election his way, as well as have Dutta killed. Inspector Ranjit Singh gets evidence about Bishamber's involvement in Dutta's death, but his superior officer, DSP Ravi Khanna, prevents him from taking any action. Ranjit then meets with beautiful Namrata, and both get married. As Ranjit continues to be a thorn on Bishamber's side, he is killed, leaving behind a sorrowing Namrata and two children.
