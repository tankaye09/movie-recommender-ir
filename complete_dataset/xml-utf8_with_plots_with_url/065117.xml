<plot>Anwar lives with his brother, Nawab, the Nawab's wife, and their child, in a wealthy upper class neighborhood. Anwar is in love with Shahida, and would like to marry her. The Nawab has a mistress named Benazir, who he goes to see on a regular basis. Shauket, a friend of the family, tells Nawab that Anwar is also seeing Benazir whenever the Nawab is not around. Nawab is shocked at this, but he witnesses Benazir herself in Anwar's arms, and is enraged. The question remains, if Anwar is in love with Shahida, why he is having an affair with his brother's mistress?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065117</url></doc>
