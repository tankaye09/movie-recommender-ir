<plot>A giant turtle floats through space and reads its book. He meets Adam and Eve, who take over the book and rip the still empty pages from it. But by doing so they set free all unwritten ideas from which objects begin to grow and fill the world of Adam and Eve. When eventually these objects take over their world, Adam and Eve escape. They will end where they started, meeting a giant turtle who shuts his book. It is a film about technological development and man's control or loss of control over it. It is about man's wish for more, faster, better and newer and about losing control over an ever - and fast changing world filled with ideas, plans and inventions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?181432</url></doc>
