<plot>Following the death of his long time terminally ill mother, Ashley, enthusiastically aided and abetted by his sister-in-law, Colette, decides that he needs a wife if only for something to do with his big, now empty house. However, the task of finding a wife turns out to be not as easy as it seems, as Ashley has not had much contact with women in recent years and then there is always the delicate problem of the dull, safe, ever present Gillian to be solved. She and her mother have already settled the question of a wife for Ashley if only Gillian would do something about it!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509316</url></doc>
