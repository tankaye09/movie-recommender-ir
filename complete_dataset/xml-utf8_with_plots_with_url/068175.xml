<plot>Sultan is the Chief of Mujahd-E-Kashmir Front, and he deputes dreaded terrorist Mohammed Jalaudin Ghaznavi to abduct tourists in Mahabaleshwar and hold them for ransom. This ploy fails due to the timely action of Major Abdul Hamid of the National Security Guard, who not only saves the hostages, but also apprehends Ghaznavi. While being held in a cell, Ghaznavi attempts to negotiate his release with Home Minister Mahendra Suryavanshi to no avail. His comrades, led by Shabbir Khan and Aslam Marzban, abduct Suryavanshi's wife, Rukmani, who is the Principal of St. Mark's Sr. Secondary School, along with her son, Chaitanya; his girlfriend, Sapna, and a bus-load of students. Their demands are to ensure to release of Ghaznavi and others as well as free Kashmir from India. Abdul is once again deputed to deal with Shabbir, but ends up becoming their captive. Now the onus is on the Government of India to either accede to the demands of the terrorists or watch as they kill the hostages one by one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068175</url></doc>
