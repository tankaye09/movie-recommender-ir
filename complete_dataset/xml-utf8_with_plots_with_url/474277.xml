<plot>Shobha Rana and her husband have been married for more than 15 years, are childless, and lead a very wealthy life-style. They spend most of their time helping people in need, and praying to Gods of all religion for a child. Their prayers are answered and Shobha gives birth to a baby girl who they name Neelu. She who grows up to be like her parents, never a tear in her eye, always helping the poor and the needy, albeit a little tomboyish, falls in love with her childhood sweetheart, Shekar, the adopted son of Juman, the Mali (Gardener). Rana is not pleased with this alliance, but Shobha convinces him, and he arranges their marriage. On the day of the marriage, Neelu collapses with intense pain in her forehead. She is diagnosed with a tumor in her eye, which is malignant, &amp; cannot be operated upon. Dr. Dharamveer asks them to pray so that Neelu can pass away without much pain. The question remains as to how can parents perform such a drastic prayer - the death of their only child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474277</url></doc>
