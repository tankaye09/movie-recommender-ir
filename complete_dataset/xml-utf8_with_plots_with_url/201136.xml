<plot>A couple finishes their meal at Yan's Kitchen (Hunan cuisine). It's their first date, and they've had a great time. The restaurant owner brings the bill and two fortune cookies. She reads hers: it's a detailed warning about the man she's with - he's wanted by the law and his ex-wives are missing. Her mood changes abruptly. He reads his, and it's a damning expose of her debts, therapeutic needs, and other flaws. They can't wait to be rid of each other. But, as he pays the bill, the man asks the owner where he gets the cookies; the owner points to a woman working in the restaurant's kitchen. Should our couple believe all that they read or should they chance it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201136</url></doc>
