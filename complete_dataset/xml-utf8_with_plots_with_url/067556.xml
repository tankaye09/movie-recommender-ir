<plot>A series of three panelists - among who include astrologers, a palmist, a handwriting expert, and clairvoyants - question a mystery guest. Each panelist has to his/her disposal only the tools of his/her trade: the astrologers have an astrological chart of the guest, the handwriting expert a sample of the guest's handwriting, the palmist a print of the guest's palm, and the clairvoyants a personal object belonging to the guest. Each panelist is given a set amount of time to make as many statements as he/she can about the guest, getting one point for every correct statement and bonus points for guessing the identity of the guest. After questioning the two guests per episode, the panelist with the most points wins the contest for that episode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067556</url></doc>
