<plot>Modern Daydreams is a suite of four Chaplinesque films exploring the theme of movement engendered by day-to-day life. They are post-modern comedies with silent film sensibilities revealing much of the movement about us to be metaphors for both romance and isolation. "Treadmill Softly" - A man reaches aerobic heart rate at the gym when he falls for a hunkette. "Islands in the Sky" - Four people weave fifty feet in the air atop four cherry-pickers, aloft and aloof in their ivory towers. "Unleashed" - A cubicle-bound Dilbert-ditto gets in touch with his inner puppy. "Deere John" - A man and a twenty-two ton John Deere excavator dance a dance of discovery, fulfillment, and eventually, the loss that any diesel-based relationship must suffer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374013</url></doc>
