<plot>Divertissement is the story of five amateur dancers who began the study of classical ballet later in life and how their lives were transformed through dance. Each of these women are non-professional dancers with lives, careers and families outside the studio, yet each is drawn by the desire to fulfill something long set aside: the dream of dance. Coming from all walks of life, they confront obstacles of ageism, physical and self-esteem issues and emotional challenges as they embark on their journey. How they persevere and how their lives change is as touching as it is empowering.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152411</url></doc>
