<plot>The origin of the Universe and Man's role are told in this long-form musical feature which melds cosmology, philosophy and theism into a grand-unified-theory of all questions yet to be answered. Parkinson's screenplay eschews dialogue entirely, choosing instead to communicate the film's universal plot and complex ideas through visuals, actors and music only.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032684</url></doc>
