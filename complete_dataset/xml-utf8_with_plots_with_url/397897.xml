<plot>This show is just as the title tells. Teenagers and children playing adults. They have everyday problems and deal with them just as if they were adults, and in this show they are. From missing your daughters dance competition to being late for work or paying taxes. This show has it all, humour and a touch of realism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?397897</url></doc>
