<plot>Chronicled through his journal, William Bryne, an idealistic, God-fearing young man, volunteers for war for the noblest of reasons; Duty, God, and Country. The deaths of the platoon's officers and a sergeant's suicide have pressed Corporal Bryne into command. Then comes word of the improbable, William must lead his beleaguered and outnumbered men into battle. William struggles to maintain his faith and understand his place between good and evil, while his tank crew comes to grips with their impending fate. After saving a Korean soldier's life and quelling a desertion and mutiny, William musters his last shred of idealism and leads his men into battle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558815</url></doc>
