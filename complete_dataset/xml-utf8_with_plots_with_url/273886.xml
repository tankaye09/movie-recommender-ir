<plot>Singer/songwriter Jann Arden packs her bags and heads for the Big Apple in search of her one elusive goal - American recognition - in the all-new, one-hour "rock-umentary" Jann Takes Manhattan. This special follows an intrepid Arden as she travels to New York for two weeks to perform in an Off-Broadway theatre with the ambition of finding a U.S. agent and attracting media attention. "I am tossing the proverbial pebble in the pond of one of the biggest music markets in the world," says Arden. "The idea being, 'if you make it there, you'll make it anywhere.'" The camera captures the magic of Arden's musical performances in an intimate setting upstairs at the legendary Studio 54. In between performance footage, viewers see Arden and her band take in the Big Apple, visiting CBS Sunday Morning, 95.5 WPLJ FM, and busking in Central Park. The question remains: will Jann's New York jaunt be enough to finally propel her star across the border?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273886</url></doc>
