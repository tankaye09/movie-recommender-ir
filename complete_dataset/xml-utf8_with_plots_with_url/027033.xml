<plot>Mixing present day interview with dramatic reconstruction, this programme looks at the lives of those who came to the Scottish mainland to work in domestic service in the 1940s. Out of their comfort zone, in a world where their native language wasn't spoken, these ladies worked long and hard in their masters' beautiful homes, cooking, cleaning, and looking after the children. In between, they tried to have some fun too.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027033</url></doc>
