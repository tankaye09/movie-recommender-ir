<plot>An asteroid of immense proportions is on a collision course with mother Earth. The planet rallies behind Project Gauntlet, a worldwide effort to send 500 spacecraft along the asteroid's inbound path. A focused nuclear device equips each spacecraft and is aimed at the incoming asteroid. The plan is to gradually nudge the object into a different orbit that will save Earth. Only a small group of scientists and engineers know the truth, that changing the orbit is impossible, however to an unsuspecting and naive public they embrace the Project to save themselves and their planet. Unsuspecting children are recruited ranging from ages ten to sixteen and are trained to man the spacecraft and become the Flight Crew. Each spacecraft is launched on a thousand year journey from a rail gun parked in lunar orbit. Each spends ten years accelerating to near light speed. The young Flight Crew are tucked away in personal hypersleep 'cocoons' designed to open when near their destination. Once revived, the Flight Crew discovers they're awakened seventy five years too soon. The young children suffer from the major side effect of hypersleep - persistent and unpredictable amnesia which becomes a source of endless conflict and problems between them. They are beset with social, psychological problems, and must overcome severe mechanical problems with their spacecraft. The children struggle to make a life in a world far from home, away from their parents and their comfortable and supportive environment. They come to realize that no real home for them will ever exist again and must deal with problems normally associated with adults twice their age. This is a story of hope, dreams and lost innocence, as the children overcome their fears while they journey to maintain the human race and save themselves. Thus begins the saga of Flight Crew #317, their ship, and its journey.</plot><plot>An asteroid of immense proportions is on a collision course with mother Earth.
