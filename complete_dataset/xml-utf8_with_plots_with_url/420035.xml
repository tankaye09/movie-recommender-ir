<plot>A couple has decided to commit suicide together. When they both take a poisonous pill to die, she accidentally drops it where it can't be found. But he has a backup-plan: A gun. Only two bullets. They get wasted. Now, pandemonium ensues as their being together in death forever seems to be spoiled. Frantically, she tries to kill herself, before he (who swallowed the pill in the beginning) dies alone, without her being with him. But how?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420035</url></doc>
