<plot>This was "Community Sing" number 10 of the 1946-47 production season (Columbia production number 8660) with Don Baker pumping away at the organ while the Song Spinners sung the songs, and the bouncing ball implored the audience to sing along. This one leads off with "Managua, Nicaragua", a swingy novelty tune that spent 14 weeks on the Lucky Strike Hit Parade from February 15 through May 17, 1947. Audiences seldom joined in, and were less inclined to do so on a song with a title they couldn't pronounce. The remaining songs were "Why Did I Ever Leave Wyoming", "Here and Now", "Bless You for Being an Angel" and "Over the Rainbow."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112612</url></doc>
