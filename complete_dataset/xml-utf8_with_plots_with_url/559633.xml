<plot>Jonathan Rendall's broke, he's been given Â£12,000 to gamble with, and he gets to keep any winnings. He'll bet on anything: from racing to roulette, boxing to blackjack. All he needs is luck. This is a gambling spree that takes him around the world and finishes up in Las Vegas. If he plays his cards right, it's a trip that could set him up for life. But he's got more than the odds against him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559633</url></doc>
