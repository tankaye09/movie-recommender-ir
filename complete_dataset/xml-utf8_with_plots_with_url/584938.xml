<plot>Four Black women, profane and brassy, bring stand-up to Memphis's Orpheum Theatre. Miss Laura Hayes opens the show and serves as MC. She tells family stories about grandkids, her mom, and her sisters. Adele Givens urges her audience to celebrate their flaws; she comments on this crazy world, her 92-year-old grandmother, and the need to take care when naming a baby. Sommore, recently released from jail, talks about kids, men, marriage, and why moms give their eight-year-old daughters a hula-hoop. Last, Mo'Nique celebrates big women, contrasts Blacks and Whites, and gives advice about sex. The film also cuts away to footage of the Queens on the town having fun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584938</url></doc>
