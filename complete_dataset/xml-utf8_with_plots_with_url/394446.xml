<plot>"An excellent view of 'The Finest,' on their annual parade and inspection, June 1, 1899. The head of the column is just turning into 14th street from Broadway, the Morton House forming part of the background. Crowds line both sides of the cable car tracks, falling back as the band heading the first division swings around Dead Man's Curve, and passes the camera. Chief Devery makes a fine showing; as also do his men, with their white gloves and helmets, shining buttons and spick and span appearance in general."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394446</url></doc>
