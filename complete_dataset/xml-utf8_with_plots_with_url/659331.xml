<plot>"Witt's Daughter" is a timeless tale of expectations vs. reality. When stiff-necked Army Lieutenant, Witt Stringfield returns from the Korean War with the picture in his mind of home as he left it three years before- he gets a rude awakening. His three-year-old daughter, Catherine May, treats him as an unwelcome stranger. Witt's left alone with her on his first night home, and the young father who's used to commanding situations, butts heads with his adorable little girl as he attempts to force her to love him. How he wins his last skirmish of the Korean War makes for a compelling and thoughtful story in this sweet tale of love, expectations and how the simplest act can bond two hearts for a lifetime.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659331</url></doc>
