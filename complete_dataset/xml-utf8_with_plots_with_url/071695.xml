<plot>Birdon is a depressed bird, who has been locked away in a cage for quite some time now. He seems ultimately bored as he has a very depressing look on his face. The only thing that really interests him, is the sky. He made a painting of it. One day Birdon can't take it anymore and out of frustration he starts pulling on the bars of his cage. It's a miracle! The door slams open and Birdon nearly falls out of it. He seems afraid of freedom at first, but then he gets a hold of himself and takes a flight through the skies. Nothing can stop Birdon's wings to take him anywhere he wants now, so it seems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071695</url></doc>
