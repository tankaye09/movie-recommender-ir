<plot>In a mythical Japan, Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, has been appointed Lord High Executioner and must find someone to execute before the arrival of the ruling Mikado. He lights upon Nanki-Puh, a strolling minstrel who loves the beautiful Yam-Yam. But Yam-Yam is also loved by Ko-Ko, and Nanki-Puh, seeing no hope for his love, considers suicide. Ko-Ko offers to solve both their problems by executing Nanki-Puh, and an agreement is reached whereby Ko-Ko will allow Nanki-Puh to marry Yam-Yam for one month, at the end of which Nanki-Puh will be executed, in time for the arrival of the Mikado. But what Ko-Ko doesn't know is that Nanki-Puh is the son of the Mikado and has run away to avoid a betrothal to an old harridan named Katischa. The arrival of the Mikado brings all the threads of the tale together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?138732</url></doc>
