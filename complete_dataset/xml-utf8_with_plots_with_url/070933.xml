<plot>A poor but brilliant young UCLA law student is caught up in an insider trading scam that goes south. Unconnected, he takes the fall for his wealthier fellow students and is incarcerated at a dangerous, high-security prison. Despite two years of violence there, during which his life is saved by a cell-mate named Darryl Orton, he finishes his degree by correspondence, setting an academic record. He wins nationwide attention as "the poster boy for second chances" and a "hero of the new penology" and wins an early release. He has his pick of publicity-hungry top law firms, and selects a San Francisco firm that represents Synoptics, the company at which a female executive was allegedly murdered by Darryl, to whom he owes his life. Billy believes Darryl to be innocent and vows when he gets outside to win him a new trial and an acquittal. He cleverly manages to get on the Synopics legal team and, working from the inside, begins to unravel the truth, a truth that leads to the highest echelons of industry, and perhaps even to the leaders of his own law firm. But people who help him are getting killed and he, the pursuer, becomes the pursued. Hard life-and-death choices face him, but at the end, only a beautiful fellow associate he has come to love can save Billy and his client--but it will cost her everything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070933</url></doc>
