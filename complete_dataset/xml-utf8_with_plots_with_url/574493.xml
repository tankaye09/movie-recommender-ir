<plot>Young and athletic John Peabody is sick of city life and visits his uncle's lumber camp and is put to work, although his uncle will not recognize him as a nephew. But after John wins a lumber-sawing contest and subdues a drunken brawl among the lumberjacks, his uncle, "Wolf" John, is pleased and announces him as his nephew and as a future partner. John falls in love with with Belle, and adopted daughter of his uncle. Another lumberjack, "Bull" Bart is also in love with her. "Bull" quits and goes to work for a rival company where he plans to sabotage John's work on the big King Pines job, which would forfeit "Wolf" John's rights to the timber. However, all of "Bull's" efforts are for nothing, and he challenges John to a gunfight duel in the street.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574493</url></doc>
