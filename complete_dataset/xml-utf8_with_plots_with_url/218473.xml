Not for increased success or popularity but for family, for home. His wish is granted. School is out for the semester and Chris is going Home. Never one to stray to the path, Chris veers. Whether it is basking in the company of a gorgeous girl, playing like a child or simply laughing at life's funny moments, Chris makes sure his journey home is an entertaining one. Unfortunately for Chris, he is about to learn life's most important lesson -life isn't fair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218473</url></doc>
