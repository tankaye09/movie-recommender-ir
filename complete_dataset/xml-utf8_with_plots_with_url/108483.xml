<plot>A fleeting reunion between an estranged father and his son, raggedly and impolitely thrown together at a hotel looking out on Sydney International Airport. Dad - a struggling entrepreneur - is rerouted from Papua New Guinea to Wellington via Sydney, and while there he reckons he's "got to see" his boy. And so they come together for a few stolen moments - acutely aware that their reunion will end as soon as it's begun. They go through their rituals, make small talk, listen and don't hear, miss each other and occasionally connect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108483</url></doc>
