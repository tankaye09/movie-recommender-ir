<plot>After a troubled year in school, Jodi is informed by her teacher, Ms. Hemp, that she will recommend to Jodi's father that the girl be sent to a special boarding school next year. Horrified at the thought of being separated from her beloved father, Jodi does what any young child in the same situation would do: she sneaks into the school the next day when nobody is there but Ms. Hemp is there and brutally murders her by crushing her with a bookcase so Ms. Hemp can't meet with her father. Well, maybe Jodi isn't like the other children. As other people start to come between the girl and her father, they also meet similar fates.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123961</url></doc>
