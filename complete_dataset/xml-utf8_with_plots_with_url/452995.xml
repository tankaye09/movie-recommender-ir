<plot>This picture was taken on First street, Dawson City. Temperature forty-five degrees below zero. During the long winter months in Dawson City the miners get up races and offer prizes of large sums of money. This is a typical scene. First comes the bicycle, followed closely by the dog teams and the cutter. An exciting race. Gives a good view of the main street of Dawson in winter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452995</url></doc>
