<plot>Mr. Heisen-Bear and Al-Bear Einstein, two animated bears, work together to solve Heisen-Bear's every day problems using the scientific method and other science concepts. The videos start by explaining a problem that Mr. Heisen-Bear is having, after which he generalizes the concept, then performs an experiment. He then calls his scientist friend Al-Bear Einstein, to explain the concepts that outline the experiment. In this story, Mr. Heisen-Bear needs to make some fizzy soda for a picnic he's going to with his friends. Through an experiment shown in cartoon as well as by real students in a classroom, the children are taught the scientific method, atoms, acid base reactions, chemical formulas, dilution, solubility, volume, and weight in a manner which they can comprehend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481455</url></doc>
