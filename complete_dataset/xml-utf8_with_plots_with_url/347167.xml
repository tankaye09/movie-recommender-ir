She realizes her love for her violin and music may not fulfill her for the rest of her life. She needs more. But what? She travels to China in hopes of adopting a young girl orphan that will give her a new purpose in life. However, the cultural and language barriers offer challenges harder than expected. Doubtful question arise in her head - is this the right choice? Can she really do this? How will it ever work? Is she ready to be a mother? But all her fears melt away when her old love helps her forge a new love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?347167</url></doc>
