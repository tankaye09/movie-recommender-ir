<plot>Desperate to earn money to support his extended family, Mohan becomes entangled in a web of deceit when he tells a lie in order to obtain a secretarial job in the city with the wealthy Mr Rai. He says he isn't married. But he is. Mr Rai has a daughter with a heart condition. She's confined to a wheelchair but Mohan has more than a mild therapeutic effect on her and she is soon up and running - running after him. Meanwhile, back in the village, the money he has been sending home is being filched by his greedy sister. Soon, mother, wife and a flock of children come looking for him and Mohan finds himself leading a double life in an increasingly desperate effort to avoid all parties learning the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275135</url></doc>
