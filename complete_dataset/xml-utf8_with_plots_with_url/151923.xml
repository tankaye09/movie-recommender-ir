<plot>Nick and Jen Sarbos, traveling cross country for inspiration, stop at a country barn sale and discover they have become part of a story as strange as any of the macabre novels Nick has written. As time unites within the reality of the strange barn, they discover others that have been there longer. Unable to leave, and unwilling to accept the demands of this new reality, Nick soon feels threatened not just by the 'ruint' creatures that pursue them, or even the proprietor that insists he needs something from Nick, but by those in his party, whose survival may depend on his actions. The dis incarnate demon spirit, using the failed experiments of his long past (ruints) and others unwittingly caught in his snare, exerts mounting pressure on Mr. Sarbos to participate in his final liberation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151923</url></doc>
