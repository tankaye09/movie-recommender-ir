<plot>Viktor, a pathological liar, confesses to his psychiatrist that he just killed his wife because she was unfaithful. However, the circumstances are unknown even to Viktor, who seems to be blocking every memory of what really happened that night. The psychiatrist bluntly questions Viktor about his reasons and forces pieces of the painful truth out of him. As the confession continues, Viktor starts recalling everything: his paranoia, pain, the lies his wife told him, and finally an image of her dead body lying in bed with a bullet in her head. This last image triggers a memory in his mind, and shortly afterward, everything starts to piece together. As the truth slowly dawns on him Viktor realizes he has committed an even more atrocious crime, a crime for which he will have to repent for the rest of eternity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?487791</url></doc>
