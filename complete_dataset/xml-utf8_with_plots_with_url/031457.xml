<plot>The classic comic strip, "Dennis the Menace," was created by Hank Ketcham. The strip's central character was Dennis Mitchell, a young elementary school-aged lad who always seemed to get into trouble. Dennis' escapades caused no end of grief for his ever-suffering neighbor, George Wilson, who was constantly frustrated by his blonde-haired neighbor's well-meaning ways and frequent visits enjoy peace and quiet. Mr. Wilson's wife, Martha, adored Dennis. However, Mr. Wilson's wife, Martha, adored Dennis. Stories centered on Dennis' adventures with his friends, among which included Joey and Margaret; his faithful canine companion, Ruff; and the oftentimes less-than-willing Mr. Wilson. Several adventures also involved criminals, who were often begging to be arrested once Dennis got through with them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031457</url></doc>
