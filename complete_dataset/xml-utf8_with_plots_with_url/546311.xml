<plot>This is in every respect one of the most interesting horse race pictures ever made. Our photographers had the advantage of a clear day, and the race was one of the greatest ever run in the United States. Having had four cameras at the track, we were able to secure: 1st, A view of the horses leaving the paddock and the parade to the post. Second scene shows the horses lined up before the barrier and the efforts of the starter to get the high-strung animals in line for a fair start; this scene ends with the start proper. The next scene shows the pack coming down the stretch on the first time by, well bunched and racing at tremendous speed. Next scene shows all the horses on backstretch, with Hermis and Irish Lad, the two favorites, racing ahead like a team. The next scene shows the horses rounding the turn on the homestretch, with "The Picket" creeping up on the inside. Then the finish comes, with "The Picket" winning by a neck. A close view is then given of "The Picket" in the hands of the rubbers. Throughout the different scenes a very good view is given of the enormous crowd which throng the track for this, the first, and probably the greatest race of the season.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546311</url></doc>
