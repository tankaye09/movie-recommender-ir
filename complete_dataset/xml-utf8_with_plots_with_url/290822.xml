<plot>Kicked Out gives slackers a challenge:grow up already! And there's no running to Mom and Dad,because they're in on the conspiracy.In fact,they can't wait to get started... Take a slacker who lives at home and does,well,nothing. No job.No prospects.No chores.No more! Enough is enough and he or she is getting kicked out. For real. The slacker will have to earn a living,pay rent,do their own laundry,live on a budget,make their bed and lie in it.Think again. The slackers,or"twixters"(twenty-something's who refuse to grow up),will have to take on more responsibility than they ever had to,thanks to specific challenges designed just for them by their parents. Can the overgrown kids handle ten days of reality? Will they ever change their ways or slump back into slackerdom?And what till the experiment do to family relations The results will suprise you but it's the slackers who are in for the shock of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290822</url></doc>
