<plot>Dev Dutt lives in a small town in Bihar, India, with his mom, and older brother, Jwala. It is his dream that he become a doctor, and the family makes many sacrifices to make his dream come true. Jwala himself forfeits any education, and a better life, so that he can save enough money to send Dev to medical college. They succeed in accumulating enough to send him to medical college in Bombay, where through hard work and diligence he succeeds in becoming a doctor. Since he is aware of an acute shortage of doctors and medical personnel in Bihar, he decides to return home and start a small practice with his mom and Jwala's blessings. When he returns home, he finds that everything has changed. His mother lives a near-destitute life, and Jwala has now become a dacoit - on the run from the police for multiple murders and robberies - and who is wanted dead or alive for rupees one lakh fifty thousand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282966</url></doc>
