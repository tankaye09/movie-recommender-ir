<plot>Undercover cop Danny Vega has been working in the dark for 5 years trying to gain the trust of ice-cold ring leader Rafael "El Chino" Rodriguez, whom he has become fond of but not knowing that Rodriguez is fully aware of Vega's true identity. Det. Jeff Dougherty (Vega's boss, who's file isn't particularly clean) is been pushed by Rodriguez enemies to get him off the streets in 12 hours using Vega as an unlikely hired gun. I.A. Lt. Wasserman has a case against Vega about running a protection money collection scheme while he was an uniformed cop. Wasserman - who works for Rodriguez - uses it in order to push Vega to deliver Dougherty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118935</url></doc>
