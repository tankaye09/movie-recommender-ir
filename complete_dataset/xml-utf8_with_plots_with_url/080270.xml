<plot>"Positively the most realistic and exciting fire run ever offered to exhibitors. It shows the entire horseless fire department of Boston, accompanied by the old style apparatus which is run by horses running at terrific pace down Batterymarch Street, Boston, on its way to a fire. There are four horseless engines, and the black smoke rolls from the smokestakes in great volumes. Another view on this same film shows a portion of the Boston fire department making a quick hitch in the engine-house and running out with the horses on a gallop."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080270</url></doc>
