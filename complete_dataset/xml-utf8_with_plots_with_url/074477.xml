<plot>When the announcement was made to move the Cleveland Browns in 1995, football fans worldwide were stunned and outraged. Through avid dedication and unprecedented support, these enthusiasts helped return the Browns to Cleveland in 1999. Though the team has had disappointing seasons and have yet to make the Super Bowl, the fans continually retain a high level of devotion. Their affection has earned them an infamous reputation, making "The Dawg Pound" a household name and The Cleveland Browns Backers the largest organization of fans in the world. Bleeding Orange and Brown: A Cleveland Tradition is a two-year project capturing the phenomenon of the Cleveland Browns fans across the nation and abroad. This feature details the 2004 season, from Draft Day to the season finale. The fans themselves tell the story of their city and team. Candid and engaging narratives serve as a window into the world of football fandom and perhaps more importantly, the culture of Northeastern Ohio.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074477</url></doc>
