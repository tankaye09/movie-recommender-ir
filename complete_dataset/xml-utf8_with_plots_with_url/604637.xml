<plot>On a stormy night, young woman asks another guest at party to rescue her from her lecherous boss and take her to the train station. When her rescuer suggests that she stop at his place to get out of her wet clothes, she dashes from his car. The door she knocks on for help is the home of a retired actor and there she spends the rest of the night. He makes no passes and next morning she discovers young man who drove her from party is next door neighbor. The two men compete for her affections. Older man's zany live-in house-keeper and a seagull she has rescued provide comic relief.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604637</url></doc>
