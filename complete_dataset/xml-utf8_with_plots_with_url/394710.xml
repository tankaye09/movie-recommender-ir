<plot>Mr. Green is a composer; his next door neighbor has a headache and is trying to sleep. They share a telephone; Mr. Green's publisher keeps calling on it, which means he has to keep disturbing his neighbor. That, combined with the noise their wives keep making, leads to a rising level of anger and violence, to comic effect. To top it all off, their landlord is trying to repair a picket fence, but everyone keeps walking on it and breaking it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394710</url></doc>
