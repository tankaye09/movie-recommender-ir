<plot>Four friends from Boston spend a weekend in a cabin in Northern New Hampshire when they are suddenly trapped by a snow storm. Before they can even settle in the door comes crashing in. There on the floor lays a man, half dead from being unprotected from the harsh outdoors. Panicked, he cries out, "I have to warn you! Someone knows!" Unable to say more he loses consciousness. We are left to wonder, who was he there to warn and what about? Everyone has secrets. Cary, Jim, Sarah, and Mary each have something appalling they've kept secret for years from everyone. Who is in Danger? Who is dangerous? Most importantly, who will kill to keep their secret from getting out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089949</url></doc>
