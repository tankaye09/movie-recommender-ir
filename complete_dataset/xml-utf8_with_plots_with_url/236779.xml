<plot>In the southwestern region of the Canadian province of Ontario, few were more important in its history than the British settlement's founder, Thomas Talbot. In this film, we follow his early military career with the future Duke of Wellington until he was assigned to the British colonies in the future Ontario. There he met the love of his life, Susanne Johnson, but her mixed Native American heritage keeps them apart by her own volition. From there, we follow his civilian career as the landholder of a major settlement in Ontario that would grown to be one of the major communities in the colony. Yet, he faces conflicts with his settlers that would come to a head in the rebellions of 1837 where his statesmenship would be put to the ultimate test.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236779</url></doc>
