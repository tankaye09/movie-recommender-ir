<plot>What do change and the future have in common? How does your organization accept change. The truth is, leading companies accept change more readily, and actually make it work for them. That's what makes the two parts of our All Change program so compelling. First, we travel into the future with John Cleese as H.G. Wells. In Part 1: Change For The Better, Wells shows the dire consequences for businesses that don't move ahead with the times. Next, we learn how to avoid those pitfalls in Part 2: The Shape Of Things To Come. It's a look at the necessary resources we need to ensure communication, training, and support for the future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030602</url></doc>
