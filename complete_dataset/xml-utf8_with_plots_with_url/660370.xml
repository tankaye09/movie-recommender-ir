<plot>This is truly wonderful and proves that there is still a chance for all old bald heads. A man enters the parlors of a tonsorial artist and requests him to examine a bald pate to discover if there are any roots left. The barber fails to find any but recommends his Hair Restorer which he proceeds to apply to the shining head. Immediately after he makes the second application hair appears on the head in spots and continues to grow until the growth reaches to the shoulders of the patient. This is exceedingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660370</url></doc>
