<plot>Here is shown the brave crew of the Cruiser Raleigh marching in review at the unveiling of General Grant's monument at Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. Everyone is interested in the men who so ably fought the Spaniards at Manila, directly over their mines in the harbor, and under the guns of their forts. They are a brave looking set of men, and this film shows the men just as they appeared.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118559</url></doc>
