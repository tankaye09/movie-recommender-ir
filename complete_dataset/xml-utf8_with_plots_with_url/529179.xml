<plot>Roommates Rob and Kurt are essentially a modern day odd couple. Rob is tidy and well groomed where as Kurt could win the prize for "world's laziest slob". Rob wants to finally bring his girlfriend Katie over, so he asks Kurt to clean up their messy apartment. When Kurt refuses, a series of battles occur resulting in Kurt being the victor and Rob being the maid. Katie unexpectedly bursts into Rob's apartment, to find that he is dressed as a French maid. Luckily the leftovers from their battle manage to save the day, and clear Rob's name!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529179</url></doc>
