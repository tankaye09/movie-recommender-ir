<plot>Neil has been a vegetarian for one thousand two hundred and sixty three days. He and his girlfriend Daisy like to spend their days skateboarding, drinking organic coffee, and driving around talking about the state of the world. Their idyllic existence is shattered when Neil's father, Vic, reveals his grand plan for Neil to become a third generation butcher, and work with him in the Father and Son butcher shop. With no job to support himself, and nowhere else to live, Neil is left with little choice but to report to work with his father. Faced with the bloody reality of slabs of dead meat, Neil runs screaming from the shop, and keeps running and running and running, until he ends up in a deserted skateboard park. There he has a visionary encounter with a Chicken Man, who kicks his ass, and shows him how hypocritical his pseudo-political lifestyle has been. With the Chicken Man's inspirational words ringing in his head, "You know what you are supposed to do", Neil returns to his life with a mission to change the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494193</url></doc>
