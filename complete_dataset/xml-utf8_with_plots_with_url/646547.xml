<plot>"Wall Street Mafia" is based on the true story of the FBI's investigation into the mafia's involvement in Wall Street. Also to their involvement in the world of finance during the mid-1990's that ultimately led to the arrest of several hundred individuals and the shuttering of more than two-dozen brokerage firms. Against this backdrop, the film tells the story of Bobby Bataglia, a young executive who left the streets of Brooklyn for a college education and a career on Wall Street. After accepting a partnership at a supposedly reputable brokerage house, Batalgia finds out the firm is in business with the Mob. Unable to leave because of threats on his life, Batalglia finds himself caught between the Mob and the FBI's aggressive tactics to get him to talk. The story continues to unfold as Bataglia tries to escape the life he so desperately wanted to avoid as a kid on the streets of Brooklyn.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?646547</url></doc>
