<plot>A flying octopus. A Trojan horse. Two 100-foot-tall soccer players. All made out of balloons. These are just some of the masterful creations you will see as "TWISTED: A Balloonamentary" takes you right into the heart of Twist and Shout, one of the world's premier balloon twisting conventions. Exploring how eight balloon twisters' lives are dramatically changed by a little piece of latex, this hilarious and heartwarming documentary is about passion, salvation, love, death, race, religion, and a whole lot of balloons. With animation narrated by JON STEWART, "TWISTED: A Balloonamentary" is a story about people who discover that once you can make a balloon dog, you can do anything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622253</url></doc>
