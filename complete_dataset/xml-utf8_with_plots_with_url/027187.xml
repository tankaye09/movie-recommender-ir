<plot>A very large woman, wearing a shift, stands beside a bed and tries to put on a corset. After failing to get it around her, she calls her husband in. He stands behind her holding the corset and reaches around her so she can grasp and begin to tie it in front. He tightens the laces in back. She's done, and he's done in, collapsing onto the bed as she laughs and laughs at him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027187</url></doc>
