<plot>In her feature directorial debut, Charlotte Glynn moves home to chronicle her sister Rachel's last year in school. Rachel, her only sibling, is mentally retarded. The resulting film, RACHEL IS, moves past the safety of political correctness and into the most intimate and honest moments in their family's life. Rachel - mysterious, funny, and difficult - challenges her mother on a daily basis, forcing her to make tough choices about her daughter's future. Along the way Charlotte documents the tug of war between parent and child, while struggling to come to terms with her sister's disability.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453099</url></doc>
