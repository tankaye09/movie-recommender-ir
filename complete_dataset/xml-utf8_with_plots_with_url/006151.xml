<plot>Loser Charlie Wishnick, locked out of his trailer home by his awful wife, ends up in a time machine that's disguised as a taxicab. Transported to 50,000 B.C., Charlie meets cavemen and cavewomen, many of which are often nude. He falls in love and is almost eaten by a giant (played by 'Eddie Carmel' (qv) who really was a giant in real life).</plot><plot>Loser Charlie Wishnick, locked out of his trailer home by his awful wife, ends up in a time machine that's disguised as a taxicab.
