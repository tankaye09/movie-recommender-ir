<plot>On his 90th birthday in the spring of 1975, Matthew Anthony Baines, resident of the Green Meadow Nursing Home and Care Facility is visited by two lawyers, Mr. Grimm and Mr. Riley. They carry the last will and testament of the wealthy late Jansen Aaron Camerish. Matthew has been named sole heir. The lawyers are not alone. Dehalum, a mysterious, cloaked, tattooed man carrying a box wrapped in brown paper accompanies them. There is but one term one condition to the will, Matthew must agree to open the parcel in the presence of Dehalum only. Hesitant, Matthew agrees then releases his registered nurse Betty Anne Charles (the only family he has known for a decade) to the hallway just outside the door. Opening the box, he finds that he has inherited an instrument of magic, long life and great power. The Cloth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549173</url></doc>
