<plot>A Politics and African Studies graduate, Kentridge also studied mime in Paris and worked in television. Arguably South Africa's best-known artist, he was included in the 2009 Time 100 list. His work is exhibited and collected by major museums around the world. Cape Town born and UCT educated, Dumas has lived in Holland since the mid-70s. Described as 'an intellectual expressionist' and 'profoundly feminist', her work has been exhibited the world over, most recently at the MOMA New York. These two giant figures of South African art meet to discuss personal artistic process and practice, perceptions of beauty, painting, reduction, application, and the subjects and mediums that they choose. Their chat gives us a gentle insight into their work, thoughts and feelings, and a fascinating glimpse into the working reality and studios of artists who refuse to be button-holed by one genre or another.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?289732</url></doc>
