<plot>In the not too distant future the Schönborn couple want to have a child created for themselves - outside their bodies with no sex involved. To have a little daughter they can call their own is their biggest desire. It leads them to a company called LIFESENSE who seem to be able to make everything possible from the reconstruction of a partner up to full body transplants. There is one condition - the financial scope of the customer. The savings of the Schönborns don't seem to suffice but the Doc has pity on them and makes them an offer. An offer that will require extensive savings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294209</url></doc>
