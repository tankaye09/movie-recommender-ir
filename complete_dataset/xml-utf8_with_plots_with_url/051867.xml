<plot>With a few buildings and a canopied grandstand visible on the far shore, we watch motorized boats pass us on the Hudson, then pass a rowboat with a large U.S. flag and three judges. Some of the racing boats have three passengers, some have one or two. A few spectators watch from small boats near the judges. Up river, we see a large sailboat at anchor. If these are races, they appear to be against the clock rather than head to head. This is not a one-take reel, but contains splices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?051867</url></doc>
