<plot>Four stories of women attacking men for sexual pleasure. Stefan, a mechanic, is set upon by two girls in his garage. Herbert, a motorist, is confronted by a knife-wielding, leather-clad blonde in the stairway of a parking structure. Andreas, while jogging through the park is dragged from the path by a large woman. Finally, Herbert is avoiding the parking garages relying instead on public transportation.He misses his bus and accepts a ride from a young girl in a yellow sports car. They stop at a sidewalk caf√© for a drink, and while he's distracted she drops a tablet into his soda. Back in the car, Herbert starts to get drowsy. Oh no, not again!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382166</url></doc>
