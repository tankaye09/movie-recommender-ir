<plot>Addo, a mighty lion in the African Savannah, looks back on his life. At first Addo's life is perfect. His wise mother has found a perfect place for Addo and his sister's nest, where she can keep an eye on everything. She makes sure her cubs are safe, yet still manages to loosen the strings when necessary. Addo learns more and more about the world around him. Then, one day, Addo is very confused. All of the sudden the valley is empty. The gnu, zebra's, the antelopes, they're all gone, the drought has arrived. Addo finds out life isn't always paradise. There's almost no food left and the lions have to fight for even the smallest bit of meat. Addo's life will be even more shaken up by the arrival of two threatening creatures closing in from the horizon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023400</url></doc>
