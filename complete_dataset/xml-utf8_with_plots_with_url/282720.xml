<plot>Paul Meredith, the son of a wealthy manufacturer, forges his father's name to borrow money. The father finds out and disowns his son. In an attempt to get even, Paul recruits a discharged worker, Joe Prescott, to rob his father's house, but the father is killed in the robbery. Joe sends his daughter to Paul for help, but instead Paul locks her up and, by testifying against him, has Joe convicted of the murder. The girl manages to get a message to her father by throwing a note out of her window as a chaplain is passing by. When he gets the note, Joe breaks out of jail and rescues her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282720</url></doc>
