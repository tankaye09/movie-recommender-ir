<plot>FOR CAROLINE is the story of Alan Blok, an eccentric and lonely eleven year old desperately struggling to fit in at school. Alan lives at home with his oppressive grandmother who, in the wake of the deaths of his parents, resents having to take care of him. Failing to find love at home and unable to befriend the popular kids at school, Alan finds himself drawn to Caroline Alexander, an equally eccentric and endearingly enthusiastic fourth grader. However Caroline is the only person at school with fewer friends than Alan. Laughed at by his classmates and chastised by his oppressive grandmother for spending time with her, Alan ultimately must decide between his desire to be accepted and his need to accept himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199625</url></doc>
