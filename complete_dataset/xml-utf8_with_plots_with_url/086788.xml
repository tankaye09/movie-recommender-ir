<plot>Every town has its tales, its legends and its haunting myths. Deep in the heart of Clifton, Virginia, stands a notoriously haunted, dilapidated bridge that unlocks memories most would leave buried in the recesses of their conscious. The disappearance of a young girl hangs over the quiet slice of suburbia like a dense smog. A lost love and an open case may appear to be all that is at stake, but as Brock and detective Grayson descend deeper and deeper into the bone-chilling woods. What they are looking for seems just out of their grasp. What they are slowly losing may be all the more important.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086788</url></doc>
