<plot>Colin, Neil, Dexter and Darren are four friends from the East Midlands town of Sutton-in-Ashfield. They are men who are struggling to find what it means to be a man in this neo-modern world of emasculated stereotypes. Following them through their habitual routine of cruising the local town and nearby city of Nottingham, a ritual they undertake every Saturday, we learn about their lives, loves, insecurities, fears, opinions and hopes. Fearing his makeshift crew of lifelong friends is falling apart at the seams, as the guys are forced with domestic responsibilities and maturities, Colin throws down a challenge for the boys to all partake in. A visit to the local brothel. Morality and ethics enter the fray and COlin finds his ultimatum forces his friends apart and that something they wanted to last forever has inevitably come to an end. A film about holding on, but knowing when to let go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164490</url></doc>
