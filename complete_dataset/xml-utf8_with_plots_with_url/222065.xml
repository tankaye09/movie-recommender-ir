<plot>Classic in tone, modern in the details, Gravel is the story of a war-weary Navy veteran, Grace, ("Guns") O'Malley, who runs a detective agency with her young protege Dusty McGrath. A sinister businessman, Tyler Mansfield, approaches Grace to help him cover up his illicit affair with a recently murdered woman. Upon investigating, Grace discovers a shattering link to her own life - one that threatens to bring down someone she loves and destroy her reputation and career. Grace tries to hide the gritty truth from her business partner as well as from her old Navy buddy, Detective Hutchins, who is assigned to solve the murder. As she follows the clues, Grace encounters several grimy characters who inhabit the seedy world of petty criminals and prostitutes. Grace must prove who really killed the girl, negotiate for the life of her brother, (now the prime suspect in the killing), and protect herself from the horrors of war that are brought home again in this compelling film noir.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222065</url></doc>
