<plot>The Stage: Nothing good is going to come from a dead trick in a hotel bathtub. Bobby, a cynical thug and heroin addict, and Rachel, a rosary clutching prostitute, are a couple living a false reality made of hard times ugly secrets, and twisted morality. Rachel finds the dead john and instantly flashed back to the frightening similar suicide of her father six years ago. The grisly reminder forces Rachel and Bobby to a reckoning of past sins and sets their little world unraveling. How much pain must be borne, how many crosses carried, how many sins crucified with the nails of deception, before you seek Redemption? Estranged Enlightenment: Rachel decides that she has had enough, somehow she must make things right. Regaining their son, born of Bobby and Rachel's obsession; she must reconstruct a family to replace the one her sins destroyed. Bobby, losing more of himself everyday to heroin and crime, can see only pain in such a reunion. He knows that whatever Redemption two people like themselves could ever get, for what they did, would come at a high price. Compassionate Sadness: Redemption is a spotlight of the rusted parts of humanity we try to polish off. Two people drawn and held together by bad love and sickening secrets must each find atonement. It is a story of taboos, of betrayal, and of a love so simple that it should have never happened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458542</url></doc>
