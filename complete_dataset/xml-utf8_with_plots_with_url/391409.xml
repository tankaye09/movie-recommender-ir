<plot>'The Man' is a lonely, eccentric who works in a book store; amusing himself with his absurdist outlook on reality. He is sickened by his existence and becomes nauseated by the presence of others and his own boredom. His life, and mind begin to unravel when he sees 'The Woman,' an equally lonely and self medicated beauty, in a bar. He believes her to be his salvation from his isolation of the world and he begins to follow her, observing her every move. His obsessive pursuit begins to draw in the lives of other people; a family, living in the American dream, and a young man, Skylar, addicted to the care of his mother and equally as romantically involved with 'The Woman.' NAUSEA-inspired by the themes and ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre's novel of the same title-is an exploration of human desire, loneliness, and addiction. It questions the purpose of companionship as well as the depths to which someone could go to attain it. Both absurdly humorous and psychologically terrifying, NAUSEA breaks new ground in storytelling and cinematic presentation while remaining true to narrative execution and artistic integrity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391409</url></doc>
