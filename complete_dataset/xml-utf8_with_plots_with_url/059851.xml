<plot>Ajit is a poor farmer who has mortgaged his land with Zamindar Haridas. Ajit gets in the bad books of Haridas, and as a result he loses his house and property, on the very day of his sister's marriage. Ajit loses his temper and assaults Haridas, and as a result is arrested and imprisoned. His sister, Parvati, on her own now, gets molested, but is rescued in the nick of time by Haridas' son, Dr. Manohar, who eventually marries her, much to the anger of his dad. When Ajit is released from prison, he comes to Haridas' house with a sharp knife, bent on vengeance at any cost, not knowing that his sister is married in this family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059851</url></doc>
