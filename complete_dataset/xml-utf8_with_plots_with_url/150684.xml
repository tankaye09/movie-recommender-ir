<plot>All Marvin wants is to get some sleep...It just so happens, however, that a little mosquito named Zip has other plans -- and they do not include peace and quiet. But Zip means no harm. After all, he is just an ordinary father with a hungry family to answer to. Unfortunately, Marvin just happens to be the main course. And it's dinnertime.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150684</url></doc>
