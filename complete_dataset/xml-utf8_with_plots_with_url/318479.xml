<plot>For Laleh and Ladan, conjoined-twin sisters living in Iran, life has never been simple. Although they are similar to other girls their age in many ways, they must constantly confront issues of individual and shared identity as they go about their everyday lives together. Although aware that it could prove fatal for one of them, they hope to one day undergo the operation that will separate them. Sadly, in July of 2003, four years after this film was made, Ladan and Laleh both lost their lives while undergoing the surgery necessary to separate them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318479</url></doc>
