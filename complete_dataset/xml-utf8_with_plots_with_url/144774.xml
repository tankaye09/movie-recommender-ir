<plot>Does anything still excite ordinary American people? Apparently not if we take the example of the main protagonist of this documentary. He is first seen washing his car, a mundane activity. Then, to add a bit of spice to his monotonous life, the married man decides to go see a prostitute and try out sadomasochism. Nothing doing. Last, the disoriented man is seen masturbating himself amid the snow-covered nature.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144774</url></doc>
