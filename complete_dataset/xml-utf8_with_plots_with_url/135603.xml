<plot>This is a picture that is truly interesting in that it was taken during the extremely cold weather, when the Delaware River was almost frozen solid, the first time in many years. The large ferry boats are seen to labor and puff in their efforts to plow through the ice and had it not been for the city ice boats the river craft would have been at a standstill. An excellent picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135603</url></doc>
