<plot>At San Francisco's Presidio, with the hills of Marin County visible in the background, a crew of seven or eight men in bathing uniforms practice righting a capsized lifeboat. When the scene begins, the boat is on its side in the water, visible across the screen, with the men standing in the water holding the boat's sides, their backs toward us. They then pull the boat upside down, on top of them. Within a few seconds, they've flipped the boat upright and they're all inside, the captain at the back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093542</url></doc>
