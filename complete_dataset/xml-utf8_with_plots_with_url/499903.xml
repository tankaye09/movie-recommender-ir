<plot>In a oriented spin-off of the skater-punk movie 'Grind', starring Adam Brody -- Director Richard L. Fox takes the franchise into the world of television. Influenced by the original movie, and the hit song by 'Avril Lavigne', It captivates the raw emotion of high-school, from the skater teen prospective. Quoted to be Grind meets The OC, Skater Boys has the potential to be great, and the expectations are just that and more. Casting raw talent, these "real" kids take the prospect of high-school, and the passion that is skating to the next level, on their venture to go pro. Three grade nine students need to master the ultimate trick, and its not the 360 bunny hop twirl...high-school.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499903</url></doc>
