<plot>After Midnight is a collection of vampire shorts made by differing independent filmmakers from around the US. This is a sequel to Falcon Video's first vampire compilation titled "Around Midnight". Understanding the main wrap around story of After Midnight is a little hard to understand with the unintelligible dialog. What is understood is a woman picks up a book of "scary stories" involving vampires that she receives in the mail. The stories in the book are the segments through out the film. The first story, titled "I Want To Be A Vampire", is about a newspaper reporter who does a story on a woman claiming to be a vampire. Once he's in her dwelling however, they both receive a different surprise of their own. The second story is called "A Moment of Darkness". In 'Moment', a woman doctor is fascinated with vampires, logging on to vampire chat rooms, dancing at goth clubs. She finally meets one and learns how horrible it is to really be a vampire. Next story up is called "The Perfect Subject". In "Perfect Subject" a woman sells her body to grimy photographers so long as they "don't touch". When one of her photographers tries to get away with more then what her rules state; he finds himself in serious trouble. The final story actually has nothing to do with vampirisim, which is a tad confusing. It's called "No One Around". This short features underground horror icon Heidi Martinuzzi of Pretty-Scary and Horror Post fame. What I got from it was the world was ravaged by some kind of virus, and she's the last one left. It's like The Omega Man in a sense; basically she's the only one left alive, only without cool freaky mutants to encounter. This brings us back to the wrap around story...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025169</url></doc>
