<plot>It's November 2002. Kathryn, an exuberant, articulate, frustrated, and very funny out-of-work actress and environmentalist with gargantuan dreams of both stardom and world-salvation, gets particularly hot under the collar about the Bush administration's planned war on Iraq. She casts about unsuccessfully for a way to both jump-start her career and forestall the impending war. On the verge of total surrender, she unintentionally kicks off a global act of theatrical dissent: the Lysistrata Project - world-wide readings of the ancient Greek anti-war comedy "Lysistrata." After two months of 18-hour days, Lysistrata Project is a raging success, with over 1000 simultaneousÂ readings in 59 countries and in all 50 states. But after the project is over, Kathryn still doesn't have an acting career and the U.S. goes to war anyway. Ultimately, she has to learn to redefine her definitions of success and learn to take active and attainable responsibility for the course of her life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?538852</url></doc>
