<plot>There are a few milestones in every relationship: the first time you meet, the first kiss, the break-up, the marriage proposal; and you can't forget the first dinner with the family, which can feel like a job interview, a celebrity roast, and an exercise in holding your breath underwater. Nicky is a young man introducing his girlfriend Savannah to his eccentric family over dinner. Savannah meets Nick's slovenly father, his sweet Tourette's-afflicted mother, his boorish brother 'Cooler Boy'; and his ugly grandmother. As the evening progresses, the family dinner turns into Savannah's hazing ritual.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353868</url></doc>
