<plot>One of the most influential and revolutionary thinkers throughout history, Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) is tithed to a Catholic monastery at the age of eight. Leading her community of nuns, Hildegard later writes three books of theology and two books of science, including the first treatises by a woman on feminine sexuality, as well as countless letters and two biographies. The first composer whose biography is known, Hildegard scribes over seventy-seven songs and poems, including the first form of an opera. She founds two Benedictine monasteries, celebrating education, beauty and art. Hildegard struggles to survive in the medieval world, facing challenging relationships with popes, kings and bishops. Her teacher and scribe, the loving monk, Volmar, shares with her an impassioned spiritual relationship. A story of love and triumph, both earthly and Divine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082520</url></doc>
