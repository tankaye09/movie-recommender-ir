<plot>BILLY - an 8-year old Chinese boy born and bred in Belfast - is visited by his GRANNY from Hong Kong. She has not come alone; she unwittingly brings with her a GHOST - a Chinese Ghost. Back in Hong Kong, Granny is a medium interceding between her clients and their dead loved ones. The Ghost wants Granny to return to Hong Kong where all the other Ghosts are waiting for her but Billy's family want her to stay; Billy's MOTHER died in childbirth and they need Granny to look after Billy. Therefore, Billy's DAD and his older brother KENNY contrive to keep her; they embark on a series of ridiculous schemes to get rid of Granny's unwelcome Ghost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221884</url></doc>
