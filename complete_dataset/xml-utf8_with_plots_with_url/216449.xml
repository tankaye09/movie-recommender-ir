<plot>Meiko is a young woman who is working out her issues concerning the relationship she had with her father by torturing and murdering men who look like him. After she kills the father of Maki and Yoshi (skinning him alive first), the two men coerce her into joining their planned bank robbery spree. The procedure for their heists is for Meiko and Yoshi to behave in such a bizarre manner that nobody in the bank notices it's being robbed. Things go well for them at first, but eventually their individual fears and neuroses start to get the better of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216449</url></doc>
