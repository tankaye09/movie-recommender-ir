<plot>Here is a novelty. A clown presents himself accompanied by a trim little donkey, who performs a number of tricks at his master's command. Finally the clown decides to sing a song, and although you cannot hear him, you can plainly see the donkey trying to accompany his master. This is an excellent picture for an encore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?591077</url></doc>
