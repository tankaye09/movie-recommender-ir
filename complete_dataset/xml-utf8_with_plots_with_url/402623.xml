<plot>Thirty five year-old Ekke is a burnt-out real estate agent who is deliberately alienating his wife and daughter and picking fights with his mother, mistress, and his clients - all in the hope of breaking free from the monotony of his everyday existence. Desperate to spice up his life, his quest for kicks gets more and more out of control. He destroys and provokes until one night he gets hold of a knife and finds himself unable to let go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402623</url></doc>
