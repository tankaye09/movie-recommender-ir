<plot>The story of what some people believe happened to the missing Burge-Smith sisters from the local town of Northwich, Cheshire. Crystal and Ramona Burge-Smith had not spoken in years but following the death of their absent father, chose to make one final trip to The Park, a place he had frequented and loved during his life. The Park is sparse with dense woodland covering parts of the old country estate and the ruins of a 14th century mansion. On exploring the grounds the sisters soon find clues as to what happened there many years before, as we discover the park holds home to a chilling story with horrific consequences. When the girls become separated and a mysterious lady in white appears, the sisters soon realise what a godless place they have naively stumbled across.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581425</url></doc>
