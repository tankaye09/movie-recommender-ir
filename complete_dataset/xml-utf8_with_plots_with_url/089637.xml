<plot>Hank Williams Jr. is a country musician, Southern rocker and the bad-ass offspring of country's first superstar. A performer since he was 8 years old, Williams has worked with some of the biggest names in country music, including Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Charlie Daniels. His rock 'n' roll-meets-country style of music helped him win a Grammy, an Emmy and the honor of being the Academy of Country Music's entertainer of the year for three consecutive years. From surviving a 442-foot fall down the side of a mountain to scoring a hit with the NFL, this one-hour special reveals the most significant moments in Bocephus' life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089637</url></doc>
