<plot>Witness a remarkable architectural achievement: The birth of an opera house in downtown Toronto, Canada - the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. Built using a combination of advanced and traditional construction techniques, the hall is already receiving rave reviews worldwide. Experience the dual drama of the preparation of the building and the staging of the first Canadian production of Wagner's monumental Ring Cycle. Raising Valhalla profiles Architect Jack Diamond and the Canadian Opera Company's late General Director and internationally renowned Conductor, Richard Bradshaw, as they scale new heights in their already remarkable careers. The film's stunning musical soundtrack was recorded live in the house along with the footage of the production.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454241</url></doc>
