<plot>Lily (Gohar) and her college lover Vasant (Bilimoria) vow to commit suicide should circumstances prevent their marriage. Lily's father forces her to marry a barrister (Bawa) but she persuades Vasant not to kill himself. When Vasant becomes an invalid, she looks after him, causing her husband to disown and ban her from meeting their daughter. Years later, Lily becomes a servant while her daughter Indu (Gohar again) returns from England having become a lawyer. Lily meets Vasant again, who coincidentally is painting a portrait of her daughter. Their encounter leads to a renewal of their death pact but only Vasant dies while Lily is arrested for his murder. In the long trial scenes, Indu defends Lily, the prosecutor is Indu's boyfriend (Sandow) and the judge is Lily's ex-husband and Indu's father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060184</url></doc>
