<plot>Joe Prince, raised by illiterate grandparents in East Palo Alto, California suffered from autism and was told that he was unable to learn. He was initially educated by The Black Panther Party. Coached by Gold Medalist Tommie Smith, he went on to became an All-American track star. At age twenty he contracted cancer and was not expected to live. While being treated for cancer, he trained with Gold Medalist Maxie Parks and went on to run for The USA in Eastern Europe. Olympic dreams ended with the 1980 boycott of the games. Liberation Saturday is the story of this very special man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?334581</url></doc>
