<plot>Hoop Reality is the sequel to the 1995 documentary "Hoop Dreams" and  explores what happened during the last decade from where "Hoop Dreams" left off. It follows the original basketball hero past his dream and into reality, examining where life has carried him over the decade, and taking a look at where he is today, as the torch gets passed to the next dream seeker. Along the way he mentors and inspires the up-and-coming basketball star, Patrick Beverly, who leads his team, the Marshal Commandos, for the first time since the original "Hoop Dreams", to the State Finals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245211</url></doc>
