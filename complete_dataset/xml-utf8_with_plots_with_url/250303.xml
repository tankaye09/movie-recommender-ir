<plot>A young woman, maybe a student in Manhattan, asks a stranger in a cafe if she can borrow a dollar. He opens his plastic fishing tackle box and gives her his last bill, walks across the street to a liquor store, and comes back with $100 more. She drags him back and asks the clerk how the stranger got $100. From the lotto, says the clerk. The stranger's behavior is odd: he asks her the meaning of simple words, like God, bank, and girlfriend. When she asks him what he does, he tells her that he hinders pain, and as an example tells her that her wallet has just been stolen in the cafe. And so it goes: her pushy New York questions, his simple and innocent answers and actions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250303</url></doc>
