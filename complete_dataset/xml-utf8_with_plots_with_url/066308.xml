Adam's job is on the line when he is unable to sell the comic strip, "Kreature Korner," to a single newspaper. At a lunch meeting, however, an insecure editor agrees to buy the strip on the condition that Adam serve as best man at his upcoming wedding.

When Adam and Holly arrive in the small farm town of Grass Creek, Indiana, they discover that Jimmy has told everyone that he and Adam were best friends and roommates in college. And not only is the wedding threatened by the bride's ex-boyfriend, Adam cannot escape the feeling that he is reliving his own nightmare.
