<plot>Love at the Starlite Motel is a film about how Latin attitudes towards love and sex are meeting America at the intersection of 8th Street and Rte 826 in Miami. The Starlite Motel is the busiest motel in the city. It rents rooms by the hour and is one of many on 8th Street - the major east-west artery through the city and the heart of Little Havana. Motels like the Starlite are Latin American institutions that were introduced to the United States by Miami's large Cuban and Latin American population.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345321</url></doc>
