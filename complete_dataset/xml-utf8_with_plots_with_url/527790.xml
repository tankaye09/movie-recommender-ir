<plot>Hour-long series which presented bloopers preserved forever on film or videotape. After all, what actor or actress hasn't forgotten or fluffed a line, fallen down or made some other mistake while filming a show or movie? Hosts Clark and McMahon introduced the clips, usually grouped by subject or popular prime-time/syndicated show. While many outtakes were from soap operas, popular prime-time shows and current movies, anything was fair game even documentary programs about animals (usually where the animals wouldn't perform or behave or did their "thing" at the wrong time) and clips from local newscasts were fair game. During each show, the producers with the help from a few friends a usually elaborate practical joke on an unsuspecting celebrity. Other popular features included classic TV commercials or those from foreign countries; serial films from the Hollywood's early days; and comedy skits featuring Len Cella. The series was inspired by a series of popular specials that Clark and McMahon hosted in the early 1980s; each show paid tribute to Kermit Schafer, a producer who first popularized bloopers from radio's Golden Age in the 1950s. Periodic "Bloopers" specials continue to air now and then.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?527790</url></doc>
