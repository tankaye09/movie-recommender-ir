<plot>Deepak (Richard) is a budding filmmaker trying to get his first production out. He meets and falls in love with Geetha (Sridevi), and decides to take his relationship with her further once his first film is made. Misunderstandings lead to their separation, and her eventual marriage to Rajiv (Abbas), a struggling actor who is looking for a role in Deepak's next film. The director is known for his hyper-romanticism which includes overextended pensive shots of nature, insufferable and non-stop lovelorn background music and long soft-focusish close-ups. In addition, one has rather unsympathetic protagonists whose eventual demise (not a giveaway) will hurt no viewer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283870</url></doc>
