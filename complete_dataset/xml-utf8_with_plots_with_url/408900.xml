<plot>Leon's son Larry is engaged to be married to Ruth, the daughter of his boss J.B. Robbins. Before the engagement, Larry had gotten involved in a speculative investment, but now he decides to back out because he knows that Robbins disapproves of speculation. When Larry discusses the situation on the telephone, Leon overhears and misunderstands. So, when a young woman comes to their home to demand money for Larry's investment, Leon panics, assuming that Larry has gotten personally involved with her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408900</url></doc>
