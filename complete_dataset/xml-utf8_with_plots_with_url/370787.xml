<plot>Woody the Matchbox dreams of becoming a lighter and hopes he can fulfil this ambition with the help of Antus the Cactus, whom he meets in the Mexican desert. Bob Brakinlot is a criminal looking to go straight; when he meets Blossom Shirtz, a shirt whose life has been ripped apart, he gets the chance to move on if only they can put their pasts behind them. A young egg escapes from his fridge to go on a quest to meet Michael Jackson, only to meet a gorilla who is searching for his lost family. These collections of stories are told in animations, based on scripts by young children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370787</url></doc>
