<plot>For Chris Hansen, life was supposed to be simple. At 19, he would embark on his Mormon mission - a two year religious commitment that would affirm his faith and secure respect in his community. But no one ever prepared him for what he might leave behind... As his mission nears, Chris' relationship with his non-Mormon girlfriend, Melissa, escalates. While his bishop father expects him to live by the strict tenants of their moral code, Chris cannot deny his feelings for Melissa. Soon, Chris finds that he must choose, between the faith he lives by, and the girl he loves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474100</url></doc>
