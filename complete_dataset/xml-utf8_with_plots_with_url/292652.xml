<plot>The young rookie Johnson joined the cause to help end the war and do something good for his corporation. He gets partnered with legendary sniper, Quinn who is more concerned with beating the confirmed kill record than doing any good. Johnson learns that his parents never died in a car accident as he was told, but was murdered by the very corporation he fights for. He's in immediate danger and has no where to turn but his adoptive father Jacob. Johnson is awakened in the middle of the night by Quinn for an 'emergency' sniper mission. Is this mission real, or is Johnson in trouble. Quinn only needs one more kill to beat the record and Johnson might be the winning shot.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292652</url></doc>
