<plot>Mathias Drukker, a retired printer, has been hiding the Rosenberg family from the Nazis in the attic of a northern European town, providing them with food, water, and the occasional bottle of schnapps. Unfortunately for the Rosenbergs, however, the year is in fact 1991, and they are the descendants of the original families, kept in the dark as to the outcome of World War II by two generations of psychopaths. When 16 year old Adele discovers an escape route to the outside world, she must choose between her own freedom and saving her family. Drukker, however, will kill to protect his secret hobby. Who will survive the ensuing bloodbath?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586165</url></doc>
