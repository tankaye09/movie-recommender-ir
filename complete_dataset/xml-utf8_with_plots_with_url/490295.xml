<plot>A 4x4 journey through the western desert of Egypt reveals and warms the cold peace between Egypt and Israel. This unknown and mysterious land with only a few records of people who actually have lived here yet unfolds stories of major historic events and human mankind. Driving in the historic footsteps of adventurers, armies, explorers, caravans of slaves and wanderers throughout several hundreds and thousands of years. This passage leads through old villages, beautiful desert oases, oceans of sands, natural springs, lakes and fascinating historic sites. We discover the present culture of the few inhabitants of the oases in the western desert, a culture that hardly changed over the past hundred years. Along the anthropological present stories we will tell the historic, archaeological stories - following the path of this journey.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490295</url></doc>
