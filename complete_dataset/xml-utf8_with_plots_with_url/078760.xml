<plot>The Beijing Modern Dance Company is China's avant-guard dance troupe, led by Willy Tsao - the father of modern dance in China. He has been struggling for years to advance modern dance in China, where it is inherently political: it unleashes the Artist as an individual, feed from collective ideology and tradition. As a result, he invites Montreal choreographer Nadin Thouin to experience the struggle and reward of artistic cross pollination by working with his BMDC and 12 of the top dancers in China This film follows Nadine and partner Jerry Snell (ex-Carbone 14) as she jumps into the biggest show of her independent career: 6 weeks to create BONE, under-funded and unable to speak Chinese. The vérité/performance film follows the creation process in Beijing, then an intense tour through China and Canada.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078760</url></doc>
