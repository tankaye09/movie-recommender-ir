<plot>Ble is a weird guy because he has two different selves that can be switched into Ble "A" and Ble "B everyday" when he wakes up in the morning. Anyway, Ble doesn't feel it's weird and lives as a normal guy by having a job at 7-Eleven. His two dual characters always confusing his customers and co-workers at 7-Eleven, but that's not a big deal as long as he can make people laugh. Ble is happy with his life and job until one day that a girl called Tau steps into 7-Eleven to be his assistant. From that day, Tau is the only girl that Ble falls in love with, but Ble's unusual talent becomes a big problem for her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454619</url></doc>
