<plot>Jerry is a rebellious high school student, who refuses to listen to teachers, adults or anyone in authority. He rides his bicycle in traffic, believes that rules "aren't made for me, " and finally goes over the line when he sneaks into a science lab and spray-paints a lab coat. Quick detective work pins the caper on Jerry, and as he sits outside the principal's office, awaiting his punishment, he reflects on the path his nonconformity has taken him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069620</url></doc>
