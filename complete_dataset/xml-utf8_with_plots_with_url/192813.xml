<plot>This scene and others which follow were taken under the direction of the United States Fisheries Commission and used in the elaborate Biogen display in the U.S. Fisheries exhibit, Pan American Exposition. This scene shows the Fisheries commission agent aboard a fishing boat at sea stripping freshly caught female cod of roe and fertilizing the roe for the hatcheries. A very unique and interesting subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192813</url></doc>
