<plot>This documentary has been shot during three months on the Yamal Peninsula in West Siberia, where the Nenets have been herding reindeer for about a thousand years. Times ago reindeer herders were assembled into state farm brigades. The Yar-Sale sovkhoz includes 22 brigades, each of which looks after several hundred thousand reindeer. In a year, a brigade travels several thousand kilometres. The calving time in spring, the ty nintch, is the busiest time of the year. The brigade has to make sure that the new-born calves keep up with the herd - bigger rivers must be crossed before the ice breaks. During the polar summer, people work also at night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546080</url></doc>
