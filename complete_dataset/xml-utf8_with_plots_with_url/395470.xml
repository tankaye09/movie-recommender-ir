<plot>Nicholas is a young autistic. He lives in a world in which he cannot control his perception. His ear focuses on sounds that only he can hear. It is both a gift and a malediction. People cannot hear them or think that they are insignificant. To him, these sounds are painful and aggressive. His life is focused on routine. He goes to the same shop everyday, and feeds a dog at his parent's pub. Until he meets the strange Mr Kass.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?395470</url></doc>
