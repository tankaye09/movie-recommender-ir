<plot>On his thirteenth birthday, Kevin wishes that his dog, Danny, could be a real friend to him. Upon waking up the next morning, he finds that his furry friend has actually become human! Thanks to Danny's dog-like characteristics, he is able to become exceptionally popular in school and brings Kevin up with him. But when the girl of Kevin's dreams, Mary, falls for Danny instead of him, he quickly shuns him, forgetting what a great friend he had always been.
