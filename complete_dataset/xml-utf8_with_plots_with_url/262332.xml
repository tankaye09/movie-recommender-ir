<plot>An elderly woman named Margret has a blown tire on her car and a man named Joe who is laid off from work, stops on the highway to help her. Joe fixes her tire and she wants to give him money for helping her, but he just wanted to help her and does not want any money. Later that night, Margret stops in a resturant and sees a waitress who hosts her. The waitress is pregnant and Margret can tell she is exhausted. When the bill comes, she gives the waitress a $100 bill and then takes off. When the waitess comes back with her change which is about $96, she sees the that Margret already left and looks on a napkin which reads, "For the baby, have a great night."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262332</url></doc>
