<plot>Oliver Cromwell was born in relative obscurity in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, but he was to rise to prominence as one of the greatest generals and statesmen that Britian has ever produced. He was one of the leading lights in the Great Revolution and Civil War which saw the overthrow of the British monarchy. Cromwell was victorious in almost every battle in England, Scotland and Ireland, throughout the civil wars. Increasingly isolated during a decade of turbulent political upheaval, he presided over the Commonwealth and the Protectorate and although he had refused the Crown, by the end of his life he was effectively ruling Britain as King in all but name.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327684</url></doc>
