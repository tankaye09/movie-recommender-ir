<plot>Anil and Tina are madly in love with each other. They argue fiercely but their love overcomes all arguments. Tina is from a rich family, Anil is from modest means. Whey they approach their respective families for approval for marriage, both families reject this. But Tina's grandfather, who has a modern outlook towards life, proposes a "trial marriage" for two months where they will have to live within Anil's meagre means. They can spend the day together but at nights Anil returns to his home. Both Anil and Tina agree to this, as they are confident their love will overcome any challenges along the way. Their families are sceptical but agree to the arrangement. As expected, a lot of challenges do come the way of both Anil and Tina during this "trial marriage". Do they survive these ? Or do the harsh realities of "married life" finally bring both of them back to their "practical" senses ?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168309</url></doc>
