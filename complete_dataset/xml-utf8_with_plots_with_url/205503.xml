<plot>Franny's husband has just died after a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Her daughter, Clarice and granddaughter, Deak, have arrived for the lonely funeral. They chat briefly about how life was with him. The last months of his life were spent with a rare smile on his face which Franny liked as a change, even though it was only caused by the disease 'freezing' it there. Although at first there is inevitable tension between the three women, as the afternoon draws on they reconcile some differences and reaffirm their bonds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?205503</url></doc>
