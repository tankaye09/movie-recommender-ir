<plot>1 city block, 2 contestants, and 24 hours. On this game show, people from the same block compete for the title of BLOCK MASTER and up to one year of rent money. Participants are GROUNDED for 24 hours - not permitted to set foot off the block - while they face a series of high-intensity block-specific challenges, scavenger hunts, and mind f**ks. Along the way they encounter several BLOCKSTACLES (obstacles intended to slow them down, screw them up, and test their will). Meanwhile, the scorecard at the bottom of the screen tracks their progress, determining the most block-savvy contestant of the group. After the competition, the block King/Queen is crowned at an MTV-hosted block party, and a rent check is handed over. The loser is forced to leave the block and watch the rest of the party from across the street.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075019</url></doc>
