<plot>Miss Johnson, suffering from a decayed tooth decides to go to the dentist. The picture shows her entering the office and after the usual preliminaries, she is seated in the chair and the dentist prepares for action. He uses a large pair of gas-plyers on the old lady, and after repeated efforts, he finally extracts a tooth which in size resembles that of a horse. In the meantime, the lady has suffered so much pain from the operation, that she attacks the dentist with a vim and beats him to a standstill.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232560</url></doc>
