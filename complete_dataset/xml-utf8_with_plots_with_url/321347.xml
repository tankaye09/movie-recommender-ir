<plot>"Particularly interesting was a warship at the time when our country was plunged in a war with the Spanish Dons, and it is gratifying to the American public to see these monster marine fighters on which so much depends and on which we have placed all our hopes. In this picture is shown our largest and most powerful battleship of the first-class, the Alabama, being launched at Cramp's shipyard, Philadelphia, May 18, 1898. Words fail to describe the immensity of this wonderful floating fort of steel. It is conceded that the Alabama is without a peer for armament, size and capability. This is a film that will enthuse old and young America, and any one exhibiting it will be in a position to command crowded audiences wherever he appears."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321347</url></doc>
