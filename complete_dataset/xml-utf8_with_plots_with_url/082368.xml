<plot>Everyone wants to know. Is Dan Brown's best selling fiction thriller "The Da Vinci Code" novel, really fact or fiction? Was Jesus really married to Mary Magdalene? Was she one of his disciples? Did they have a child together that became France's royal bloodline? Did Catholic secret societies hide these and many other secrets about Jesus? Were famous people like Leonardo Da Vinci and Sir Isaac Newton in on the secrets? Did Leonardo try to warn us through "The Last Supper" painting? Based on three best-selling books-"Breaking the DaVinci Code", "The DaVinci Deception" and "Cracking DaVinci's Code"-this program solves a 2000 year old mystery! "Breaking the DaVinci Code" answers all the lingering questions and finally sets the record straight-through interviews with book authors and the world's leading experts in archeology, theology, art history, philosophy and science.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082368</url></doc>
