<plot>Honest and diligent Police Inspector Amar lives a middle-classed lifestyle in Bombay. In his attempt to arrest bandit Sher Singh, he and Inspector Dayal are attacked, Amar survives, but Dayal gets his legs crushed under a truck and becomes wheelchair-bound. Subsequently, Amar arrests local politician, Jagannath Prasad, who not only gets released without getting charged but Amar gets reprimanded, and decides to resign. Shortly thereafter, Sher Singh hijacks a bus and holds the passengers in exchange for 25 of his jailed associates. Dayal's granddaughter, Seema, is amongst them, and Dayal asks Amar for assistance. Amar, along with ex-convict, Qasim Ali, and Karan, a drug-dealer, does manage to rescue them but differences crop up between the trio and they part ways. Then Amar finds out that Qasim and Karan have masterminded a plan to facilitate the escape of the 25 convicts, and decides to confront them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340384</url></doc>
