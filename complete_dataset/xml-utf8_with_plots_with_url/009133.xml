<plot>"Why would I need a dad? Dads are out. Two of my friends have got them and they just shout and stress all the time. What's the point in having a dad?" Aina Westlye is the ultimate contemporary urban teenager. Cool, sassy and incredibly confident, Aina has never met her dad. Doesn't even have a photo. But no sympathy, please. Aina is happy with her dadless life. Over her nineteen years she's formed the opinion that dads are simply unnecessary. Aina tests her theory that you don't need a dad. She meets a selection of dads to find out what they're for, starting with a trip to the Home Counties for Sunday lunch with a 'perfect' dad and his family. She takes on George, who infuriates Aina by labelling her dangerous because she challenges the traditional family status quo. In her quest Aina also visits a Christian Great Dads conference and asks a speaker "do you think I need a dad?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009133</url></doc>
