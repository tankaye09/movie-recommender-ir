<plot>Everyone has an agenda. That's what it seems like to Collin (James Gilbert), a man used to being in charge who, after going on the run, wakes up to find himself in a stark white room with seemingly no power over his surroundings. As Collin struggles to understand his current predicament he is vexed by three entirely different beings: the hulking Cal (Jeremie Cook), who attempts to physically intimidate him by battering him into submission; the confusing Claudia (Aleisha Force), who batters his mind by talking in circles always keeping the truth just out of reach; and the alluring Clover (Leslie Patrick), who tries to charm him into her way of thinking. Collin is forced to trust one of them. If he chooses wrong, he may never get out of The Room.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?587707</url></doc>
