<plot>Two Bit Days tells the story of a day in the life of Ben, a cowboy who needs wide open spaces, but has to work in the city to pay for those wide open spaces. His way of life isn't easy, but it's necessary for him to survive. All of his friends and co-workers seem intent on fixing him up with their version of the "right" woman. Ben's heard it all before, and the well-meaning "set ups" grate on his nerves. But fate steps into the picture and delivers a "new woman" in Ben's small town. He takes a chance and finds his world turned upside down, much to the amusement of the town gossips. Two Bit Days is a slice of life comedy film about living the way we choose to live and the price we pay. It's about the day when fate throws you a curve ball, and you can either step up to the plate, or walk away from the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622335</url></doc>
