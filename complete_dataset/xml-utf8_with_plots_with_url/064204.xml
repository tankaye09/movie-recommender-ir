<plot>DJ, Donny, Danny, and Dougie are former members of the musical group D4; a semi-popular boy-band that existed in the eighties. DJ, the lead singer of the band, is not happy with his life and secretly desires to have the band reunite. He also feels strongly that D4 was ahead of its time and is convinced of that because of the many boy-bands flooding the radio airwaves today. The other band members, however, have long since moved on: Donny is an IT Director, Danny is married with four small children, and Dougie is the mascot for a local restaurant. DJ is finally inspired to make a major life change after a strange music video style of a dream in which the band is back together. Upon waking, he quits his job within minutes of starting work for the day. As if a large weight has been lifted off his shoulders, DJ emphatically starts off on his quest to convince the other band-mates to reunite.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064204</url></doc>
