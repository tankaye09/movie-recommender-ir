<plot>Arthur Godfrey introduced a variety of talent to televison. He had a certain folksy warmth, dry wit, and an easygoing manner that was one of the main attractions to the show. He had a strong audience that followed him several years. When he gave commercials personally, it was in a laid-back manner and non-traditional in tone and manner of deliverance. He could have a certain irreverence about subjects that would crop up on his show and never seemed to hold back his true feelings. Behind the scenes he had constant troubles with his cast and staff which caused a lot of speculation in the newspapers. Some of the talent on the show went on to becoming well known. The McGuire Sisters were an example.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529776</url></doc>
