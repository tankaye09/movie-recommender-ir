<plot>The tomb is here seen, with the great stone rolled away. Outside are two soldiers who have been guarding the body of Jesus. Near the door stand two angels with outstretched wings, invisible to the guards. Mary Magdalene is seen approaching the tomb. She discovers the body of Jesus has been carried away and beckons to Peter and John, who come to the tomb, and stand looking therein. The angels disappear and Mary sees Jesus standing by and mistakes Him for the gardener. Christ is recognized and they all fall upon their faces and worship Him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425398</url></doc>
