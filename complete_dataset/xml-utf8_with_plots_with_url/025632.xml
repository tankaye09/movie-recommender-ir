<plot>A melodramatic film with an obvious disposition toward social critique. A poor and honest young man - as is usually the case in films like this - tries hard to improve his life and prospects, but since he is an impulsive character, with a rebellious temper, he faces many difficulties. He works as a photo-journalist and is in love with a girl who abandons him when he is forced to perform his military service. After his discharge from the army, she looks for him, and despite the relatively long duration of their two-year separation, their relationship is renewed. Noteworthy is the contribution of the poet Thomas Gkorpas, who wrote the screenplay.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025632</url></doc>
