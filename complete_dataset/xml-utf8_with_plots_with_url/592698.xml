<plot>Having been through a rocky patch Jonny has promised to make a real effort to save their failing relationship. Suzy's is making an effort to cook a romantic meal to mark the occasion. Just as the celebratory cork is popped Suzy hears Jonny at the front door he enters the kitchen full of aromas which seem to elude his sense of smell. He comes bearing gifts, surely this must be a good sign. Jonny obviously in a hurry thrusts her a present, Suzy stands bewildered by the whole situation but excitedly opens her present. Great what she had always wanted another football shirt! Jonny looks like he's given her the crown jewels and declares kick off is about to happen as he disappears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592698</url></doc>
