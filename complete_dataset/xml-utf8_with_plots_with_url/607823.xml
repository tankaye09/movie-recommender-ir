<plot>Her husband died ten months ago. Now THEA (56) lives a completely retired life, everyday problems are simply too much for her. KATIE (25) persuades her into going on a short holiday to Italy together. She wants to bring her mother back to life. Katie tries to suppress the tragic incident, without confessing that she is struggling with her personal future as well. Years of speechlessness between mother and daughter and the inability to talk about feelings reach a climax within the few days of their voyage. Underneath the surface a fateful decision is in store: Will Katie and Thea find mutual understanding, a kind of understanding they never experienced before? Or will they risk their relationship forever?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?607823</url></doc>
