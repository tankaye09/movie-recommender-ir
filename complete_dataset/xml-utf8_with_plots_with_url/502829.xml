<plot>_"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" (1967)_ (qv) started out as a typical comedy/variety program. When the show began (and continued) to use humor/satire to criticize America's involvement in the Vietnam War, CBS network censors and executives were, to say the least, nervous. This Bravo cable channel documentary tells what happened behind the scenes at the network, how the people involved were affected, and why the show was ultimately cancelled. Many of those who were involved directly with the show are interviewed, including performers, writers, and former CBS executives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502829</url></doc>
