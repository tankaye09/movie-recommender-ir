<plot>Christopher Summa's BE MY BROTHER is a 15-minute film that is inspired by both biblical and current events. It asks the timeless question of humanity: Can we treat the person whom we do not know, the stranger whom we fear and maybe even see as the enemy, as a brother? Shot on the streets of New York City the film celebrates the idea that every person has a dream and that it is never too late to be a pioneer of peace and truth in this world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061737</url></doc>
