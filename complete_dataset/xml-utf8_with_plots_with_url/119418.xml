<plot>The film opens on Khaled busy at work. Another art student, working along side of him, comments on Khaled's work, giving him constructive criticism. Khaled misinterprets this as a jab at his artwork, cursing the other student in Arabic. The scene ends with tensions high and frustration growing between Khaled and the other student. Later, at the gallery opening, an innocent remark by a gallery patron sets Khaled off once again, whose intensity pushes away the woman. The other art student notices this, and reassures Khaled, remarking that his art is very popular and that he is "selling a ton." Before Khaled can tell the other student this is not his reason for making art, the student walks away. Realizing his mistake, he apologizes to the woman, giving her the drawing she was so impressed by.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119418</url></doc>
