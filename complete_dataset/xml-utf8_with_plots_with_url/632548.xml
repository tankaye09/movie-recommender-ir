<plot>In Part One of the series we tackle questions surrounding what is harmful to our body image. Ray Winstone, Jodie Kidd, Rankin, and Damien Hirst amongst others discuss their thoughts on this issue. Programme Two focuses on Sex and Attraction and takes a look at real peoples relationship with themselves and each other. We uncover the intimate associations we have with our own and our partner's bodies and look at beauty and what it means to people in terms of attraction. The final Programme is about the transformation of bodies in order to reach an aesthetic or idealized goal. We speak to bodybuilders, dieters and people who want cosmetic surgery, plus of course the usual mix of celebrities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632548</url></doc>
