<plot>"Bitch." is a character study focusing on Simon, a dried-up trust fund brat who's still trapped in the "Party Monster" era of the early 90s. After falling for Angel, Simon slowly starts to see that his life isn't what it used to be. He also doesn't realize that Angel is just using him for his money and connections. But when Simon learns that all of his money is gone, Angel - faced with the threat of losing his meal ticket - dumps Simon and, to make matters worse, tells all of their "friends" that Simon is totally washed up. One fateful night, while Simon is still living delusions of grandeur at his favorite downtown haunt, he spots Angel and decides to have the last word. "Bitch." presents the underground club scene as a battleground where youth and beauty reign supreme, where icy glares are weapons of choice and where whispered gossip can either make you...or destroy you.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072087</url></doc>
