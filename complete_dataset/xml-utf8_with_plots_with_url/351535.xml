<plot>Police Inspector Bhagat Singh has been assigned to investigate the death of a gangster named Moosa, and the brutal killing of his daughter in broad daylight by setting her afire. His investigation concludes that the person responsible for this is notorious gangster Gawda, and he arrests him and his son, and holds them in prison. The next day, both Gawda and his brother are released by Court orders, and a few days later Bhagat Singh is killed. His brothers, Fauji Ajit and Jai Singh, decide to find out who was behind his killing, as the police have been unable to apprehend anyone. They find out that Bhagat's murder was sponsored by the police themselves, and now their very lives are in danger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351535</url></doc>
