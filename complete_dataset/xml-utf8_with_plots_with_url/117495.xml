<plot>Set in the majestic sand dunes of Long Island, COYOTE BEACH is a fresh look at the age-old question that plagues every couple; namely, who wears the pants in the family? The dynamics of power between the protagonists seem to shift with the tide as they - just like every generation before them - fight their own version of the battle of the sexes: She's French, gorgeous, successful, and superior, having just landed a leading role in a film opposite Sean Connery. He is an acting hopeful, a Jewish cowboy from New Jersey, so paralyzed with fear and indecision that his life is going nowhere. Long-overdue con?icts erupt and hilarious dialogue ensues as the two fall in and out of love in the course of an afternoon at the beach. In the end, old issues are resolved but new ones take their place. And through it all imaginary coyotes lurk in the background... or do they?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117495</url></doc>
