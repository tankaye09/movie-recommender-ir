<plot>This Film follows Tehran born but London raised hip hop artist Reveal as he strives to reconcile his competing British and Iranian identities. Along the journey we find out about the banned '0-21' Iranian rap movement, which the Iranian government see as a form of Western decadence and the emotional back-story of the death of Reveal's father, the prize winning photographer, who was killed whilst covering the recent Iraq War for the BBC.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580004</url></doc>
