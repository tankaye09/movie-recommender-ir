<plot>Four part series where art critic, journalist and broadcaster Matthew Collings looks closely at the work of four of the world's greatest painters and their relevance for us today: Titian, Rubens, Vel√°zquez and Hogarth. He believes that they are linked by a sense of paint - having an expressive rich luxurious life of its own. In the history of art this is the stream of painterly painting. In addition to looking at key works, Collings looks at their individual lives and the worlds in which they lived in order to unlock their work for the contemporary viewer in new and exciting ways.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361271</url></doc>
