<plot>Four young men, all commanders in the same Israeli Defense Force Golan Heights paratrooper unit, were killed over a 22-month period from 1995 to 1997. Their families, realizing they all suffer a common fate, agree to meet and share their stories. With great sensitivity and skill, director Ayelet Bargur, whose brother Zvi was among those who died, documents the ongoing attempts by these families to come to terms with the deaths of their loved ones. This painful subject is one that touches many Israeli families today. Also directed by Ayelet Bargur: As if Nothing Happened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049679</url></doc>
