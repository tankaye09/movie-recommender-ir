<plot>Bandit Denver Dooley travels to a lawless western town where he notices a sign, "No Bandits Allowed. Signed, Marshall Woody Woodpecker". Dooley pays no heed to the sign and confronts a Mexican who claims to know about the bird but in the end, just says, "I don't know him, Senor!" Dooley causes trouble at a bar and marshall Woody steps in. Dooley demands a showdown which Woody keeps besting him at. Dooley chases after the redhead asking the Mexican for directions (The Mexican again says, "I don't know him, Senor!"). After a few more chase gags, Dooley again encounters the Mexican and asks for directions. At this point, the Mexican reveals himself to have been Marshall Woody all along and arrests Dooley (still saying, "I don't know him, Senor!").</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421664</url></doc>
