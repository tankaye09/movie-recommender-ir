<plot>"This film is particularly interesting at the present time, as it shows how the Spanish soldiers amuse themselves when in camp. They are seen dancing and apparently singing in the absence of music. It is decidedly full of action and is portrayed clearly and distinctly on the screen. The Spaniards, of whom so much has been said, are enjoying themselves as best they can, and they present a gay sight to the civilian, who expects to see fierce and grim warriors, dancing and shouting like schoolboys at play. This is a beautiful and lively subject the figures standing out clear and bold, and the faces are perfect."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206733</url></doc>
