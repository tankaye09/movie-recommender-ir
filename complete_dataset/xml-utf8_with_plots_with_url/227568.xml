<plot>Appears to be half hour mystery show, with episodes hosted by Vincent Price, and occasionally starring him, as well. The episodes were probably written by different writers, and served as a format for their works to be seen. For Episode "Freedom to Get Lost" - Vincent Price gets lonely, picks up a stranger (Marian Seldes), and takes her back to his VERY quiet apartment. Their conversation indicates that he may have killed a psychiatrist with the same name as his guest. But is she who she claims to be? For a 27 minute episode, some modern TV shows should be jealous of this good a story!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227568</url></doc>
