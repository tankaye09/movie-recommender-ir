<plot>With unprecedented access behind the scenes, FIGHTER takes an irreverent yet brutally honest look at the world of Reality fighters from their own perspective, through tournaments, training, and daily lives. From gentle giant Randy "The Natural" Couture attempting to re-gain the Ultimate Fighting Championship's heavyweight crown to Victoria Schiltz winning inspiration from her boyfriend/manager's ringside cheers, World Cup gold medalist and training guru Rico Chiapparelli's analysis of what makes a great fighter to a first-hand look at what it's like to step into the octagon for the first time, FIGHTER deftly captures the skill, dedication, rivalry, camaraderie, and tremendous mutual respect among our country's "ultimate" athletes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193827</url></doc>
