<plot>Everyone lives comfortable, predictable lives. Everyone except the four residents of 734 Leary Way. Hunter is a young man living on his own for the first time and trying to live a life according to ideals from childhood television shows. Timoney is a free-spirited girl that often puts her energy behind causes without really caring about them - she has even gone so far as to vow silence to save the manatees. Astro is a man struggling to hold onto the 1970s. Amber is a lovely and kind young woman trying to hold this group together as they are faced with an unjust eviction. The notice comes from the head of the housing board, Victor Wrathburn. Abusing and clinging to all the power he can muster, Victor has turned his anger against the four tenants because he fears they are disrupting the Harmony. Now, Hunter must overcome his reluctance to be a hero and lead his friends and the entire community against this tyrant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230675</url></doc>
