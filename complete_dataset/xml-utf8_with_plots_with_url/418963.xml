<plot>It is time for death row inmate Henry "The Overkiller" Graham to meet his fate. But is it the electric chair...or something far worse? The Overkiller - the most gruesome, over-the-top, excessive, more-than-enough, ridiculous, abundantly effective and extreme serial killer is...Henry? The authorities certainly think so and have thrown him in the slammer. But beautiful, young Carrie has fallen for this seemingly average former retail store worker and has decided to pursue him and bring him into her heart and home. What follows is your regular dysfunctional family comedy with a few slight twists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418963</url></doc>
