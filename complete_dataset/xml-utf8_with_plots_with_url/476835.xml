<plot>Raghavendra, Vishnu, Chinna, and Vamsi are brothers. Raghavendra and Anjali (Arti Agarwal) fall in love and they are relatives as well. They get engaged with the consent of parents. But Raghavendra's family looses everything they have due to certain incident. Anjali's parents reject Raghavendra on the basis of poverty. Raghavendra decides that he should make good money, buy a house and have all comforts before marriage. He achieves his targets. Then he marries a good-hearted and responsible girl. Later on, they settle Vishnu's match with the sister of Anjali. Vishnu's wife is a woman of jealous nature and short temper. Due to her jealous behavior, there are certain problems. The rest of the film is all about how these strong-willed brothers keep the joint family together and reap the benefits of it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476835</url></doc>
