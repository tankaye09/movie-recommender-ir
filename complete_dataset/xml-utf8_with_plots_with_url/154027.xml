<plot>This contemporary Bestiary takes a subversive and tongue in cheek look at the relationships between girls and dogs. A documentary, a love poem to the dog. As told by a delicious medley of images, texts and voices from Piero di Cosimo to Joan Baez to Enid Blyton to Virginia Woolf to the girl next door. These girls have distant encounters with their dogs whilst grown women tell their stories of childhood pets, family malaise and repressed sexual tensions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154027</url></doc>
