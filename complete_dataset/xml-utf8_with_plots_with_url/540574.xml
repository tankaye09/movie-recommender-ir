<plot>Medieval times. A jester is heading to the castle, but can't help running into a fruit tree in his path. Again and again. After a while, he lands nose-down and when he gets up, his nose remains stuck in the ground. He gives up, and we see that "wise" people aren't faring much better. He returns to his master, who gives him a replacement nose and sets off on an easier path.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540574</url></doc>
