<plot>At Shaolin Temple in Hunan, the best at Kung-Fu are Yin, a willowy young woman who has mastered supernatural powers, and Loon, a small boy who's a Dervish at martial arts. They go to Hawaii for a world competition, and their government assigns So, the delegation head, to find a missing nuclear code key before it falls into the hands of an underworld figure in Hawaii. Comrade So is kidnapped and tortured; Yin and Loon must rescue him. They're aided by a handsome young man and a chubby extroverted boy whom Yin rescues by chance from thugs. These two Hawaiians turn out to have a connection to Shaolin Temple. That connection proves to be a God-send.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670646</url></doc>
