<plot>Public morality, late night cavorting, and a practical joke. A constable and a subway attendant are working late at night in an underground station. A well-dressed man and two well-dressed women of the night enter the platform, and they are soon in trouble for violating public decorum. Another man arrives, carrying a long package. A train arrives to our right and the man with the package boards. Soon, to the consternation of the constable, women's legs (in hose) are on full display. The constable will have none of it. Will there be an arrest?</plot><plot>Public morality, late night cavorting, and a practical joke. A constable and a subway attendant are working late at night in an underground station.
