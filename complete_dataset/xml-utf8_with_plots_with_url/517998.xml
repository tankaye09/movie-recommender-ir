<plot>"This is an arranged scene worked out very effectively. At its opening two rowdies are seen engaged in a street fight. A crowd collects, and a policeman with difficulty separates the combatants. They are quickly subdued, however, and a police patrol dashes up, and into it the two prisoners are bundled and carried off."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517998</url></doc>
