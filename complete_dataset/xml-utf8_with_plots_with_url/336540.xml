<plot>Marcelo is a non-religious young man, an actor and a single parent to his eleven years old daughter, Lucy. He's desperately looking for someone to help him improve his Hebrew accent. So he can pass the auditions for an Israeli Soap Opera. Anat, his religious teacher, is probably the best solution, but it seems that she hates soap operas, and is not so fund of her pupil either. In fact, she has her own problems: mainly her mother, Bruria, an energetic, not to say pushy lady, frantically seeking a perfect match for her daughter who has, in her eyes, clearly passed the proper wedding age.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336540</url></doc>
