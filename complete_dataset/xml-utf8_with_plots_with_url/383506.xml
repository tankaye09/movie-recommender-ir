<plot>My Change Adds Up, dictates the daily changes that have occurred since the Recession. Even through the loss of jobs, homes, and a fallen economy, it may not always seem clear, but change is still coming. Our change is always adding up and counts on all of us to be apart of it. Through change adding up as coins, it illustrates the patience, hope, and struggle it takes to move towards progress in our communities as well as our country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383506</url></doc>
