<plot>Friday morning, April 1st. A sleeping Jessica Latham is chloroformed. Her husband Michael calls a friend on the phone and gets his answering machine. While he leaves the message, he's murdered and made to look like he overdosed. However, the murder is recorded onto his friend's machine over the phone. The killer is in a quandary. He must retrieve the tape or risk having his plans shattered. Eddie Flanders, a school teacher, is the unfortunate recipient of the grisly recording. Flanders discounts it as an April Fool's joke. After narrowly escaping an attempt on his life he seeks answers from his deceased friend's wife. The two set out to find the murderer with the help of a detective nearing retirement. No one can be trusted as they're drawn further into a web of corruption, deception and murder - all leading to a violent showdown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435168</url></doc>
