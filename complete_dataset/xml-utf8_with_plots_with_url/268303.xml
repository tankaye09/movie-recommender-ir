<plot>Two men, one a Mexican day laborer here illegally, the other a recently unemployed blue-collar worker hitchhiking to his relatives home in a small New Mexico town find themselves unexpectedly alone together after the pickup truck they are riding in breaks down in a remote area. The hitchhiker takes the opportunity to release his anger and frustration on the young Mexican, blaming him for all of his, and society's, current problems and challenges, at times appearing to be on the verge of violence. When the threat of violence eases, the Mexican day laborer takes his turn at explaining and defending, angrily at times, why he does what he has to, for both himself and his family back in Mexico. In the end, while no answers or solutions are obvious, the two men find some of the truths of the issue apply to both of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268303</url></doc>
