<plot>George, an Atlanta auto mechanic and self-appointed "soldier of Christ," has embarked on a tortured quest to investigate lifestyles he regards as rejected by God. On the street, in clubs, and in private homes, his interviews with a wide range of people reveal their struggles to accept themselves and in so doing, begin to illuminate for George his own history and demons. As the interviews delve into the peoples' pasts, George's defenses against childhood memories begin to erode. And as his personality structure deteriorates, so do his personal relationships, even as his history of child abuse begins to emerge into consciousness. This drama of disintegration progresses through George's failure to forge a lasting relationship and concludes with his shattering understanding that he has rejected himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666739</url></doc>
