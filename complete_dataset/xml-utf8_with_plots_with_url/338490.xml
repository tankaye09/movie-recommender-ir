<plot>Based on the novel by CA Jones, 'Little Sir Nicholas' is a story set in the Victorian era about heritage, identity and family rivalries. It was always the destiny for the sons of the wealthy and proud Tremaine family of Cornwall to join the Royal Navy but this legacy seems doomed to end when Sir Walter Tremaine, his wife and his four-year-old son Nicholas drown when their ship capsizes in stormy weather. Five years later, Lady Tremaine-- still yet to come to terms with the loss of her son and grandson-- advertises across the country for a new heir thus bringing the promise of wealth to impoverished Londoner Joanna Tremaine, who hopes her ten-year-old son Gerald will be the child chosen to inherit the Tremaine title and fortune. However, just as Joanna settles her family into a luxurious life, a new discovery threatens to destroy her newfound happiness: Little Sir Nicholas has been found alive and well in a small coastal French village. As Nicholas struggles to adjust to life back in England, feelings of rivalry, bitterness, resentment and anger quickly emerge on the return of the little boy. And just how far will Joanna go to ensure Gerald retains his new title...?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338490</url></doc>
