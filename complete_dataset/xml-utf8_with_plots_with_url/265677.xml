<plot>Gauri lives in a small village in India with her crippled ex-army-man &amp; freedom fighter dad, Laxmandas, and a younger brother, Gulab, and makes a living working as a laborer. One day she notices a male lurking around their house, this male subsequently introduces himself as Ranjeet, who has just arrived from Bombay. Ranjeet and Gauri become friends after Ranjeet treats a wound on Gauri's foot, and then both fall in love with each other. Ranjeet starts working for the Government which is in the process of building a dam, where Gauri also works. Ranjeet starts work as a laborer also, but is subsequently promoted as a crane operator. What Gauri and Laxmandas do not know is that Ranjeet is in this village for a reason - greed - for the suitcase of gold that he himself had buried in Gauri's front-yard - the very same gold that he was caught smuggling five years ago - and the very same gold that he had spent five years in prison for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265677</url></doc>
