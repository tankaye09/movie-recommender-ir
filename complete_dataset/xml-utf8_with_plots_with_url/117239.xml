<plot>This film covers the history of books and printing, and the production of a sample (fictional) novel, from the final word of the manuscript to its arrival on the shelves of the shops. It also features brief interviews from figures such as T.S.Eliot and Dame Rebecca West, a robust defence of sensational fiction by "Sapper" of Bulldog Drummond fame, and a lyrical closing statement on the magic and potential of the humble book.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117239</url></doc>
