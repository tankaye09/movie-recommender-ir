<plot>Vincent, a war hero with a haunted past, is driven to gun running, after a government conspiracy gone awry, kills his sister, and leaves him with nothing left in this world, but a crucifix, and the haunted vision of her ghost. When a passenger train, with Vincent's weapons shipment on board, explodes, Vincent suffers a concussion: because he held the bomb detonator, he may or may not have pushed the button. Wounded by confusion and guilt, Vincent flees into a forest, chased by friends, foes, and the skeletons of his past, desperately hoping to discern whether he is a victim of his own dark side, or if he has been pushed into a coupe de grace of destiny, by a murderous maniac with a parasitic hold over the key to his past, and the secret behind the crucifix, forever worn around his neck.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119693</url></doc>
