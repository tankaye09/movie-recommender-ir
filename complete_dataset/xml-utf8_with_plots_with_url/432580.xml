<plot>Toi's Place is a girlie bar in Pattaya, Thailand. It is owned by Toi, a 36-year-old bar girl turned bar girl manager.Through her British husband and his money, Toi is now an established businesswoman. Every night, the tourists flock to the girlie bars and many of them fall in love because the Thai bar girl does not talk about the price at first. The girl is prepared to use not just 10 or 20 minutes, but days, weeks and even months with him. The westerner often gets confused by this and decides to rescue her from what he thinks is a demeaning existence forced upon her by poverty. But is this really the case ? Through the everyday life in Toi's Place, we get the unique Thai version of the oldest trade in the world, which turns out to be very far from the traditional western conception of prostitution.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432580</url></doc>
