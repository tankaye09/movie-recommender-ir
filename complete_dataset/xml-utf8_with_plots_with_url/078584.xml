<plot>It's the Hotel Bonaventure, where urban nightlife blossoms. Claire and Julia just had a few drinks. Tonight marks the end of their business trip and they're just enjoying the last bit of their time in the city of angels. On the way back to their room, they joke about some guy who tried to hit on Claire in the bar. Julia, who had way too many to drink, tries to encourage Claire to "go for it." But Claire simply dismisses the notion. The night grows old and the ladies get ready for bed. Claire finds herself unable to focus on her bedtime routines. Her mind's eye is all on the bathroom, where Julia is showering. The distraction intensifies when she couldn't even take her eyes off Julia who is now putting on lotion. The attraction that has always been there is now beginning to release. Claire knows that this is the night to fulfill her longings. She has been secretly in love with Julia for some time. However, Julia is oblivious to her friend's secret affections. She seems mindful about something else, but avoids explaining about it when Claire asks. Instead she starts packing up. As the packing goes on, Julia stumbles across a document in her bag. Her mood sinks and she collapses on her bed. Claire is alarmed. Julia reveals to Claire that the document is actually divorce papers, and she's just received them not long ago. She tried to talk to her husband Dan, but he refuses to see her. Julia then starts breaking down. Claire goes over to her and tries to give her a friendly hug. Suddenly, Julia clings on to Claire for support. Now, Claire is surprised, delighted, but also struggling. The unexpected physical intimacy becomes a great dilemma for Claire. She could either choose to use Julia's vulnerability and try to advance their relationship or keep the status quo and stay friends. In the end, although it will cost her a deep emotional wound, she decides that it's best to be Julia's friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078584</url></doc>
