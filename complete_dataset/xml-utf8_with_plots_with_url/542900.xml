<plot>The Converter is a large cylindrical vessel into which the molten iron is poured, when the converter is turned into a vertical position and atmospheric pressure forced into the iron by large blowing engines, located in another part of the building. This eliminates the impurities from the crude iron, and resembles myriads of stars coming from the converter. The smoke effect in this picture is, without doubt, the finest ever made on a picture. An interesting and realistic subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542900</url></doc>
