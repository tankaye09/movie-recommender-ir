<plot>The Aphrikan is a psychological horror story exploring empathy, race, and identity. A plastic surgery staff finds themselves caught in a nightmare when one of them locks an injured transient out. The film centers around an egotistical Dr. Hill, who experiments making ethnic patients look "whiter". He is assisted by a young black apprentice, Stephen, whom he browbeats and bosses around. Dr. Hill also uses his office as his personal motel, carrying on an affair with his nurse Anna. One night, a famous patient arrives for a last minute surgery, and she is thrust into the strange and surreal world of Dr. Hill's practice. During her procedure, an injured transient starts beating at the door, needing help. Anna, in a cold state of apathy, locks the man out, and resumes the surgery. Little does she know that she has just unleashed a chain of events that will alter all of their lives irrevocably. Dr. Hill learns the greatest lesson of all, that his perception of reality can be snatched from him in the blink of an eye. He learns, "To move forward, you must look back".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540503</url></doc>
