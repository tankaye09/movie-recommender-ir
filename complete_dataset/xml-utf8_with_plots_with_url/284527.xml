<plot>Influenced by such films as Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and Ron Fricke's Baraka (1992), Kaishi utilizes the technique of time-lapse photography to convey both motion and emotion. Of grand scenery and of gentle subtly. An original film unlike any other, Kaishi allows for each individual to draw his or her own conclusion as to the true definition and meaning of the film. As mesmerizing as it is deep in meaning, Kaishi: Gaia's Requiem reminds us that some things in life are just too beautiful for words.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284527</url></doc>
