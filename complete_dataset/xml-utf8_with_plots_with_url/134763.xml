<plot>Two close and devout Muslim youth, Javed and Akhtar, are childhood pals. They both unknowingly fall in love with the same woman, Firdaus. Since Akhtar is wealthy, and comes from a noble family, the girl's dad, Nawab Mirza, decides that she should marry Akhtar. She is reluctant to do so, but finally agrees when she is threatened. Akhtar has not yet seen Firdaus, but finds out that Javed also loves her, and he decides to marry her, and promptly divorce her by saying "Talaq" three times, so that Javed can marry her later. Javed is delighted with this idea and goes along with it, not knowing that Firdaus is Akhtar's dreamgirl, and he may not be able to keep his word and divorce her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134763</url></doc>
