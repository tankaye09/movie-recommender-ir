<plot>A JOURNEY TO IRAQ is a unique documentary, showing a side of the War on Terror that is rarely seen in mainstream media. This documentary gets up close and personal with Iraqi refugees who fled the country due to religious persecution, and faithful Christians answering God's call to help spread Christianity to the Arab and Kurdish people, and one Missionary struggling to establish what could be the most important print shop in the Middle East. But establishing the first Christian printing press in the Kurdish territory of Northern Iraq is more than difficult - it's almost unthinkable. But Missionary Tim Comer discovers that in the word's newest Republic, the power of Islam leaves little room for Christian Missions, and the only way to get things done is God's way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011882</url></doc>
