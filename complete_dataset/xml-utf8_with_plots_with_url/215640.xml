<plot>An English-speaking woman, who's off camera, talks about what it means to be an Armenian, even though she's never been there. On camera, images move rapidly, often looking as if a strip of film is being pulled quickly through the projector. Multiple images appear as well. The images are from Armenia: old churches, landscapes, faces, buildings, art, people. She recites a string of place names. When the narrator is silent, Armenian music plays. How does one explore one's cultural heritage from afar?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215640</url></doc>
