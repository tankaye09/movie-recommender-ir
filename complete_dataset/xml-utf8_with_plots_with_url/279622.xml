<plot>Mind, Body &amp; Soul Sessions features R&amp;B phenomena Joss Stone live in concert in 2004. Recorded at New York's Irving Plaza, the show begins with an introduction by the legendary Betty Wright, who co-produced the Brit's stunning debut, The Soul Sessions, and co-wrote several songs on the second, Mind, Body &amp; Soul. The barefoot singer then gets down to business, performing a solid selection of material from both albums, including "Super Duper Love" from the first and "You Had Me" from the follow-up. Stone receives strong support from a tight band, distinguished by powerful drummer Caesar Griffin. As a performer, she's vivacious and her soulful voice is in fine form, but she may want to tone down the giggles in the years to come. That said, Stone is still just a teenager--as hard as that may be to believe while listening to the sophisticated recordings of this old soul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279622</url></doc>
