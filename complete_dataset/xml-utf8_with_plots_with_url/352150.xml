<plot>It's the Fourth of July and Mr. Magoo is ready to kick it off safely and sanely forbidding Waldo to set off any firecrackers. Instead, he opts to celebrate by planting flowers in his garden. Unfortunately, he goes to a fireworks stand instead of a flower stand and purchases some fireworks thinking them to be flowers. He even plants them in his garden, no less! Of course, they are eventually set off with a series of explosions, Waldo panicking the whole time. After the fiasco, Magoo decides to soothe Waldo's panic by letting him set off one firecracker after which Waldo is sent to a jail by a policeman who accuses him of starting the fireworks catastrophe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352150</url></doc>
