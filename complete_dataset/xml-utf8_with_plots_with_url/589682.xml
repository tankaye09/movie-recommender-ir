One day, he stumbled upon an unconscious girl lying half naked in the gutter. Scared and uncertain, he picked the girl up and carried her home. He mixed together herbal remedies and nursed the poor woman back to health. He placed her in a bathtub and cleaned the dirt from her face and body. He earned her trust with simple and gentle actions. He saw her as beautiful but dare not say anything. To her, he was a sad little man. Odd to live alone and surrounded by so many plants. On the last day of her human life, she coughed violently, and a small twig emerged from her throat. The Man touched it.
