<plot>DAMAGE DONE is the story of a man whose inability to deal with the losses of his past leads him into a desperate attempt to save a woman whose life is out of control. When Elliot comes to the aid of a beautiful hitchhiker named Andrea while traveling on the open road, he is drawn into a world of drugs and deceit his quiet Middle American background could never have prepared him to understand. As a relationship develops between the two loners, Elliot becomes convinced that he can give Andrea a good life that will lift her up from the throes of heroin abuse and criminal activity. But it is the deep wounds of his own past that prove to be the greatest obstacles in his quest to save his damaged love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?124957</url></doc>
