<plot>In Lepoglava, one of the most notorious penitentiaries in Europe, many regimes have trained their strictness by imposing the brutal methods of the so-called prison rehabilitation.

This is the story about those of them who would today, were Shakespeare alive, be the heroes of his plays.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516117</url></doc>
