<plot>Wealthy railroad owner J.D. Forbes returns home from World War I to find his daughters, Elinor and Marjory, living the wild life of flappers. His wife is unable to control them so he must try to instill discipline. His attempts to curb their behavior pushes them away. The girls leave home and move to the big city. They try every vice the city has to offer from smoking to drinking during Prohibition. Marjory gets married and Elinor gambles. They soon learn that being rebellious is not quite as glamorous as it looks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445568</url></doc>
