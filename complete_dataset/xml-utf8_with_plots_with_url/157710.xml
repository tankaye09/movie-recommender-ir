<plot>A movie double who dreams of being a star takes a punch in a saloon scene, is knocked out, and loses a tooth. At the dentist's, he's given nitrous oxide and, while the dentist and assistant work, our star in the making dreams various scenes in which he plays opposite doubles for Deanna Durbin, Buddy Hackett, Mae West, Zazu Pitts, Charles Laughton, Joe E. Brown, and others. While asleep in the dentist's chair, the double imagines scenes in a king's garden, on board the Bounty, and in Hawaii. Surrounded by doubles, he gets to show off his chops - singing and dancing. By the time the dentist is done, the double is ready for his close up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?157710</url></doc>
