<plot>The first part of this film shows Sir Thomas Lipton receiving guests at the shipbuilding yards of Messrs. Denny &amp; Bros., including Mr. Fife and George L. Watson, the designer of the "Shamrock," and Countess Shaftesbury, who christened the yacht. The second part shows the cup challenger sliding down the ways and into the water. Her beautiful and graceful lines can be seen to advantage in this picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321341</url></doc>
