<plot>Hans meets his best girl in the park, but is deserted in favor of a gaily uniformed soldier. Hans decides if the uniform is so effective he will get one, and in the second scene he is shown in a costume shop where he hires a complete outfit. After arraying himself in the outfit (uniform), which is about as ill-fitting and ridiculous as can be imagined, Hans goes back to the park. The girl is enraptured at his brave appearance, but unfortunately just at that moment a detachment of real soldiers happens along and seeing him off duty in a uniform, arrest Hans as a deserter and carry him off to a camp. In the last scene poor Hans is seen locked in the stocks, where he is being teased and tormented by the soldiers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545053</url></doc>
