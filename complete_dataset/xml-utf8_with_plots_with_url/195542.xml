<plot>This film shows the great fire at 13th and Ridge Ave., Philadelphia, where inside of one hour $500,000 worth of property was consumed. We were on this scene some fifteen minutes after the fire broke out and have consequently produced this great conflagration just as it appeared. A most interesting part of this film is where a fireman clambers up on the wall and fastens a rope thereto. He then descends to the street and joins a number of firemen, who finally pull down the immense pile of bricks, scattering dust and dirt for yards around. All this and more is in plain view of the audience. This is the most realistic fire scene yet made, having been taken from the actual scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195542</url></doc>
