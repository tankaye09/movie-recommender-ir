<plot>"You're in there for a couple of minutes maybe. But in your head it goes on for hours, you see? Sometimes you just can't get enough of it...and then... you always want to be like this." A camera team accompanies two young and reckless cross-country skiers. The whole winter they are on the search for their perfect tracks, traveling through the alps in a run-down bus. In the end they'll have found out about what it means to dedicate everything to a single cause, how to treat their souls faithfully and how long you can survive on canned tomatoes and instant hot chocolate. Someone called it: "The mother of all narcistic and superfluous outdoor-films." There's deep wisdom in these words. Others say it's just a parody. And it's about skiing. In a way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615132</url></doc>
