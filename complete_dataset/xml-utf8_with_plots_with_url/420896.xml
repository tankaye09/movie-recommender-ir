<plot>The British, circa their rule in Asia, have been asked to crush all opposition in the region and have been promised all the men and fire-power necessary. One of the strongest opposition to their rule is a Pathan by the name of Palay Khan, who is seemingly indestructible, and has been responsible for countless British casualties. All plans to capture him have proved to be futile. Then one day, the British do succeed in capturing his close friend, Amar Singh, hold him captive, torture him so that he can reveal Palay's hideout. But Amar Singh refuses to do so, and in retaliation, Palay and his men abduct the daughter, Helen, of British General Bonz and decide to hold her captive until her father arranges the release of Amar Singh. Watch what transpires when Palay and Helen fall in love with each other, and must deal with strong opposition on both Palay's and General Bonz's sides - with Amar Singh's life hanging in the balance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420896</url></doc>
