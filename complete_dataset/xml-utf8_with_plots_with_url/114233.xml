<plot>On January 6th, 2007 the temperature was a balmy 74ยบ in NYC. The heat wave was anything but normal for the dead of winter in NYC. On that day, TodotheShellfish gave me a call, we talked things over and decided to create an art project with recycling in mind. In February, we met with an art gallery located at 451 Grand St. in Brooklyn, the gallery loved the idea, but wanted nothing to do with the project so instead of using it's name on the invitation that was sent to artists. Before we started painting we needed a canvas. I went out dumpster diving one night early that February, and found the majority of the wood that would become the wall, mostly it was in the form of a discarded dresser and a number of mis-cut pieces of plywood. Friend and collaborator Superk8 found the majority paint in the basement of her Manhattan apartment. With the field set, we brought in the artists. For 12 days in February 19 artists cycled through the space leaving their mark on the wall, which would be repainted only hours later.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114233</url></doc>
