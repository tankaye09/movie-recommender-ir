<plot>Lithia is a beautiful typical woman on the outside, or is she? Living a normal life of as a human, she is confronted at the alter on her wedding day by her groom, Vincent, who she now discovers, is also vampire - but from the "enemy" coven who started a war 300 years ago, killed Lithia's parents (the king and queen), and overthrowing her ancient coven's peaceful kingdom. Now, as she stands across the alter about to make her decision, she is rescued by Lancaster, a vampire from her own coven; a steward and bodyguard from her father's ancient kingdom. She learns of Lancaster's oath to her father before he died in the war, to watch over and protect her in secret and in silence - never revealing himself to her until now, on her wedding day. An oath he has been keeping for 300 years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598169</url></doc>
