<plot>A woman dies every half hour in child birth in Afghanistan. In April 2007, IRIN Films returned to Afghanistan to report on the plight of Afghan women nearly six years after the overthrow of the Taliban regime by international forces. Despite notable achievements in the education sector and representation of women in Afghanistan's parliament, women still endure chronically high rates of infant and maternal mortality, growing insecurity and horrific levels of domestic violence. Shot largely in the remote northwestern province of Badakhshan, Losing Hope opens a window onto the lives of Afghan women. Served by few roads and even fewer health centers, expectant women here face a greater chance of losing their lives in childbirth than in any other country in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343409</url></doc>
