<plot>Making friends is not always easy when you're young. Finding friends may be particularly challenging if you are a Christian and want friends who live by Bible standards. This video has therefore been produced to help you learn how to make friends - the right kind of friends! In the style of the long-running Awake!* magazine series "Young People Ask...," this program features candid interviews with youths from the United States, Italy, France, and Spain. It offers practical, Bible-based answers to such questions as: What are some roadblocks to friendship? What are some of the dangers of bad association? What is the most important friendship one could have? A highlight of this program is a true-to-life contemporary drama - a story that echoes the Bible account of Dinah.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667169</url></doc>
