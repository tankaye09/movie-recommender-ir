<plot>Rob (Bob Brindley) and Paul (Dan Renzi) have been having an on-going affair. On New Years Eve, Rob comes home to a message from Paul saying that he wants to stop by on his way home from work. Rob decides to forgo plans with friends to go out for the evening. Instead, he prepares for the arrival of his lover by picking up his place and getting ready. Paul arrives at Rob's and the pair have a quick sexual encounter. Paul has to leave because he and his boyfriend Tony (Samuel Child) are having friends over for a New Year's party. While Paul enjoys the party, Rob is at home still in bed alone contemplating his future or apparent lack of a future with Paul. Based on the short story by Jim McDonough, originally published in the anthology Quickies, Waiting for the Ball to Drop provides a brief glimpse into the complexities of gay male relationships in San Francisco.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645983</url></doc>
