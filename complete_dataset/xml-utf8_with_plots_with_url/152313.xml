<plot>Angel, a former child star, is at breaking point. She is trapped by the Record Company that has manufactured both her records and her identity. Tired of living a lie, she calls Mark, a Record Company Executive, to her City Centre Apartment to persuade him to support her latest album. She wants the world to see who she really is. He can only see the bottom line and is not convinced that her new, more open and honest style will sell. But Angel understands the system equally well. She knows there is one, guaranteed way to ensure that her album is released. Her own, tragic death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152313</url></doc>
