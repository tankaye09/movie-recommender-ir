<plot>Ansuya was made and released by director C. Pulliah as a double bill with Dhruva (1936). It is two mythologicals made exclusively with children and tells the stories of Sati Ansuya and Bhakta Dhruva. In the former Sati Ansuya narrates her story to Seeta during Rama's banishment. Her chastity is questioned by the gods, but her devotion to her husband gives her the power to transform the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh into children and to stop the sun from rising for seven days.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038689</url></doc>
