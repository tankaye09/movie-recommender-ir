<plot>In the spring of 1967 Rangel Vulchanov and Dimo Kolarov, his faithful D.O.P., are on the "Pliska", a merchant vessel, on her journey around Europe and back. The film is not a piece of reporting; rather, it is a fragmentary poetic observation with the director's comment in voice over - it is more on his iwn reactions and associations than a documentary picture. Journeying via Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, London, and Paris, they encounter exotic civilizations, dead cities and modern young people in love. A curious camera, ironic to the star's vanity in Cannes, is, at the same time, respectful when unexpectedly meeting Pier Paolo Pasolini and his crew in the African desert. The moment of the changing of the guards outside Buckingham Palace known from "The Unknown Soldier's Patent Leather Shoes" is also there to be seen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425875</url></doc>
