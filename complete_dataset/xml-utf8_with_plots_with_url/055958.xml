<plot>Tim, a pot-loving Rastafarian, is dodging his landlord's demands for rent when he discovers the body of a dead police officer lying in his backyard. To keep the marijuana crop growing in his garden out of the hands of the police, Tim must dispose of the body himself. He tries to bury the body in his garden, but he hits a water main, soaking the dead officer; he tries to grind the body up in his garbage disposal but it just will not fit; and he tries to burn the body with gasoline but his landlord catches him before he can set the body ablaze. Stunned by the body lying at the feet of her tenant, Tim's landlord drops her cigarette in a pool of gas, blowing Tim up with the dead police officer, and now she must dispose of both bodies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055958</url></doc>
