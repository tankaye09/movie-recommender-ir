<plot>To the delight of his wife Charmaine, Pierre gets a job as a bath chair man, wheeling gout-ridden old folks from their hotel rooms to the salubrious spa. She's happy because she can don her best hat and meet her lover. However, Pierre and the lovers cross paths, and he gives chase, while pushing the occupied bath chair. Through the town they run; the lovers leap onto a train, with Pierre running alongside (chair in tow). The lovers disembark and run into a building, up several flights of stairs, and try to escape across the roof. The bath chair man, chair and all, stays in pursuit. Will the cuckold catch the culprits? And what about the guy with gout?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542192</url></doc>
