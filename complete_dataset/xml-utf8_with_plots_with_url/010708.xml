<plot>If you want a good laugh, see this film. Two [black men] are seated on a bench and one is relating a "funny story" to the other, and they enjoy it mutually. The story teller, however, emphasizes his remarks with his fist on the anatomy of his listener, and judging from the wry faces he makes the story teller's punches and jabs in the stomach of his companion leave the lasting impression. The more interesting the story becomes the more he thumps his companion, until patience ceases to be a virtue and he grasps the story teller by the throat and almost chokes him before he can explain that "it was only a joke." This picture is not alone extremely funny, but the photography is perfect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010708</url></doc>
