<plot>"A farmer and his daughter have rowed to Pleasure Bay with some produce, when they are sighted as fair marks by a couple of mischievous small boys who proceed to pelt them with tomatoes. Enraged, the farmer attempts to hit one of the boys with his umbrella, but as he does so he loses his balance and overturns the boat. Both he and his daughter are floundering in the water in an instant."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556935</url></doc>
