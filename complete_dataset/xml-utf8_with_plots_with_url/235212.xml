<plot>Based on Rennie Cowan's novel "Hellscape", a young teenage boy named Joel Montgomery relives surreal dreams called green dreams every night when he is asleep in his bed. His mother is a drunk and lacks sensitivity to her son, Joel. Troubled by his upbringing and the green dreams, he finally meets the adversary that has been haunting him: Bee Boe, an evil Clown from Hell. The truth about Bee Boe takes Joel for a spin as he discovers that his life really isn't his own. He has been reliving the life of a troubled teenager from the past, a teenager named Hank; and reliving Hank's dysfunctional family life and hidden legacy, inside the green dreams, a curse that not too many teenagers wake up from.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235212</url></doc>
