<plot>April 1994, on a quiet road in Kigali a group of neighbors was filmed. But this was the opening days of the Rwandan Genocide. This documentary re-visits the scene following the cameraman, victims, survivors, killers and witnesses. But all they were unaware that they were filmed, that this moment unlike a dream can be replayed, each character watches the footage, each has a very different interest and emotion. From the original footage the story follows a thread of revelation, so many souls lost in the mist of ethnic hatred, they came together for one terrible hour on a quiet road.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269048</url></doc>
