<plot>Welcome to WeHo Manor and its residents: Handsome hunks, good doctors, evil twins, nude maids, cross dressing nuns engaging in life's simple pleasures like love triangles, kidnapping, blackmail and a whole lot more!! They are fabulously sick, twisted and bitchy, bitchy, bitchy. Doug Stevenson the "selfless clinic volunteer"/quasi professional gossip columnist is actually a brown nosing, ladder climbing egomaniac. Tony Rios the popular soap actor with a porno past. The eccentric apartment manager who likes his maids hunky, Latin and nude. Juan, the nude maid is anticipating a bitter catfight with his soon to be ex lover, Vic, the lazy handyman at the complex. Young and out Chance Carnagie has just been tossed out by his ultra right wing father and is befriended by a pair of homeless teens, Liza and Elvis. Semi closeted conservative and unethical lawyer Trevor Turner learns that the only people getting promoted at his firm are married with children. Dr. Jerry, the rock of the neighborhood doesn't know that his lover Ernie is a recovering drug addict.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650849</url></doc>
