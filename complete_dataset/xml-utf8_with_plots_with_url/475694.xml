<plot>This mythological features tales from the Ramayana. The film later acquired curiosity values for its primitive technique: workers from the Godavari canals were recruited to play Rama's (Kadaru Raju) monkey brigade; a train comes into a shot of Rama, Seeta and Lakshmana during their exile in the forest. It depicts the life of Rama, Seeta and Laksmana while they are exiled in the forest for 14 years. Seeta gets kidnapped by Ravana and is taken to Lanka. Rama and Lakshmana with the aid of Hanuman and his monkey army go after her to rescue her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475694</url></doc>
