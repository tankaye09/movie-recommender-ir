<plot>Aperitif is a topical dark comedy that stretches the boundaries of the bizarre to the just plain ridiculous. The year is 2004. The government from every country on Planet Earth has banned the consumption of meat. Scientists have been able to prove that meat eaters have homicidal instincts and these instincts come directly from the eating of meat. By law it is no longer legal to eat or to store meat. Those found in possession of meat are placed under arrest and re-educated in the ways of vegetarianism. The meat selling business is now underground, run by gangsters and unemployed farmers. However, several underground factions have now turned to a new source of meat to feed their undying lust for flesh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363054</url></doc>
