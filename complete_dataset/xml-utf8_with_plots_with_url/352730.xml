<plot>The Personal Concubine 2000 is a state of the art love doll that programs itself by watching x-rated movies. Steve is a lonely computer programmer who's been emotionally scarred by a series of bad relationships. After watching a late-night infomercial he is easily persuaded to purchase a PC-2000 in an effort to end his recent streak of loneliness. Steve's dreams of companionship are temporarily shattered when his new doll appears to be nothing more than a stitched-together corpse. Horrified at first, rather than spend another minute alone, Steve decides to keep her and attempt to make the most out of the situation. Steve quickly learns the PC-2000 is capable of learning more than just intimate acts and matters take a turn for the worse after the doll is accidentally exposed to an all-night horror movie marathon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352730</url></doc>
