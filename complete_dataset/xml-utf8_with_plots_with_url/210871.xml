<plot>In 1985, there were three gays who were out of the closet in Israel. By 1998, there were 3,000. In this short, intensive and dramatic period, Israel came out of the closet in one of the quickest and most colorful revolutions of the end of the 20th century. There was no bloodshed in this revolution, but a rare cooperation between academics, prostitutes, transsexuals, singers, hairdressers and military officers. The director, Yair Qedar, documented this revolution in he's newspaper, The Pink Times. Using rare archival materials, personal stories and touching scenes, and via his own personal diary, the film tells the untold story of the GLBT revolution in Israel in an energetic, bittersweet musical collage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210871</url></doc>
