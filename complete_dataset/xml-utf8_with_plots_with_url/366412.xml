<plot>Merger is a fast-paced mainstream feature film based on the novel MERGER, by Sanjay Sanghoee. A high-stakes thriller, the movie is set in the world of high finance, media conglomerates and defense companies. A timely and compelling story, Merger takes the audience behind the closed doors of Wall Street and Capitol Hill to expose the shocking connection between corporate crime and national security, the dangers of global trade, and the lengths to which a megalomaniacal businessman will go to gain power and control.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366412</url></doc>
