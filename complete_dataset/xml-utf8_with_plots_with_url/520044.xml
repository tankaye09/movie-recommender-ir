<plot>Into a dollar-a-day room in a Bowery hotel enters a New York drummer who has evidently been having a "good time." As soon as he is left alone he begins to "see things." His valise flies around the room in a startling manner, and upon opening it a huge demon's head arises therefrom and floats through the air. A bottle on the table changes into a little black dog, which springs to the floor as he reaches to take a drink; he rings for the chambermaid, but immediately kicks her out. She returns reinforced with the landlord and the bell-boy. All four now engage in a most furious fight, in which bed-clothes, chairs, water pitcher, etc., taken an active part. The drummer wraps a towel around his head, and pouring the contents of the ice water pitcher upon it, wearily lies down again. After seeing the picture it is easy to see what we give it the title "Such a Headache."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520044</url></doc>
