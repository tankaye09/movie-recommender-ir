<plot>Popeye and Olive are on a safari, he with a gun and she with a camera. She wanders off to stalk a chimp, and happens across Bluto as a Tarzan-like character. She's smitten, as is he, so he shows off a bit. Popeye finally catches on, and they start the usual round of fighting and one-upmanship. Bluto summons a wide array of animals, and while Popeye's occupied, hauls Olive high into a treehouse. With some help from the chimp, Popeye has his spinach and turns most of the animals into fur coats (on a rack the chimp pushes through the melee), then rescues Olive by hauling on the tree's roots until she's at ground level.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473521</url></doc>
