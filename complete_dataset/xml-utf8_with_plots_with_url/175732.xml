<plot>An inventor builds an unlikely personal space transportation vehicle at home in his garage. The vehicle is named the OSULRC-1 which stands for the "Outer Space Ultra Light Rocking Chair" (v1.0) He flies the contraption with his brain and secures it with his heart. His name is Elliot Wilcox. Elliot is hired by the Fortune 500 to bring back data from space for business research and development. Along the way he is asked to perform a small task for the United States Air Force (much to his wife's disapproval). The success of this mission leads to an adventure of cat and mouse between Elliot and Commander Silk of the United States Air Force. Commander Silk seeks to separate Elliot from his latest invention, the OSULRC-1.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175732</url></doc>
