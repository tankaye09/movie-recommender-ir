<plot>Before CNN, cam-corders, and communications satellites, the only way to view exotic locales was on real film that might take weeks or months to arrive from the far corners of the world. The raison d'etre for this program was to bring that film to the television viewer. Each week some adventurer would be asked to narrate his 16 mm home movies for the viewing audience. The film might be from the Amazon jungle or the arctic regions of northern Alaska. Teenage boys were drawn to the show not only by the adventure but also by the occasional fleeting glimpse of some native woman's bare breast.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078108</url></doc>
