<plot>Dindayal lives a poor lifestyle in Bombay along with his wife, Shanti, and is employed with Dinanath. One day while at a reception, Dinanath's associate, Sunderdas, gets killed. Before dying he accuses Dindayal of killing him, as a result Dindayal is arrested, prosecuted in Court by Shakuntala Devi, found guilty, and sentenced to prison for life. Shanti gives birth to two sons, but loses her mental capabilities and is institutionalized. 18 years later Dindayal gets discharged, he takes a gun, locates Shakuntala, who has recently been appointed Judge, and confronts her. He then kills himself, but before dying asks Shakuntala to avenge his death by locating the real killer(s). Shakuntala hides his death from everyone, finds out that Dindayal has a look alike son, Shera, and recruits him to track down three possible suspects, namely Radheyshyam Pundit, Nissar Khan, and Peter. Shera agrees to do so for a fee, but he is attacked by the trio, decides to not to have to do anything with this matter and even states that he is not Dindayal's son, and neither is his mother's name Shanti, but Durga Devi. Neither Shakuntala nor Shera know that the person who masterminded Sunderdas' death is not amongst the trio, and that this person will soon enter their lives - shattering their peace and changing their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317510</url></doc>
