<plot>'White Lies and Roses' - set in London and Cannes - is about a desperate, out-of-work English actor called ART FORM (real name - Arthur Formbey), who pretends to be a major Hollywood producer in order to win the heart of a beautiful and rich aristocratic girl - ANNABELLE. Art's life becomes even more complicated after he meets Annabelle's father, the EARL OF CLOTWORTHY, who decides to invest in Art's next movie project, which, in reality, doesn't exist! What follows is a nightmarish race against time as Art (playing three different characters!) rushes around the Cannes Film Festival, desperately trying to get a major Hollywood movie off the ground (before the festival ends) in order to convince Annabelle, and her father, that he really is who he says he is. Of course, as you can imagine, everything goes horribly wrong.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654631</url></doc>
