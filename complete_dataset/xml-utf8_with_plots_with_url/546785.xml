<plot>One of the most distinct novelties in life motion pictures is that of the busy bee at work. Here we show the industry of the little fellows from the time they gather the honey from the flowers until it is ready for the market. It is a picture to interest young and old, and makes a good feature film for any show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546785</url></doc>
