<plot>A computer programmer courts a woman who wants a break from the aggressive men she gets into relationships with. Once she has the 'geek' she quickly tires of his persistent sweetness and constant affections. She insults his lifestyle and convinces him to live a more hedonistic life. In an effort to please her he changes his life to become more 'exciting'. As a result of his change he becomes more like the aggressive men she normally sees. Their relationship falls apart as does he, unable to cope with the pressures on his insecure character.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648632</url></doc>
