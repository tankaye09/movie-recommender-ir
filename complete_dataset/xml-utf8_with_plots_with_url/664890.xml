<plot>Au-jin is a mother of two children and wife to a husband in deep financial difficulties. To augment her income, she works for a telephone sex-chat service. After a chance meeting with Madam Kim, she is offered a job in an all-night bar acting as a companion for lonely men. She is uncomfortable as the level of services she must provide increases, until one day she is introduced to a customer who appears to treat her affectionately and lovingly. Could he be the one for her, the one to take her away from all this?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664890</url></doc>
