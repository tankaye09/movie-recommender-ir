<plot>The Nu River is one of the last free-flowing rivers in China and Asia, but about two years ago, the Chinese government proposed 13 dams over the Nu River. China needs enormous hydroelectric power to keep up with its soaring economic growth. However, nobody builds dams like China. For the past 50 years, the country has already built over 86,000 dams. Among those, more than 22,000 are big dams that account for almost 50% of its kind in the world. As plans of damming the Nu River continue, the anger against the dams among Chinese environmentalists is growing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125125</url></doc>
