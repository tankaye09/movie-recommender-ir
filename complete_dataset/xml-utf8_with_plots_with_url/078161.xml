<plot>A Macedonian filmmaker wants to make the first official Balkan Dogma film in Macedonia. She lies to her friends that she got financial support from the Zentropa producers. The film starts from the moment that she gathers her closest friends and asks them to join her in the quest for finding the right story for the film. She has decided to film the whole process from the very beginning and use it later for the making off. Following the four characters in their quest we discover Macedonia and the Balkans in 2006. The camera captures visual sequences of the absurdity, humor and survival techniques of a land and people in transition. The making off project ultimately becomes the true subject of the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078161</url></doc>
