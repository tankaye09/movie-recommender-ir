<plot>Mike is a big thirty year old lug who didn't want to grow up. He worked as an EMS technician but his free time was spent as a hockey nut and hanging out with scruffy slacker Weasel in the small house they shared in New Haven, Connecticut. Mike got a big slap upside the head when his friend Jimmy, known for his short relationships, decided to marry soul mate Marcia and invited Mike to be his best man. Realizing his own life was going nowhere, Mike tried to rekindle his relationship with perky ex-girlfriend Shawna who was getting her second degree at Yale.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576484</url></doc>
