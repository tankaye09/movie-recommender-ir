<plot>In utero during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Chris Highland grew up obsessed with the prospect of nuclear annihilation. After spending years studying the conflicts that led up to the Cold War, Chris accompanied Russian troops to Chechnya as a photographer while the Cold War was grinding to an agonizing conclusion. Shot by Chechen Rebels while on his journey, Chris narrowly escaped with his life and returned to the United States. During recovery he experienced an epiphany, the conflict he had been chasing all these years was inside him. Deconfliction delves into the mind of an individual struggling to make peace with his conflicted gender identity; a conflict that Chris believes may have been caused by the Cold War itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134661</url></doc>
