<plot>A small-town Texan raises an army of 30,000 tribesmen for the C.I.A. in Southeast Asia and fights an innovative, successful war ... for a while. Forty years later, Bill Lair is back home in Texas, with strong ideas on how the U.S. government should (and should not) be fighting wars overseas with the help of indigenous people. Meanwhile, 200,000 Hmong tribes people from Laos have come to the U.S., as a direct result of Bill Lair's C.I.A. operation, and they have a few things to say to him about changing their destinies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411709</url></doc>
