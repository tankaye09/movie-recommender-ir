<plot>After moving out of his parents home, Yoshiji gets an apartment with three other young men. His new roommates are exceptionally free spirits, and Yoshiji initially joins in their antics wholeheartedly. As the summer wears on, however, their behavior, and that of the houseguests they invite in, becomes increasingly bizarre, and Yoshiji finds himself having less in common with them than he thought. He seeks the advice of others, but eventually must make his own decision of what he will be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102819</url></doc>
