<plot>Scene V of the Buster Brown Series. Shows an Italian balloon vendor near the "Flat-iron" Building, New York City. Mrs. Brown and Buster appear on the scene. Buster begins teasing his mamma to buy him a balloon, but she refuses. Buster whistles for Tige, and at the same time jostles the vendor, who roughly brushes him aside. Seeing a chance to get a balloon for nothing, Buster sets Tige upon the Italian, and points towards the balloons. The vendor, in his efforts to get away from the dog, loses his hold on the balloons and they scatter in every direction. Several stray dogs join Tige in rushing upon the balloons, and in their efforts to get hold of them they butt them about in the air in all directions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087707</url></doc>
