<plot>Lionel Lyons (a lion) comes home completely plastered one night. Discovering his wife to be up and angry, he tries to sneak in a window, only to run afoul of his vicious little sun, who threatens to clip off his fingers if he doesn't say he's a nice boy! The majority of the cartoon details Lionel's attempts to get in the house, each one a larger and wackier disaster than the last!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337338</url></doc>
