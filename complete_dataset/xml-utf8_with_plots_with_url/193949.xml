<plot>Taken in India. Two rams, one black and the other white, are seen being held at a given distance apart, and as they are let go, rush toward each other with great force. They back away and come together head to head several times. Twice they do not come straight, and as the heads meet on one side one of them is seen to turn a somersault from the force of the blow. A favorite sport in India.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193949</url></doc>
