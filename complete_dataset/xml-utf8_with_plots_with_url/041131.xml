<plot>Raju lives with his widowed mother, Janki, in a small town and works as garage mechanic. One day he meets with wealthy Rachna Malhotra, and after a few misunderstandings, both fall in love with each other. When Rachna's guardian, Diwan Mahendranath, finds out he forbids Rachna to ever see Raju again, as well as goes to Raju's house and humiliates his mother, for he wants Rachna to marry his son, Ramesh. An enraged Raju wants to avenge this humiliation and decides to teach Mahendranath a lesson. He enlists the help of his maternal uncle, Chamanlal Kapoor, and together they succeed in fooling Mahendranath and making him give up all his money. But at the very last moment, Mahendranath finds out that he has been tricked, and together he and Ramesh conceive a plan that will bring Raju and his mother to their knees - a plan that will change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041131</url></doc>
