<plot>In July of 2001, the artist Hans Freeberling had an art opening in an empty gallery claiming to have 'installed' nothing. Many of the people in attendance came unprepared for the artist's literal inter-pretation of the show's subject matter and responded correspondingly. This film not only chronicles the highly successful opening, but includes commentary by local and international figures in the art community regarding the artist and the merit of his work, as well as insights from the artist himself. Hans Freeberling was a San Francisco based artist at the time of the making of "The Art of Nothing." His work is known in London, Paris, New York and other parts for its unconventional, explorative approach and total commitment to Art for Art's sake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540867</url></doc>
