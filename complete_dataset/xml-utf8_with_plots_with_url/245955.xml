<plot>A burlesque on the popular western diversion. A strapping cowboy comes into the editorial sanctum prepared to administer a thrashing to the editor; but the office boy with a sling-shot, and the scrub lady with her mop get at him first. When they are finished with him, all thoughts of horsewhipping the editor have vanished.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245955</url></doc>
