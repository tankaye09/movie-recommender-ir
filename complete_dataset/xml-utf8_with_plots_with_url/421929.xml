<plot>Kennicott Glacier is rightfully entitled to be called the eighth wonder of the world. When a railroad is built within its vicinity, thousands of tourists will visit it annually. All phases and stages of ice-formation are here shown, and in our view of the Pot Hole we show the birth of the Kennicott River, a wide, rushing, unfordable stream, that springs seemingly from the bowels of the earth at the foot of the Moraine at the end of the glacier.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421929</url></doc>
