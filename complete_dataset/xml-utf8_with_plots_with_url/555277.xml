<plot>This popular mythical legend of the Fatherland is described in full detail, and many startling effects are introduced. A pretty German peasant girl is awaiting her lover at the trysting place in the mountains, when she is captured by the dwarfs and carried to their underground cavern or grotto. Her sweetheart is unable to rescue her until the good fairy presents him with the enchanted cup, with which he is able to penetrate into the depths of the earth and rescue his Gretchen from their clutches. Beautiful scenic effects and novel situations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555277</url></doc>
