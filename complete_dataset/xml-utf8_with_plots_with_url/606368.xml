<plot>Hundreds of millions of people in our world live on less than one dollar a day. The facts and statistics of poverty distress us daily. But what does it mean in human terms to really live in such dire poverty. Through a Child's Eyes presents a true picture of daily life told through the eyes of nine year old children. Moving yet uplifting, human stories of life in poverty told by seven very special children from India, Egypt, New York, Romania, Cambodia, Rwanda and Brazil, who share in earnest their experiences of life in poverty so articulately while retaining their joyous spirit of childhood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606368</url></doc>
