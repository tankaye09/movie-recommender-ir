<plot>A beautiful fox terrier is seen in this picture devouring rats by the score. As fast as he disposes of one, another is fast in his jaws. Some of the rats show fight, one in particular fastening his teeth in one of the hind legs of the dog, but he quickly takes flight and meets his death like all the rest. This picture is full of animation and interesting situations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102811</url></doc>
