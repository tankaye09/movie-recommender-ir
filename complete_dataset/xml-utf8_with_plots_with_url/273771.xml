<plot>The suicide of a bright schoolboy, 17-year-old Hee-Joon, stirs extreme responses from those left behind. This clever, intriguing feature keeps us guessing about the truth behind the flashbacks. It includes a young girl transfixed by taxidermy, a predatory sports teacher who bonds rather too closely with his male students, and a literature teacher with a violent response to poor writing. Then there are members of a family and the leading characters in Hee-Joon's novel. The result is an emotional puzzle with a dark sense of fun. A wayward South Korean gem - at once funny, macabre, and mysterious.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273771</url></doc>
