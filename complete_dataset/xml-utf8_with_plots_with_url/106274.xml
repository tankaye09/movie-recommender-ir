<plot>The life, work and ideas of one of the most important living Brazilian plastic artists, Cildo Meirelles, are shown on screen through his own words. Winner of the 2008 Velazques Award, Cildo goes over with admirable clarity topics as sophisticated and complex as his art installations, discoursing about conceptual art, the differences between expendability and disposability, and the best venue for a work of art when he was preparing for an exhibition of 80 of his works at London's Tate Modern, which was held between October 2008 and January 2009.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106274</url></doc>
