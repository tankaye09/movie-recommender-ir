<plot>A funny picture in the extreme, in which two thieves who are burglarizing a house figure conspicuously. The funny tricks that are played on the two policemen in the backyard of the house defy description. The scene ends by one of the policemen being secured to a dog house by a dog chain and the other one being stuck headforemost in a well while the burglars escape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546671</url></doc>
