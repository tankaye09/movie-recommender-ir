<plot>T.J. Cousins is a mountain man who committed some grisly murders a few years ago. Currently he is in prison. Now a drug dealer also in the same prison hires T.J. to lead him through the Sierras. Now the "High Mountain Rangers" a group who's assigned the task of bringing T.J. and the other escapees back, are on the case but T.J. proves to be too wily for them, and kills one of them. So Matt Hawkes, one of the rangers, decides to get help from the man who caught T.J., his father, Jesse Hawkes. Now it seems that Hawkes felt that T.J. should have been executed but that sentenced was reduced to life imprisonment, so he left the rangers and lives in a cabin up in the mountains. Jesse at first decides not to do it but eventually changes his mind. But as I said T.J. is too wily. And he also wants to get his hands on Hawkes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238866</url></doc>
