<plot>Using general knowledge questions, each contestant bids to answer the question having only heard half. The highest bid answers the question but only gets the points if he gets it right. At the end of each round the leader makes nominates one person to leave, that one person when can beg to be allowed to stay - then the leader can decide to change their mind or stay with their first choice. The game gets down to two people who then play a final round. The twist is that at the end they must decide whether to share the money or not. They both face each other and secretly vote to Share or Shaft - if both vote share then they share the prize, if one shares and one shafts then the 'Shafter' then gets all the money, if they both shaft then no-one gets any money. They then are both given the chance to talk to each other and then re-vote.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490003</url></doc>
