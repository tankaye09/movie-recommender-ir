<plot>Characterized as a "fictionalized documentary" by the producer, this bizarre experimental drama is the story of three days in the life of a highly charged and successful Long Island insurance salesman who takes a filmmaker to Las Vegas. Though the protagonists really are a salesman and a director, the line between reality and fiction is hopelessly blurred as the story unfolds. . . The brash, loud and supremely confidant salesman shmoozes his clients in a way that is a game for him. He uses his powers of persuasion to acquire more and more sales. He and his cronies drink and feast over their success before embarking on the Las Vegas convention. The company even goes so far as to provide women for the married men, rewarding their career successes with amoral excesses in this film that concludes with a dream sequence on a beach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292747</url></doc>
