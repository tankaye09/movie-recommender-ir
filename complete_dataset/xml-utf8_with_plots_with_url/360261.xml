<plot>Chelsea Parker is an artistic teenage student who enrolls to Westmont High School for their graduate program. Westmont guarantees that all students who graduate from their program will have a reserved spot for them in college. Once admitted into the high school, Chelsea quickly discovers that the school isn't as wonderful as they put out to be. Westmont requires that all students wear white masks to hide their identity, to prevent discriminations and gangs on the campus. All students must wear a specified uniform, have their hair worn a certain way, and to not wear any makeup or jewelry; in other words, to look like clones. The classrooms are taught the same by an instructional video teacher. Chelsea struggles to fit into the school's environment, but quickly discovers that Westmont is not the school for her. Westmont shuns the arts and focuses completely on education and admittance into college. Chelsea tries to explain to her mother her situation and how Westmont is not the school for her but Mrs. Parker will not listen. She is determined to make Chelsea a successful woman of society and that means she will have to graduate college. And in order to graduate College, Chelsea will have to stick it out at Westmont. Chelsea is devastated by her mother's lack of understanding and breaks down. She knows that she cannot stay at Westmont but she does not want to disappoint her mom. So Chelsea makes a decision that puts her high school career in jeopardy</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360261</url></doc>
