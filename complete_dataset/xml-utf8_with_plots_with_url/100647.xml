<plot>In 1928, Gus Cannon and Cannon's Jug Stompers began recording and playing songs that would go on to influence some of the biggest acts in rock and roll history. By the mid-1930's they were virtually unheard of. What happened to Gus, and what happened to his music? Chasin' Gus' Ghost is a documentary film on the history of Jug Band Music. It traces the roots of American music beginning with Gus Cannon and Cannon's Jug Stompers, The Memphis Jug Band and the Dixieland Jug Blowers from the 1920's, and weaves a tapestry through interviews, live performances, archival footage, and photographs showing their influence on the ever-popular folk and rock movements of the 1960's and its relevance today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100647</url></doc>
