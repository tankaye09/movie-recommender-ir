<plot>Former prisoners of the German concentration camps "Langenstein" and "Dora", which were built for the war industry factories to produce the V-2 - rocket for the "total war" offensive of 1943/44, return to the sites of their sufferings. Their memories lay bare the barbarity of the "Dora principle", which meant the destruction of prisoners by forced labour. The film presents his subject in an experimental dramaturgy presenting a young foreign woman searching for the roots of the camps and rocket factories, using very special black &amp; white photography following her subjective view and personal experience. Film shots from the hidden underground tunnel systems of the weapon factory of Dora are confronted with the testimonies of former prisoners who survived the Dora system.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?128744</url></doc>
