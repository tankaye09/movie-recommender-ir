<plot>n Place Out of Time is a poetic portrait of a fourth generation New Mexican who sold his backhoe and picked up a camera in pursuit of a photographic quest. Eight years ago, at the age of 65, Embree "Sonny" Hale had a spark of inspiration and started a quixotic journey to take a picture of every petroglyph and pictograph in New Mexico. This film illustrates Hale's day-to-day triumphs, challenges and survival strategies as he pursues his passion to capture and preserve the memory of ancient inscriptions on rock. A true-life Western, In Place Out of Time is set in the stunning landscapes of New Mexico and captures the grit and gumption of a man who follows his heart and pursues his true life's work. Ultimately, this film takes a gentle and multi-layered look at an individual's eternal connection to community, landscape, and memory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262017</url></doc>
