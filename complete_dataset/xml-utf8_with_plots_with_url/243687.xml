<plot>The film begins as a personal journey of filmmaker, Mary Healey, who was also a Catholic. She films a series of historic events where we meet key players involved in the sexual abuse scandal, including victims, whistle-blower priests and a senior ranking US Cardinal who is called upon by the Vatican to control a waxing maelstrom. The film brings the viewer deep within the institutional mind of the Catholic Church: a powerful institution that now promises to rectify the horrors of the abuse it enabled upon thousands of children. This intensely personal and political story investigates a myriad of contributing factors that set in motion the on-going crisis in the Catholic Church. The psychological drama that unfolds before the camera soulfully questions one's deepest assumptions about the forces of good and evil.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243687</url></doc>
