<plot>While in Bethlehem, Joseph begins crafting a letter to his beloved mother and what follows is a loving son's testimony via ink &amp; quill. Joseph admits that upon Mary's return from Judea, he struggled to find the truth behind his fiance's sudden pregnancy. The pain of suspicion and gossip provoked him to end their engagement but when an angelic visit uncovered the truth behind Mary's claim, Joseph was faced with a choice: listen to the whispers of his community or voice his belief in Mary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204959</url></doc>
