<plot>There have always been catastrophes in the world? but never before have there been so many, so frequently! Earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, famine, disease and war? are we simply experiencing the natural order of things? Or are the signs we see all around us the warnings of the end times? And in the 21st century, are science and technology confirming the prophecies of old? Apocalypse and the End Times... is the most comprehensive and compelling compilation of answers to these and other fascinating questions yet assembled. It will challenge your beliefs and perhaps even change the way you see the world... forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043513</url></doc>
