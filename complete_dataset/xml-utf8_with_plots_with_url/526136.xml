<plot>Following the journey of a group of young women as they compete for spots on the 2004 U.S. synchronized swimming team and train relentlessly to win an Olympic medal, Sync or Swim offers a uniquely intimate look at a mocked and misunderstood sport that combines artistic and athletic expression. The film also examines the media storm that threatens the team's Olympic dreams when one of its members suffers devastating injuries and faces manslaughter charges as a result of a tragic car accident. Juxtaposing scenes that are intense and emotional, uplifting and mesmerizing, quirky and entertaining, Sync or Swim is the first-ever behind the scenes documentary about the making of the U.S. Olympic Synchronized Swimming Team.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?526136</url></doc>
