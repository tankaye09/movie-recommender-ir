<plot>After traveling millions of light years in space, a highly advanced bio-engineered bacteria, AlphaOmega, slips undetected into Earth's population. Millions of microscopic parasites invade a human mind, reprogramming the body into a new kind of machine... a Cylon. Battlestar Galactica is the story of the epic battle of Man vs. Machine... and man is losing. In a distant part of the universe, the vicious cybernetic race known as the Cylons have been ruthlessly hunting all human life, devastating the Twelve Colonies of Man. Now, the remaining Colonials desperately search the stars in a race to find Earth. But the Cylons have already found it, and are now far more dangerous than the Colonials ever imagined... and are a far greater threat to all mankind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032697</url></doc>
