<plot>Michael has just woken into his nightmare. For years he has been plagued with psychotic visions of unthinkable medical experiments being performed on him. After a failed attempt at suicide, his mother takes the young boy to a priest for guidance. The strict confines of his faith only add to his unrest, as his psychosis worsens. At eighteen, he drowns himself in his bathtub. He awakes, only to find himself in the hospital of his nightmares. Once he gains enough strength, he struggles to escape. Trying to avoid the doctor and nurse from his dreams, he stumbles upon another patient, brain dead and on a respirator. To his horror, the body appears to be his, down to the scar on his wrist from his first suicide attempt. Michael soon discovers that the body on life support is his own, and that he has awakened in the body of his clone. Desperate and confused, he tries to escape from the labyrinthine hospital, holding out hope that he may just awaken from this terrible dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015221</url></doc>
