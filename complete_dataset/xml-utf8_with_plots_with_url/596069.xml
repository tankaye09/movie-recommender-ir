<plot>The Tim Pipher Show was a "Tonight Show -like" interview program with a large studio audience, a band, celebrities flown in from New York and Los Angeles , and on-set interviews from Hollywood. What made this show special was that the celebrities were major soap opera stars! For the production, the producers renovated an old movie theater on Hilton Head Island, SC , and turned it into what was at the time the largest TV studio in the Carolinas, seating over 300. After its broadcast run, videotapes were sold via advertising in Soap Opera Digest. Tim Pipher was the host. Guests included Billy Warlock of General Hospital, Julie Pinson of Port Charles (now of Days of Our Lives), and Lauren Koslow, Victor Alfieri, Bryan Dattilo, and Steve Wilder of Days of Our Lives. Rob Springer was the announcer and John Bracket was the band leader. John Bracket and the Sounds of Primetime was the band.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596069</url></doc>
