<plot>Trying to protect his private gay life-style and his new business venture from his good-hearted, meddling parent's Grace &amp; John, Randy fights for his independence. When Randy catches his parents making love in his apartment, Randy expresses his discontent. When Randy discovers his business opportunity was promoted by his mother, he is disappointed. Randy just wants his privacy with his business partner/lover Colin, and their life together to be returned to the tranquil time before the parent intervention.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346066</url></doc>
