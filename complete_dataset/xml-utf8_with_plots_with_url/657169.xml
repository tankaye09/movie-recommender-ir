<plot>Randy Sloan is afraid to go to sleep. When he does, he is plagued by nightmares where a man in black tries to kill him. A gifted but blocked composer, Randy is struggling to write a song for his idol, rock star Russ Calvin. When Randy's girlfriend Sara gets him a meeting with Calvin, Randy comes unprepared. Predictably, he is curtly dismissed by Calvin. Outside the recording studio, Sara lets him have it: "You are your own worst enemy!" AND THEN THE REAL NIGHTMARES BEGIN. The Man in Black haunts Randy's dreams, doggedly determined and focused -- everything Randy is not. When Randy literally confronts his nemesis, he gets the surprise of his life. The result: he finally finishes the elusive song, changing Calvin's life as well as his own. This message of believing in one's self and struggling against the odds -- even those we create -- is set to a rousing rock score by Jerry Williams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657169</url></doc>
