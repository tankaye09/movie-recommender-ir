<plot>Our US troops come home from war and take off their uniforms and blend into society. But the war hasn't ended for them. How can we help them transition? Learn what they think, feel and experience during war through interviews backed up with their personal video footage shot in Iraq. If we understand what our troops really think and feel, we can better help them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067048</url></doc>
