<plot>Her boyfriend drops her off in front of the EuroAirport terminal at Basel-Mulhouse. She buys a magazine (with a cover story about Turkey) and a box of heart-shaped cookies, then sits in the waiting room, her bag and box of cookies on the small, low table next to her. She notices that the man seated at the other side of the table has helped himself to a cookie. She keeps reading and eating cookies, and he keeps eating as well. Soon, they are in a face off, crunching one cookie after another. She's moved her bag out of his reach and gives him dirty looks, which he returns playfully. She leaves in a huff, to her gate, where she makes a discovery that crumbles her sang-froid.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550163</url></doc>
