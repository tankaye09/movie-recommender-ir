<plot>Vignette #1: "Hamlet, Interrupted" -As Dr. Hawkins, on the phone, talks Sylvia Plath down off the proverbial cliff, Hamlet and Ophelia enter with a host of premarital issues to work through. Hamlet refuses to speak in anything but iambic pentameter, while Ophelia tries to work through the various in-law problems with Dr. Hawkins. Can this wedding be saved? Possibly, if Hamlet's dosage of Prozac is upped. Vignette #2: "Alice in Therapy" -While Alice talks to the tea cup, the mirror, and the rabbit figurine, Dr. Hawkins tries to convince her to just sit down and realize that she is in a safe space. A safe space that, unfortunately, is violated by Hamlet and Laertes, who are trying to work out their problems with swords. Vignette #3: "Villains, Anonymous" -After attempting to join the heroes' group and feeling horribly out of place, Hamlet seeks solace with the villains. But will the likes of the Wicked Witch and Captain Hook accept a waffler like Hamlet?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?116576</url></doc>
