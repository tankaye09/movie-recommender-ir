<plot>One of the most popular attractions in Thailand is the Longneck women in the north. The Longnecks or Padaung wear gold colored coils are their neck, not elongating the neck but pushing the collar bone and rib cage down. The indigenous culture originally from Burma, fled their country fearing persecution from the military junta. They attained asylum in Thailand. But from persecution, they are now viewed as a tourist attraction. Thai government officials in the Mae Hong Son province claim that there would be no other reason to visit the region if it weren't for the Longnecks. Tourists are drawn each day. Hundreds upon hundreds of tourists leave the cities to enter the Nai Soi village. People take pictures and buy gifts to bring home. The Padaung are treated like a human circus. Do the Padaung mind being a tourist attraction? What do they want?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349508</url></doc>
