<plot>In a world dominated by computers, Dubydù, assistant to Maestro Calzino, operates. Calzino owns a company called "Valentino Park", a happy place where the hidden feelings and passions of men and women can be experienced. Dubydù, who has had enough, decides to leave "Valentino Park" and to set up, with his old friend, Virgola, a "Broken Hearts Agency". However Dubydù is unable to teach his clients how to love and causes them to react in the strangest ways. On the waves of the delirious Radiofolly, as he passes from one band to the next, he learns of the love of Nuvola, a lovely servant who works at the Midnight Kiss. Meanwhile evil bands try to get their hands on the sentiments business: it is open war. But Dubydù and Nuvola, with the aid of Master Calzino and the strength of the cinema industry, manage to make their dreams come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423542</url></doc>
