<plot>I discovered a wad of photocopies in my father's attic. Nothing to fuss about except that those photocopies are private documents belonging to Himmler and his daughter Unpublished documents of which I could not even request the origin from my father since he had died. That's how I started an investigation. Looking for original documents from the Himmler family, looking for Nazis, looking for the meaning of Shoa... looking for my father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239734</url></doc>
