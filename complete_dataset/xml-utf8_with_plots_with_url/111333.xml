<plot>Four young Americans who've each suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) emerge from their comas at a New Jersey medical facility. Their eyes may be open, but now the real challenge for each of the patients, their families, their doctors and their therapists begins. Brain healing isn't predictable, we're told, and certainly is not guaranteed. So with each 'major' step forward that is observed (opening one's eyes, bending a thumb upon command, vocalizing a word, answering a question correctly) comes a sense of jubilant relief--and hope--from the families of these patients, but as we soon see, the more a patient progresses, the more difficult things can be for all involved. Moments of faith &amp; hope contrast with disappointments &amp; frustrations, moments of confidence with moments of doubt. It's difficult to watch, and unimaginable to have to ever live through.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111333</url></doc>
