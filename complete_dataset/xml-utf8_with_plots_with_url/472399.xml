<plot>SKETCH, Inc. was created by Mike Fields and Nina Martinez, who were fresh out of high school and were going to Hollywood to do acting. They ended up at "The Groundlings", where comedy is born, and less than a month later were doing comedy at improv clubs. Mike and Nina along with friends Jay, Beth, and Rick created "The Sketch" to end all sketches. Little did they know that there was someone in the audience who was going to make them famous. "The Sketch" became SKETCH, Inc., a parody of a company that produces sketches. The group wrote all of their own material for every episode. The show lasted for 7 years, until the group finally got tired of the show and went their own ways, but still remained good friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472399</url></doc>
