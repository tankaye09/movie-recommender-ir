<plot>In the city of Machine, a ruthless serial killer by the name of White Rabbit, continues to put fear into the hearts of all people, as she evades capture yet again. Gryphen, new to the city, and with a history just as bad as the White Rabbits, is looking to make a name for himself. Best way to do that, is take down the White Rabbit. By doing so he will gain the respect of the crime lords and the fear of the public. But taking down the White Rabbit isn't going to be as easy as Gryphen thought it was going to be. Because once he tracks her down, Gryphen will find the White Rabbit has more than a few tricks up her sleeve.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291639</url></doc>
