<plot>Min, a 16 year-old boy always gets moved around from the Thai capital Bangkok to many of the rural provinces because of his father's career. He's a polite and quiet boy, and the local students always make fun of him just because he's from Bangkok. He later becomes friend with Oud, a local bad-boy who is really a good guy inside. Just like any other teenagers, Min falls in love at first sight with Fang, a pretty girl from the same school, but this love is going to be tough because of the opposition of Fang's father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290174</url></doc>
