<plot>On the closing day of the Pan-American Exposition, Saturday, November 2d, 1901, a sham battle took place at the Stadium on the Pan-American Exposition grounds, between the six tribes of American Indians and the United States Infantry stationed at Buffalo. The battle was most exciting and realistic, there being about 250 American Indians clad in their picturesque dress and fully decorated in their war paint. About half the Indians were mounted upon spirited horses. The attack was begun by the Infantry rushing the Indians who made a firm stand and succeeded in repulsing the soldiers. The scene is replete with charges and many hand to hand encounters. Most of the action took place close to our camera and the picture which we secured is excellent. The scene opens with a parade of the American Indians, which in itself is of great interest, the parade portion of the film consuming about 25 feet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490320</url></doc>
