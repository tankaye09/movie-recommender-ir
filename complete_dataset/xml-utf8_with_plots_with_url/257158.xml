<plot>Baby (AiAi delas Alas) is a veterinarian who bumps into a heroic fireman named Boy (Robin Padilla). Baby is unlucky in love. Her ex-boyfriend proved to be a freeloader who just wanted to avail of Baby's expertise for his pets and the pets of his other family members. Boy is just as unlucky since his former girlfriend, the mother of his son, left him for a foreigner. The fireman is now a single father worried how his son will turn out since he seems to be absorbing his grandmother's feminine traits and his aunt's dishonesty. But the community looks up to him since Boy always comes to his neighbors' rescue when it comes to small and big problems alike. During his time of need, Boy gets to meet Baby and in his gratitude, he promises to grant any wish that Baby asks of him. During the town fiesta, Baby announces that her one wish is to have a child of her own with Boy as the father. The fireman thinks that she is just kidding but Baby is dead serious since her biological clock is ticking. Will Boy keep his promise to Baby? Will this lead to a more serious relationship between the two people or will they continue to be unlucky in love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?257158</url></doc>
