<plot>Chris Payton is a twenty-something everyman; he's married, no kids, lives in the suburbs of Chicago, has a nine to five job and he hates every minute of it. In the weeks leading up to Christmas, he decides to do something about job, his friends, his everything. So, as his world unravels around him, his frustration hits its peak. And, when he fights with his wife, the only person who truly understands him, Chris finds himself alone. Cold December is a modern tale of a man going through a quarter-life crisis and the path he chooses to go down. In the end, he must chose to sit back and watch his life happen to him, or live it fully.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110448</url></doc>
