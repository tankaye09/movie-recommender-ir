<plot>After the tragic death from malaria of her beloved husband his rich widow Helga Vanroh travels restlessly around various Mediterranean countries. In the luxurious surroundings of a hotel in Monte Carlo Mrs. Vanroh keeps apart from society, until one evening she decides to visit the casino. There a young man attracts her curiosity and compassion. Sascha Lonay has again lost a fortune at the roulette-tables. In his desperation he ponders on taking his life, but Mrs. Vanroh is able to dissuade him by offering him a hotelroom, money to pay his debts - and her love. They spent the night together. The following day the couple travel to the mountains, where Sascha - overwhelmed by the beauty of life and her generosity - promises her to refrain from gambling and to take the next ship sailing from Marseille and look for an honest job. He begs her to accompany him to Marseille in the evening, but Mrs. Vanroh is too afraid of commitment. Alone again, she makes a final visit to the casino. Her efforts seem to have been useless: Like a madman Sascha has taken to the roulette-tables again.</plot><plot>After the tragic death from malaria of her beloved husband his rich widow Helga Vanroh travels restlessly around various Mediterranean countries.
