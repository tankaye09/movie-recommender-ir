<plot>The foreground shows a detachment of Japanese soldiers with a Gatling gun on top of a hill. The officer in command orders a drill. Just as the drill is finished a detachment of Russians is seen coming over an adjoining hill, and immediately an engagement takes place. The gun is run into position; but despite the heavy fire of the Japs, they are defeated by the Russians; the bombs thrown in their midst doing deadly work. The Russians are next seen capturing the gun and ammunition. They are soon surprised by a second detachment of Japanese and compelled to retreat. Very fine photographically.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?500409</url></doc>
