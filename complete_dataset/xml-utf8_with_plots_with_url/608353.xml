<plot>The aging Swift family of one brother, Jasper, and three sisters, April, May and June, are forced to live together in the run-down family mansion and they all get on each others nerves. One-eyed Jasper is the only one who does the cooking and he has occasional meetings with a monk from the nearby monastery. April was left some money when her husband died and is now practically deaf. May is a spinster who gives talks on flower arranging and also steals ornaments. The youngest, still called Baby June, was an avid horsewoman, but now relies on her farmhand Christy Lucey to train and ride her horse. One day, to their surprise, cousin Leda comes to visit and elicits various embarrassing family secrets. Leda, who is half Jewish and used to live in Vienna, stayed with the family when she was a teenager, but they thought she died in a concentration camp in the war.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608353</url></doc>
