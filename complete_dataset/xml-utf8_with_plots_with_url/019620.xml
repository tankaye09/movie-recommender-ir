<plot>Gavin Tartowski has been called a quack, a cult-leader, and a barista who sees himself as a guru. Looking for a support group to help him with his compulsion to wear extremely tight pants, Gavin was turned away from 12-step programs like AA, NA and GA. "Why all the labels?" Gavin asks. "Why not put all problems under one umbrella?" "That is why I created A. I want to help people no matter what their challenges are." The group's newest challenge is Benji, a troubled 35 year-old "huffer" whose mother has sent him to A. As the members struggle with Benji, they begin to work through their own inner-demons and start to see the value in their lives. Although Tartowski's methods are less than orthodox, his ability to heal is indisputable. This film is as life affirming as A itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019620</url></doc>
