<plot>36-year-old Vietnamese-American, Can Truong was raised to be strong-minded. He was a model student aspiring to be a doctor one day and got into the University of Chicago. At the University of Chicago, he had problems concentrating and studying so he sought professional help. He was diagnosed with depression and later hospitalized for it. While taking an anti-depressant, he experienced a manic episode. In his mania, he bought a brand new car for $32K, and he had grandiose ideas about changing the world. He thought he could single-handedly leverage the stock market. Can was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was eventually forced to leave college. Over a 12-year period, Can tried more than 20 different medication and underwent 15 electro-convulsive shock treatments.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092113</url></doc>
