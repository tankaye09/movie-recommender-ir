<plot>Arthur C. Clarke: before 2001 is the documentary Sci-Fi Channel calls, "eminently watchable and endearing mainly due to Clarke's obvious nostalgic joy as narrator." Re-released in 2008, the 15th Anniversary Edition features never before seen interviews with Clarke regarding a little known part of his life before he wrote 2001, an impromptu interview with Clarke's brother, Fred, in 2003, and Capt. Carl Fismer's reflection on diving with Clarke, filmed only one month before Clarke passed away. It features the only footage of Clarke SCUBA diving for the first time since he was stricken with polio in 1962.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046612</url></doc>
