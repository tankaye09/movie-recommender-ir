<plot>A documentary that explores the brave new world of young people on the internet. For many kids the internet has become a neighborhood where they can go, have fun, learn and interact with friends. It's a great place to hang out but can also be dangerous. This is the story of five American teenagers and their lives online. From cyber bullying to child porn, these teenagers have lived the dark side of the net. Now through UR Life Online they share their experiences with the hope of helping kids and parents live safely on the net.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624278</url></doc>
