<plot>August 24, 1942. Trapped by history, a loving mother writes a farewell letter to her son just days before she dies in the Thereseinstadt concentration camp during the Holocaust. Lost for nearly 50 years, the letter mysteriously reaches her son in 1985 when he is 79 years old. The Fate Did Not Let Me Go film shares the inspiring story of Valli Ollendorf and her timeless letter to her son Ulrich. More than a mother's farewell, the letter's message of faith, hope and love stands as a triumph of the human spirit in history's darkest hour. For years, the letter remained a family secret. When Ulrich passed away, his family asked their rabbi to read the letter at his eulogy. The impact of the letter - and its expression of love that transcended time and space and even death itself - was so grat that the family realized it was much more than a private letter. It was a letter that could inspire every person it touched.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520190</url></doc>
