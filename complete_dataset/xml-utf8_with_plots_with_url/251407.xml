<plot>A documentary about mental health care in Victorian Britain detailing treatments such as clitoridectomy and genital massage. Not for the fainthearted. At a time when masturbation was thought to be seriously damaging to the health, patients diagnosed with hysteria were subjected to a brutal and physical 'cure' for the mental condition which produced symptoms such as fits or paroxysms. Several years later medical opinion changed, resulting in a more holistic and therapeutic form of treatment. Using cut-out and sand animation this film packs a curious chunk of medical history into a very small film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?251407</url></doc>
