<plot>Millionaire playboy caveman Millstone Rockafella arranges a wild and wacky BC bike race and the winner will receive the ultimate boulder-dash bike. Cool and crazy Cliff Ace has had his sunglasses set on a boulder-dash bike since he was knee-high, so he signs up for the race, taking his cave-babe Roxy along for the ride! But he faces some rock-hard competition in the form of Sid Viscous, Granite Jackstone and several other fast and fierce opponents. The game is very similar to the Mario Kart series of games. Each of the racers in this game rides a prehistoric motorcycle with a side car. On each two-character team, one person drives the motorcycle, and the other fights off opponents using clubs, punches, kicks, etc. Graphics in BC Racers consist of completely flat but very colorful landscapes decorated with scaled sprites to compose the track and scenery. Tracks range from prehistoric villages, night races, jungles, swamps, snow-covered, caves, lava pits and deserts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?053896</url></doc>
