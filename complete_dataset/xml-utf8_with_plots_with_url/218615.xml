<plot>A traveller enters the room of a hotel and proceeds to disrobe, apparently going to bed. He seats himself upon a chair, but the chair flies from under him and places itself upon the mantelpiece. He grabs the chair in great anger and attempts to seat himself again, when he finds the snow is flying in the window. He closes the window, and in utter exhaustion throws himself upon the bed and finds the bed has suddenly been transformed into a bureau, the top of which is very hard. He takes a drink from a mysterious black bottle and stretches himself out on the bureau to sleep, but it suddenly turns into a boat which is rocking in a heavy sea. The traveller falls overboard, and makes strenuous efforts to swim ashore. He suddenly awakens, and finds himself lying upon the floor in his chamber, going through the evolutions of a swimmer. He, too, finds it is all a dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218615</url></doc>
