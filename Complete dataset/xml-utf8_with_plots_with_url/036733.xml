<plot>The scene opens in the interior of an artist's studio. Mephisto appears mysteriously and signals the pictures to come to life. They step down from the frames and walk forward, admiring their costumes. Mephisto then touches the artist on the shoulder, awakening him, and disappears. The artist, after rubbing his eyes, sees the picture on his right hand side and jumps up to embrace her. After embracing her once, he makes a second attempt and she disappears. The artist now wakes up, jumps to his feet, and runs to see if the picture are still in the frames. He examines them and finding that they are still fast on the wall, realizes that the has been dreaming and seeks consolation in the bottle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036733</url></doc>
