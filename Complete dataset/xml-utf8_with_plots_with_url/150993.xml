<plot>Take center stage with your own life script to be successful in any field. Efren had a choice: Take a high-paying, big-studio role in Alamo, starring Billy Bob Thornton, or take a small, no-money-upfront role as "Pedro" in Napoleon Dynamite. Efren's gamble launched him to international success and he has worked every day since. Chris had an idea: Why not get a corporation to pay for his college education? He became a national spokesperson for FIRST USA, a division of Bank One. He garnered over 20 million dollars in publicity for the bank and over 80 million media impressions during the campaign. He has been featured on the Today Show, CBS Early Show, ABC, NBC, FOX, MSNBC, CNN and profiled in People magazine twice, including the "25 Most Intriguing people" issue. Efren and Chris wrote the script for their own lives -- and now they're living their dreams. They share their story with tens of thousands of young adults all over the country, and now they share a five-act formula to help college students and young professionals take charge of their future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150993</url></doc>
