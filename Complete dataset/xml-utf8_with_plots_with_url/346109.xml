<plot>Bill, a middle aged married man, gets an email from his old flame Linda. She wants to meet for dinner. He falls into a boyish day dream. He consults his friend who knows the history but doesn't get the reaction he hopes for. Unsure but undaunted he marshalls on. At home, the date looming, he argues with his wife but they resolve it quickly as only a married couple can. He lies to her, anyway. Unsure but undaunted, he goes on his date. Neighbors lurking discover him but only after he makes an unexpected discovery of his own. What one woman finds endearing another will not, so how is he to react? Where does he really belong? What he knows doesn't jibe with what he wants. He has to decide based on their reactions to a quirk of his. It's not a lot to go on but it turns out to be plenty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346109</url></doc>
