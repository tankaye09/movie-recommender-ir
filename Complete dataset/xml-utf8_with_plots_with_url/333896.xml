<plot>Letting Go of God is a one-person-monologue by Julia Sweeney chronicling her search for God. She rejoins the Catholic Church (the church in which she was raised and for which she is affectionate) and takes a Bible study class, which sends her in a tailspin towards Buddhism, and then various New Age gurus and finally accepting that there is no evidence for God at all. Then she deals with her family's negative reaction to her philosophical change.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333896</url></doc>
