<plot>The violent story of Jay and Jonnie Linski, two Polish-Irish brothers who try to come to terms with the brutal murder of their youngest sibling, Danny. The story follows the terrible hallucinatory visions that haunt bare-knuckle fighter Jonnie, as he battles with his own demons and a personal investigation into those responsible for the killing. As all his close relationships begin to crumble about him, he plunges head-long into a violent chain of events that will leave murder and mayhem following closely on his heels. Set in what could be any European City (and none specifically). Told through the emotional pain of the characters closest to the murdered Danny and the sometimes violent events that follow on from the actions of these same tortured few.</plot><plot>The violent story of Jay and Jonnie Linski, two Polish-Irish brothers who try to come to terms with the brutal murder of their youngest sibling, Danny.
