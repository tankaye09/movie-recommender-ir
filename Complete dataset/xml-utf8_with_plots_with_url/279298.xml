<plot>Having spent over two years with the British supermodel, Jordan, Richard Macer has seen everything. He has seen her robbed, giving birth, dealing with tabloids, dealing with a blind son and dealing with cancer. In this final instalment of this documentary trilogy, he continues to follow her life as she attempts to branch out of her 9-year career as a glamour model into the world of music as a singer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279298</url></doc>
