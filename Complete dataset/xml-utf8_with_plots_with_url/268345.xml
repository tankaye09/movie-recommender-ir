<plot>The impact of such strict laws on homosexuality in Iran is examined through the life of asylum seeker Ramtin. Following the capture and torture of his boyfriend in Tehran, he now finds himself building a new life in Leeds. Ramtin and close friend Ali shed light on a situation ending the lives of many young men in their native country. This remarkable documentary finds Ramtin making the most of life in the U.K, playing flamenco guitar on local radio, practicing with a professional dancer and forming a support group for other gay Iranians. Yet fear of prosecution upon return to Iran, leaves Ramtin with his life in the balance as the Home Office continue to deny him citizenship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268345</url></doc>
