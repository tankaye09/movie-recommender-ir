<plot>Here's one of the funniest ever, and especially a good picture to show an audience largely composed of men. It represents a magician, who walks upon the stage with a large white hen and places her upon a table. He immediately produces six eggs from her, and breaking the eggs one by one into a dish, the contents turn into chickens immediately they have fallen upon the plate, each of the chickens walking about the table in a lively manner. The conjurer then holds his hands over the plate and one by one the shells of the eggs come together, the chickens in the meantime flying back into their places in the shells. The eggs are then returned to the hen one by one and she walks away from the table apparently satisfied. A picture that is startling and at the same time interesting and comical. We recommend this as a great winner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?313742</url></doc>
