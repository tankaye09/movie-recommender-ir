<plot>In the year of 1776, the British Army invaded New York, storming its shores. The Battle of Brooklyn had begun. New York was at war. With General George Washington holding ground on Manhattan Island, the strength of the British was proving to be too strong. Defeat was expected. Washington expressed his concern about losing to the British and feared his fight for independence was in jeopardy. He realized that more information was needed about British movements to ensure the survival of his Army. He called for a volunteer to travel behind enemy lines and return with any information about the British General Howe's plan of attack. Despite the pleas of his friends and fellow officers, one man volunteered for the job. Assuming the disguise of a Dutch Schoolmaster, he moves quietly into enemy territory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390507</url></doc>
