<plot>Things aren't going well for Frank Forte. His wife, the sultry Lola, is openly cheating on him, his boss, Roy, uses him as daily ego toilet paper, and his co-workers don't even know he exists. Frank has reached his limit, however, and his salvation (or doom) comes in the form of a psychotic belief that he is the new messiah for a coming robot invasion. Though the robots are certainly delusion, their effect on Frank and his life are concrete.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?368812</url></doc>
