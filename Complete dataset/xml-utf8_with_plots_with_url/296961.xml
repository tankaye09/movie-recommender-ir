<plot>What do you get when you cross a rabbi, a Mormon, and a group of cattle ranchers? Kosher Valley, a contemporary parable about the American Dream. This documentary depicts the unlikely business relationship between a community of Southern Colorado ranchers and a rabbi from Baltimore. Bonded by beef, the ranchers and the rabbi hire a slick Mormon business manager to help launch a kosher slaughterhouse and co-op. Initially this arrangement appears to be a match made in heaven-but major problems soon arise and director Chuck Davis's unobtrusive camera captures the dramatic real-life scenarios as they rapidly unravel. Examining everything from American economics to kosher philosophy, Kosher Valley is an unusually funny and universally relevant commentary on the possibilities of partnership.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?296961</url></doc>
