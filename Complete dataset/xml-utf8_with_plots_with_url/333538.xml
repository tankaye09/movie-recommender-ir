<plot>Monty Hall hosts this hilarious half-hour gameshow in which audience contestants picked at random, dressed in ridiculous costumes, try to win cash or prizes by choosing curtain number 1, 2 or 3. Before the contestant could decide, Monty would tempt them with something from within a small box, or flash cash in front of them. It was the contestant's chance to win something big, but deep down, they knew they might get "zonked" by choosing the wrong curtain. Some contestants actually ended up with a donkey or pig, or other rotten prize, and some actually came out with cars, cash or jewelry. Near the end of every show, Monty would give out cash prizes to anyone carrying whatever it was he asked for. You should see some of the strange things people carry!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333538</url></doc>
