<plot>A young writer named Seth (Alex Gasbarro), sets out to find a Film Producer to Help Him Bring His ideas to the Big Screen. Instead He Finds Producer Andy Fineman (Mark F. Ott), who has his own Ideas about what a Film should be. On their Very First Meeting Andy "Convinces" Seth to "Keep an open Mind", and he and his assistant are soon suggesting a whirlwind of changes to the script. Small "Adjustments" to script, setting. Dialogue, and even the Plot itself. Not the least of which is replacing the Female lead with a beautiful Young Girl.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654558</url></doc>
