In the process they have tortured villagers and something dreadful happens and Rupi disappears. When Kanna comes back from Nagpur both the persons he loved the most Rupi and Ghisu are not there for him. He is under the impression that Rupi is dead. He makes all efforts to bring Ghisu back but does not succeed. Actually Rupi is not dead. She has also become a Naxalite. She knows that Kanna is back but now she does not want to go back to him. Naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles because of their capacity to give instant justice and more and more youths are joining them. Ghisu and Rupi are now promoted as commanders of their new Dalam. On the other hand, Govt. has taken serious note of the situation and special task force is sent to the jungle to deal with Naxal problem. War between Kanna's non-violence and Rajayya violence begins.
