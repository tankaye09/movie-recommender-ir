<plot>The ocean is as vast as it is mysterious. More than seventy percent of our planet is covered by water, yet less than one percent of it has been explored. In this alien environment, the line between fact and theory is blurred. This, the unknown, has been a motivating factor of Karl Stanley's for his entire life. By the age of fifteen, Karl started building the first of two groundbreaking, deep-sea submersibles. Now, at the age of 32, he's logged over 1,000 dives between them both and he's not shy to gloat about it. A View From Below follows this pioneer into the deep sea on his unprecedented, controversial quest to "Go Deeper".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017797</url></doc>
