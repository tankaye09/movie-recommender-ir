<plot>Faith is on her way to Delano when she stops to pick up a hitchhiker, Adam, on his way to his mother's funeral. They start sharing their stories along the way. Adam is, as he puts it, a "wannabe writer" with a failed career and Faith is reluctant to reveal much about her life. After Adam reveals his dark secret, he turns the table on Faith. As he keeps prying, Faith closes down and leaves him stranded. This turn of event leads to an ending that neither saw coming. 'A Moment In Purgatory' is the story about two people meeting under unlikely circumstances who find a connection with each other that they could not find in others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013489</url></doc>
