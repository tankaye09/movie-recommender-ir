<plot>"Imagine your body telling your brain it doesn't want it in there anymore," says Reade Whinnem, "and then doing everything it can to try and make it leave." Whinnem suffers from Panic Anxiety Disorder, and in Panic Attack, we are taken full-throttle into Whinnem's living nightmare. Combining interview footage with hyperkinetic time lapse and stop-motion animation, the film illustrates with expressionistic force the physical and emotional roller-coaster ride Whinnem calls daily life. This short reveals the determination it takes to survive battles no one can witness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421684</url></doc>
