<plot>'Lost Causes' is a neo-noir set in Oakland, California. This is where criminal defense attorney, Archer Keats, struggles to maintain his office overlooking the city. Archer hasn't tried a case in three years. When a high-profile, gangland murder falls in his lap, his first instinct is to find a way out of the case. As he and his investigator, struggle to unravel tangled allegiances and contradictory clues, what Archer assumed was a dead case begins to take on new life. A trial - something Archer desperately wants to avoid - looms on the horizon, and Archer is forced to confront the demons that have haunted him since his last case.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343525</url></doc>
