<plot>Emerging from a long line of Swedish carpenters and cabinetmakers, designer Bruno Mathsson developed a nuanced, independent vision for improving standards of living that exemplifies Scandinavian modernism. The film Bruno is Back (2001) examines Mathsson's life in the context of his surroundings, his design contemporaries, and his international peers Piet Hein, Hans Wegner, Alvar Aalto, and Frank Lloyd Wright. Filmed in and around his hometown of Värnamo, we meet the region's hardworking people and experience their exceptional spirit of enterprise and innovation. The film presents Mathsson's multifaceted persona as an industrialist, businessman, and innovator whose furniture and architecture are unsurpassed in their combination of elegant form and rational function.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084774</url></doc>
