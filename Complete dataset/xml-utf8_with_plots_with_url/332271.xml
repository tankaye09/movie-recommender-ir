<plot>In 14th-century France, Vilain is a peasant who prays often and fervently to Saint Martin. Touched by this devotion, the Saint appears to the peasant and offers him four wishes. Villain tells his robust and disbelieving wife, who laughingly makes a wish for anatomical changes in her husband. Saint Martin complies, and Villain replies in kind with a wish of his own about his wife's body. They're now in a fix; the woman makes another wish, and the two are left with less than that with which they started. They do have a final, inevitable wish. His work done, Saint Martin sighs and departs for Heaven after a last word of advice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?332271</url></doc>
