<plot>A look at life in a rapidly developing new China. Workers recruited from villages into Beijing's construction industry tell their stories of a culture in flux. Their displacement from loved ones, financial desperation, and hopes are set against the backdrop of the city they are daily transforming in preparation for the 2008 Olympics. Prolific young novelist and filmmaker Xiaolu Guo illustrates with reference to her own migration from a provincial fishing village, music, and stories of her own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549852</url></doc>
