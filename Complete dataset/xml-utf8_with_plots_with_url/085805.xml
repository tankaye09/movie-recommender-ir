<plot>A parade on a broad Buffalo avenue. A stationary camera is pointed so the parade approaches it and passes to its right, the buildings of downtown line the background. A uniformed band passes first, then sets of two rows of nearly 20 officers each, shoulder to shoulder across virtually the entire street, march past, ten yards between each set of two rows. Three such groupings pass, and as the reel ends, the mounted patrolmen come into view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085805</url></doc>
