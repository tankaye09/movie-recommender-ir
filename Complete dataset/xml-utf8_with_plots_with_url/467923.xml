<plot>Presented in English and Armenian (with English subtitles) this is a simple, tender story about a proud single father, his relationships with his family, and his struggles to make ends meet as an immigrant in urban America. Zaven works as a mechanic in a Los Angeles gas station, and lives in a small apartment with his seven-year-old daughter Amy. His sister Armineh is married to a more affluent, better educated man. With almost cinema verite honesty and intimacy, the film features many exquisite moments of tenderness, vulnerability and yearning, and offers a personal look at the Armenian immigrant community. "Roof To Roof" is an exploration into the feelings of characters, asking tough questions about the importance and difficulty of family love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?467923</url></doc>
