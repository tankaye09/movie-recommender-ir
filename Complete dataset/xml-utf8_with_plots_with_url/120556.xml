<plot>In this Mexican version of Capra's It Happened One Night (1934), Elsa, the daughter of a governor, is running away from him because he wants to marry her with a man that she doesn't love. Luis is a sales man, traveling to promote a new brand tequila. Elsa's locked in her house by her father, but she manages to escape from there and takes a train to travel from Sinaloa to Mexico City. There, she meets Luis, who doesn't stand to much the presence of the girl because of a romantic disappointment from the past. In the first stop, Elsa sees that the police is looking for her and Luis, finding out that the girl's being chased, offers to help her. The governor thinks that his daughter has been kidnapped, and offers a reward for references about her location. After having passed by a hotel and even a small hut in the countryside, Elsa seems to start to have feelings about Luis, but he's still a little bit angry about women.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?120556</url></doc>
