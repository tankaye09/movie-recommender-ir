<plot>For all those Beyoncé fans who played out their original copy of B'Day, have no fear, Beyoncé was thinking about you, and she's about to hit you with that serious upgrade! B'Day is coming back bigger and badder than ever. With two brand new songs, and music videos for every song on the album, B'Day, Volume 2 is a must-have for serious Beyoncé fans. BET is first to bring you B's new heat. Hosted by the woman of the hour, "B'Day - The Upgrade" will feature four never-before-seen videos, as well as exclusive behind-the-scenes dirt on the making of all the videos on the album. There will be a half-hour version of the show, which will premiere the four new videos, and an hour version, which will include all videos from the album and an exclusive interview with Beyoncé.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?053726</url></doc>
