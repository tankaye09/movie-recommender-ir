<plot>A celebrity interview show. Each show was usually devoted to a single celebrity. Brian Linehan was the interviewer, and he was especially noted for the rare depth of his research. Celebrities were often startled, flattered, or dismayed by the questions he would ask about less frequently discussed or even obscure aspects of their lives and careers. His questioning was probing and revealing, but never adversarial. His most famous interview was one done with Burt Reynolds, where Reynolds exclaimed, "You just hit nerves." Apparently, for some time, Linehan's unprecedented interview approach made this show a popular fad among celebrities in Hollywood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107444</url></doc>
