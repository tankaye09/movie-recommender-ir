<plot>In this animated spoof of the Warner Bros. horror film, "HOUSE OF WAX", a deranged psychopath has his way with one Paris Hilton. The animation was built around actual dialog extracted from an interview Paris Hilton did to promote her role in the film. In a strange way the movie's marketing hinged on the idea that a backlash against Paris Hilton's over-exposed celebrity was immanent. With this project the line between promotion and subversion was blurred, playing into the fact that for a portion of the film's audience the main selling point was the opportunity to see Paris Hilton brutalized and murdered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484290</url></doc>
