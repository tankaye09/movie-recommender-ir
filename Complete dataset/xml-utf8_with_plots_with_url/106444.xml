<plot>Cinderumplestilskin is a traditonal English pantomine based on two classic fairytales; Cinderella and Rumplestiltskin. In this combined fairytale, the beautiful Cinderella is forced to work as a servant for her two wicked stepsisters. Rumplestiltskin (in place of the fairy godmother from the Cinderella tale) appears and gives her a gown, glass slippers and a coach made from a pumpkin. Cinderella goes to the ball where she meets the handsome priest. They fall in love and get married, but years later Rumplestiltskin demans their daughter as payment. He agrees to spare them if Cinderella can guess his name, which she eventually does.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106444</url></doc>
