<plot>Three friends (Stu, Tommy and Gus) go on their annual trip this time, they're going fishing. Stu (who also brings his girlfriend, Julia, along) is suffering from money problems and they were unable to get the boat they had thought they reserved. So they are forced to charter a boat from Louis Morgan. Louis brings along his first mate, Charlie (short for Charlotte). As they begin fishing they slowly move into a thick fog and later find themselves upon an old boat, HMS Queen of Scots, which was a luxury liner that disappeared many years ago. Soon they find themselves in a deadly game of greed and deception.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597022</url></doc>
