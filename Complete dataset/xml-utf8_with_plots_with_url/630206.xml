<plot>A young woman is going to Paris by bus, but when she steps out of her house she discovers that her garden and the whole village is flooded with water. With a boat and a bike she succeeds to reach a dry spot in the village. There a young man in a car offers her a lift. They drive around in circles, trying to find a way out of the area, but all ways are blocked by the water. Concurrently with the ever rising water the emotions within the two young people also start rising. At last they find their way out of the flooded area. When they reach Paris and the young woman looks up at the Eiffel Tower, she knows that she is going to spend the night with this man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?630206</url></doc>
