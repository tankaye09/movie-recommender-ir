<plot>Ted Zakalokis' family has a bakery and it has always been assumed that he would one day work there. But that's not what he wants to do. So to avoid that he enlists in the army and after getting out, he gets a temporary job working in the mail room of a Hollywood talent agency under Richie Herby. Now most of the people who work in the mail room are hoping that one of the agents will need a new secretary thus paving the way for them to be agents themselves. One of these persons is Laurie Parr, who Teddy tries to hit on but is shut down. While there he meets Abe Werkfinder, the head of the agency and basically a nice guy. He also meets Al Floss, the quintessential agent, oily, sneaky, deceptive. One day one his clients is arriving and he instructs Richie to meet him cause he doesn't want any of the other "mail room" people making a move on his client. Richie, not wanting to give him the satisfaction, sends Teddy instead. Now the man is arrogant, and pompous, he picks a fight with Teddy, that ends with Teddy slugging him to his knees. Teddy's spunk impresses the man that he wants Teddy to be his agent now. Al Floss is not happy about it, and he tries to dissuade Teddy from accepting his request. But Abe Werkfinder feeling that as long as the man wants to stay with his agency, he must do what he can to make him happy. So he convinces Teddy to accept, the high paying job, and instructs Al to train him. But Al is not exactly in his corner, so Teddy must rely on Richie and his secretary Laurie for help. And because his name is such a tongue twister, Mr. Werkfinder dubs him Teddy Z.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556822</url></doc>
