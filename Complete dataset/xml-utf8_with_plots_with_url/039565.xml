<plot>'Andy' is a documentary which profiles an interesting man, Andy Ofiesh. Andy's hobbies include yoga, trapeze, and performing stand-up comedy completely naked. As the host and founder of The Naked Comedy Showcase, a Boston and New York based comedy show in which a variety of stand-up comedians perform nude, Andy combines his experience with nudism with his interest in performing comedy. Andy explains his motivations for his unusual profession, and gives some insight into what it means to him to be able to accept one's self, and to find those people who will accept you for who you are as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039565</url></doc>
