<plot>After their successful colaboration in 1968's "T.C.B." TV special, Diana Ross and The Supremes join The Temptations one more time. This time, the two super-groups not only sing but act in some innovative musical comedy sketches based on the greatest Broadway and Hollywood music and plots. It must be noted that although both the girls and the guys are great they don't come accross as exciting as when they perform their usual Motown stuff. Temptations are particularly boring in an overlong medley from "Fiddler in the Roof" but Miss Ross, who by this time was all that Motown cared about, is extremely effective in her "Leading Lady" medley.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208088</url></doc>
