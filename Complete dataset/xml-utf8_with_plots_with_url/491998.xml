<plot>Shell is a roadside movie about a teenage girl who has grown up in a remote petrol station in the Scottish Highlands. Abandoned by her mother when she was a child Shell has stayed to take care of her dying father but now feels trapped within the beautiful but desolate landscape that surrounds her. With only her routine of running the decaying petrol station, taking care of her father, and spending afternoons in her bedroom with a local mechanic, life is passing Shell by with every passing truck that rattles her walls. One day a salesman stops to re-fuel and offers Shell a taste of the outside world that takes her closer than ever to the edge of the road and her desire to escape. Shot on location in the Scottish Highlands and starring up and coming Scottish actress Lorna Craig, Sandy Morton (London to Brighton) as her father, and Paul Higgins (Red Road) as the salesman, "Shell" is an intense and claustrophobic film that pays homage to classic American films such as "Badlands" and "Paris Texas".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491998</url></doc>
