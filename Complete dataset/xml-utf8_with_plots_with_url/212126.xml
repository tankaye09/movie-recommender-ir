<plot>This film is based on the real life kidnapping spree of Cheung Tze-Keung who was eventually executed in China December, 1998. Cheung Chi-ho (Simon Yam) makes a living by kidnapping the children of very rich people. However, he's a nice guy outside of 'work', even going so far as to help a little old lady cross the street as the film begins. Cheung Chi-ho is plotting to kidnap several adult sons of Chinese millionaires. Because of their vicious threats, most of these cases go unreported to the cops, and all goes well, until Cheung teams up with another big-time criminal, Cyclone. On their first job, the rich victim calls the police, and Cheung Chi-ho must strategize his next move against the police.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212126</url></doc>
