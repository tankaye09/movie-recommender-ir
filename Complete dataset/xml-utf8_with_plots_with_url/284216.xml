<plot>Sports scientist Ken Spalding and his physiotherapist wife Charlotte Rata have two children - budding league player Humphrey and pro-Maori university student Ma. They also share their urban home with Pa Wiremu, Charlotte's staunch Ngati Porou father, while posh Muriel Spalding is Ken's mother. Muriel tells people her grandkids are Italian to 'save face' with her upper crust friends. Pa is rather keen on Muriel. Ken thinks it's a mistake to have his father in law living with him. Pa intends to be a thorn in his side. The plot thickens.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284216</url></doc>
