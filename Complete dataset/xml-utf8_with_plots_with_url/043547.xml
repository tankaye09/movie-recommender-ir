<plot>As much as some people would like to regard boxing as nothing more than a brute contest of physical endurance, the sport also has its spiritual side. The importance of attitude, of psyching yourself up and psyching out your opponent, of maintaining a feeling of emotional and physical self-mastery under extreme stress, is almost as crucial to winning as physical strength and agility. That point is brought home again and again in "Apollo," whose protagonist is tested by his own vanity and doubt, as often as he is challenged by his opponent in the ring. Combining boxing, poetry, and music, the film strives to capture an authentic quality in consciousness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043547</url></doc>
