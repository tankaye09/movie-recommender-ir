<plot>Year: 1974 Cindy is at college when she learns of the passing of her mother. She must return home to claim her inheritance, which includes the mansion and grounds. Before leaving she mets with Arthur, the family lawyer, who tells her something of the family history, which is shrouded in mystery. Arthur tells her that the mansion has been maintained for some time by her aunt, who has a bit of an odd reputation- the townspeople think she is a witch! Cindy is greeted warmly by Aunt Meredith, but the coffee is drugged, and Cindy soon learns that her aunt is indeed a witch, and Cindy is to be inducted into a cult, which practices an interesting form of sexual black magic.
