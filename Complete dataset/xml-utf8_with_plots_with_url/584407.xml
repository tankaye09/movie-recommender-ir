<plot>The professor is a strenuous individual, who is so carried away in his instruction to a pretty young girl that he attempts to make real love to her. Her father catches him at it and throws him bodily through a window. Very well done and funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584407</url></doc>
