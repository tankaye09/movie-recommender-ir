<plot>In this film, we show the interior of a doctor's office. A patient enters, and judging from the expression on his face, he is in great pain. The doctor tells him that he is troubled with acute indigestion, and immediately places him upon the operating table. He begins his treatment by cutting off the patient's arms and legs with a huge saw. After removing these members, he takes a large knife and makes an incision in the unfortunate's stomach large enough to put his arm in. He then removes such things as bottles, knives and forks, lamps and other articles of furniture from the patient's body. The patient evidently complains of the great pain he is suffering, and to relieve this the doctor cuts off his head and places it upon a near-by chair. Next a large water pump is brought into play, and after pumping about two gallons of water from the stomach of the patient the doctor sews up the wound, which heals immediately, then places the head back in its place. He next attempts to adjust the man's legs and arms in their proper places, but in his hurry a leg is placed where an arm should be, and vice versa. After discovering his mistake he corrects it, and the man, entirely cured of his trouble, rises from the table and after paying the doctor his fee departs from the office in great glee.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?630236</url></doc>
