<plot>In addition there is also another League contribution - 'In a League of Its Own' - a featurette about the film's influence on The League of Gentlemen (10:13) These League items can be found on The Tigon Collection, a six disc DVD box set of six of Tigon's horror films, including the studio's best two - 'Witchfinder General' and 'Blood on Satan's Claw'. The Gents' commentary is a must if you're a fan. Their affection for the film is apparent, but this does not stop them from being brilliantly irrelevant too with extremely funny random observations, typical of The League's commentaries for their own DVD releases.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075665</url></doc>
