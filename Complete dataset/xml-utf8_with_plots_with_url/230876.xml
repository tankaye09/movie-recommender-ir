<plot>Harry Monument has a junk food problem - he's been found murdered in a pile of French fries. Harry's partner, private-eye Keno Argyle, snags a job as a stand-in on a Kung Fu movie, gets kicked in the head by an overzealous action director and imagines himself in Los Angeles on the trail of Harry's killer. His search leads him to a seductive beauty with a hidden agenda and a sinister scheme involving a mysterious cookbook, a one-eyed building inspector with a wooden leg, millions of used bricks and a number of drowned little people. Homicide cops Blume and Quinlan prowl the underworld along with Keno and, in a convoluted denouement, the true identity of the killer is revealed. A tongue-in-cheek homage to noir, HARRY MONUMENT provides enough twists and turns to see Hammett and Chandler spinning in their graves. Private eye Keno Argyle imagines himself in Los Angeles on the trail of his partner's killer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230876</url></doc>
