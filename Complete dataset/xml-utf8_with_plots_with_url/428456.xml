<plot>Two contestants competed. Host James poses a moral-type question (e.g., "Should a wife be a stay-at-home mother?" "Is it alright to kiss in public?") to the contestants and a panel of 15 celebrities. The two contestants take opposite sides, giving a brief explanation supporting their stance. Host James then polls each member of the celebrity panel, who gave their answer and a usually humorous explanation. Each vote was worth one point; the first contestant to score four points won $25 for the question. The contestant who scored $100 first won a prize. This game would later be retooled into "The Celebrity Game," which aired in 1964 and 1965 on CBS.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?428456</url></doc>
