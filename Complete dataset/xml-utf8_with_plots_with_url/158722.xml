<plot>Meet Dr. von Kaiser. He is a short, stout, German evil scientist hell bent on taking over the world. The only problem is that he isn't very good at it and over-complicates everything he does. His main rival, Dr. Nemesis, is a tall, skinny, British man that has taken evil science corporate with a net worth valued in the billions. The two of them have been at each other's throats since college and, now that a newcomer Dr. Sophia Sapphire has thrown herself into the mix, the competition is about to heat up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158722</url></doc>
