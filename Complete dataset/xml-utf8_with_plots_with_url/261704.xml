<plot>A clever young man cons a stranger out of his breakfast through a dramatic and intricate story he made up on the spot. This smooth talker continues through his day taking advantage of and ignoring the needs of others all around him. Suddenly a van drives up, abducts him, and forces the young man to put on a knock-off superhero costume, cape and all. This sends him tumbling into an elaborate heist, which he is forced to take part in. He escapes his captors and is pursued through the city streets and parks still dressed in the colorful tights of a pathetic superhero. He is forced to rely on the stranger he had taken advantage of in the beginning who reluctantly agrees to help him. The young man is humbled as he watches the stranger and his coworkers heroically put their lives on the line for him. Ironically he is the one wearing the superhero costume. The young man discovers the harmful nature of human selfishness, what it really means to be a hero, and the power of truly loving your neighbor</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261704</url></doc>
