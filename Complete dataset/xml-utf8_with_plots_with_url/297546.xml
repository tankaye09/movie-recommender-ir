<plot>Krazy Kat, carrying his banjo, leaves home and flies his plane "Kazook" to the house of Ignatz Mouse, whom he loves. Outside Ignatz's window, Krazy starts his serenade. Meanwhile, Ignatz sneaks off to Kelly's Brick Yard and returns with a load of bricks, which he throws at the unsuspecting Krazy from behind. It's no news to Krazy when he's told he has the wrong house.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?297546</url></doc>
