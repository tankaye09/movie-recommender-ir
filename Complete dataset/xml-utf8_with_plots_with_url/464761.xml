<plot>Sgt. Conniston and his alcoholic guide O'Toole are on the trail of an escaped murderer named Keith. When they catch up with him in the farthest reaches of Northern Canada, Keith turns out to be a dead ringer for Conniston. On the way back, the sled overturns, Keith grabs the gun and leaves them to die in the snow. After second thoughts he comes back and brings them to safety at an RCMP emergency cabin. Conniston dies of a frozen lung. O'Toole becomes convinced of Keith's innocence and refuses to take him in. Instead he helps Keith disguise himself as Conniston to escape. Before he can do so, he is spotted by Mounties looking for Conniston and brought back to Conniston's fort. During the time Conniston was gone, it was discovered that Keith was innocent of the charges. Still Keith can't reveal his true identity for fear the Mounties will think he killed Conniston. Keith plans to keep up the charade only long enough to escape but Miriam, who Conniston had unsuccessfully pursued, is intrigued by the 'changed' Conniston and falls for him and he for her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?464761</url></doc>
