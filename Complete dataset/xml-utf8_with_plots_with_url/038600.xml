<plot>Kiran (Akash) and Aishwarya (Rekha) are neighbors for 20 years in Hyderabad. They study in the same college and immensely hate each other. Rekha's parents shift to Ooty. In Ooty house, Aishwarya founds an unopened greeting card addressed to Deepika (Tanu Roy). Aishwarya comes to know that Deepika is the girl who stayed in that room in the past. Deepika committed suicide because her lover Vamsi (Venkat) did not return after going to Hyderabad. Aishwarya opens the letter addressed to Deepika and realizes that Vamsi wrote it. It's a sensitive letter written by Vamsi explaining his feelings towards her. Aishwarya does not want to disappoint Vamsi that Deepika is no more. She starts writing letters on the name of 'Deepika'. Interestingly, on the other side Kiran would be replying all these mails on the name of 'Vamsi', as Vamsi dies of accident in Hyderabad.
