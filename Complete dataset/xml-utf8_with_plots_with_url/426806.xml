<plot>A camping trip on Wild Mountain becomes a life changing adventure for the Club (a group of four young forest animal characters led by a wise bear named Paw Paw Chuck) and their new friend, Wally. Surrounded by the beauty of the mountainside, C.J. is surprised when Wally admits that he doesn't believe in anything he can't see - including God. With the help of Paw Paw Chuck and the others, C.J. tries to figure out how we can "see the unseen". At night, a fierce windstorm whips across the Precipice Lake, blowing over tents and trees. Paw Paw Chuck and the Club kids quickly scramble for safety. In an interesting turn of events, Wally sees first hand that what is 'invisible' is in fact, very real.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426806</url></doc>
