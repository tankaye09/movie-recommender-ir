<plot>After a few years spent as an immigrant in Belgium, Antonio is back in his village in the South of Italy. He dreams of leaving again, for Argentina this time, but his sister Maria and his father persuade him into staying. Maria is engaged to Francesco, the chief woodcutter working for Don Nicola, the richest man in the area. When the latter fires Francesco, he offers the position to Antonio, who accepts. As for Don Nicola, he becomes infatuated with Maria who, although she spurns his advances, becomes the victim of the villagers' talk, which causes her fianc√© to run afoul of her. Maria decides to leave the village and finds a job in the nearest town.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?259036</url></doc>
