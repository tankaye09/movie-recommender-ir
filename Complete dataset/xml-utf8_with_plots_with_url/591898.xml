<plot>The scene is laid in the boudoir of a pretty maiden, who is seen in her bed fast asleep. She is a somnambulist. Rising, she lights a candle and leaves her room. We follow her through the corridor out on the roof, where she walks as though in a trance. We follow her for a full block across the roofs of the houses until she arrives at the corner, when she turns and walks on the outer edge for a few feet and, missing her footing, she is violently thrown to the ground, fifty feet below. The picture changes, and the body is seen to fall through space and land on the ground, but by the that time she is lifeless. An officer picks her up, but life is extinct. A man passing at the time assists the officer in carrying her to the hospital. Again the picture changes, and we see the maiden fast asleep in her room. Suddenly she rolls out on the floor, when she awakens and finds it but a dream, a hideous nightmare. Falling on her knees at her bedside, she prays fervently.
