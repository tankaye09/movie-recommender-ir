<plot>A negro woman is washing her three-year-old baby in a tub of water. The child seems to enjoy it until he gets some soapsuds in his eyes, when he makes some very comical facial expressions. Background shows a typical native yard and hut. (Taken on the midwinter cruise of the S.S. "Prinzessin Victoria Luise" of the Hamburg-American Line.)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390736</url></doc>
