<plot>The visual footage is of a locked off shot of a view looking out to sea through a window in a house situated on a hillside in Anglesey. Over a period of 24 hours, every two hours, eight minutes of film was taken. This was then transferred to a computer and edited down to fifteen minutes in length; the result is a continually changing landscape, the progression of change being barely discernibly. (similar to watching the minute hand on a clock)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?240042</url></doc>
