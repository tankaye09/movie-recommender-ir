<plot>This riveting documentary, narrated by Danny Glover, draws viewers into the public fight to stop the execution of Joe Amrine, a Missouri man on death row for 17 years for a prison murder, despite there being neither witnesses nor evidence against him. This documentary traces advocate efforts to save Joe's life; the production and exhibition of Unreasonable Doubt: The Joe Amrine Story (a video documentary about Joe's case, trial, and torturous limbo); the public relations battle to attract attention to Joe's plight; and the precedent-setting Supreme Court case that resulted from the admirable efforts of an excellent and conscientious defense team. Influenced by "Thin Blue Line" (Errol Morris) with cinema verite qualities of "Bowling for Columbine," this documentary reveals the empowering potential of video, courageous legal representation, and the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432058</url></doc>
