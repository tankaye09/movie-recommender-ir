<plot>While multi-millionaire Mr. Saxena is busy announcing the engagement of Vijay, his grandson, he, himself, is busy driving a horse-carriage, and getting into fisticuffs with hoodlums. Vijay is quite unhappy with his grandpa about his engagement with Hong Kong returned Aarti Verma, the only daughter of wealthy magnate Roshanlal Verma. For Vijay is in love with an unknown young woman he saw at the airport. Unable to get her out of his mind, he is thrilled when he gets to meet her again in Srinagar and finally finds out that she is his tour guide, Sona Mathur. After a few misunderstandings, Sona too falls in love with him. Then things change unexpectedly after they meet with an accident, whereby Vijay temporarily loses the use of his legs. When he limps over to Sona's room, he is told that she has been discharged. And the person she has been discharged with is a young man by the name of Kamal - who is also in love with Sona. Vijay must now find out why Sona has deserted him, and if at all Kamal is the reason behind this desertion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152987</url></doc>
