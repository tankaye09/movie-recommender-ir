<plot>An artist finishes a painting which contains a world within itself. The world is that of a lonely renaissance man who remains chained to the memory of someone long gone. To overcome his solitude he orders an 'Insti-kid' (child in a box) kit and creates a child of his very own. Through a series of lessons, the child learns key bits of knowledge. The child eventually realizes there is a much larger world to explore and the man cannot deny his child these experiences. Through this release, the man comes to terms with his own self-imposed imprisonment and enters the world himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547971</url></doc>
