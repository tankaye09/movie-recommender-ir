<plot>"Look Away: A Tale from Salem" is a story of a young woman who seeks answers to the disappearance of her soul mate and miscarried child by channeling a spirit. Missy Proctor is a descendant of the infamous Elizabeth Proctor from Salem Village. In 1692 Elizabeth was convicted of witchcraft and received the punishment of death. However, Elizabeth was pregnant at the time of her scheduled execution, which saved her from the gallows. Once, she delivered her child the witch hunt had been halted. Although Elizabeth was exonerated from the crimes of conducting witchcraft "Look Away: A Tale from Salem" presents the possibility she was a practicing witch. Further, the Proctor family had been suspected of witchcraft throughout several generations. Missy calls upon Ms. Proctor to get her baby back and find the lost love of her life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341213</url></doc>
