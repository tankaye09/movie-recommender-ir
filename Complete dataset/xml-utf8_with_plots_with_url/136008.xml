<plot>John Wilson rushes out to make an important phone call to his brother who is a permanent fixture at a local lunatic asylum. The nurse will not put the phone call through to his brother because of his present psychotic condition so she tells John to come to the facility. When he arrives Dr. Thweeb greets him and being a little unstable himself, takes John on an unanticipated adventure across continents. They finally arrive at their destination, which is the same asylum they left. When John demands to see his brother, a comedy of the deluded minds breaks out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?136008</url></doc>
