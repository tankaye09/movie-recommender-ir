<plot>Tree surgeon fox arrives in a forest, examining each tree to see which ones are "up to standard". Most pass but the crow's tree home is the most sorry and dilapidated tree in the whole forest. The fox decides to repair and "beautify" the tree (starting by filling in all the holes) but the crow is content with his home just the way it is and tries to eject this intruder. First the crow raises the fox's ladder until he falls from a great height and gets the fox's head incased in cement which he "helpfully" tries to free the fox of. The fox eventually frees himself then chases the crow with an axe destroying the entire forest in the process!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617185</url></doc>
