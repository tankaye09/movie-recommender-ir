<plot>Two friends, Paul and Gates, set off for a hike to the ancient temples of Cambodia. Along the way, Paul's navigation becomes questioned when the two find themselves in the middle of a minefield, not sure whether its a genuine threat or just a remnant of the Khmer Rouge. With the stresses of life threatening disaster in front of them, their real human problems surface and they find themselves far more involved in their world back home than the danger right in front of them. Now there is only way out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476302</url></doc>
