<plot>Based on over 700 interviews in Mexican towns where half the population has left to work in the United States, The Other Side of Immigration asks why so many Mexicans come to the U.S. illegally and what happens to the families and communities they leave behind. Through an approach that is both subtle and thought-provoking, director Roy Germano provides a perspective on undocumented immigration rarely witnessed by American eyes, challenging audiences to imagine more creative and effective solutions to our illegal immigration problem.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580843</url></doc>
