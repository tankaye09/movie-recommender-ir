<plot>Dhaneshwar Pitamber (Kader Khan), has four daughters. All the four daughters are not ready to marry, each one having their own reason. The daughters always play mischievous tricks on the one coming with a proposal of marriage, and their gang leader is the youngest daughter Durga (Twinkle Khanna). Kader Khan is so desperate to get his daughters married that he is ready to give a dowry of five crores to each son-in-law. Raja (Govinda) and Kanahaiya (Johnny Lever) are small time con men at the airport. Raju Patel (Ali Asgar) is an NRI from America who comes to India to get married to one of the daughters of Dhaneshwar. Raja and Dhaneshwar mistake Raja as Raju Patel and take him home. In order to get five crores Raja solves the problems of the daughters and makes them ready for getting married. How Raja solves the daughter's problems forms the crux of the story. Ashish Vidyarthi as a don obsessed in becoming a villain in films, plays a key character in the whole story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279359</url></doc>
