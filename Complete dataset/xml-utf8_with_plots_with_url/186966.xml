<plot>The film industry is scrutinized as never before in FLMKR, a new feature from Dallas-based GutsyFilms. Written and Directed by African-American veteran independent filmmaker John Carstarphen and Produced by Rebecca Rice, FLMKR is a brash, sexy, controversial look at how films get made--or don't get made, and why. Carstarphen and Rice have designed a surreal meditation on the film industry, one as loopy and bizarre as the industry itself. FLMKR doesn't simply examine the process of making a film. It explores the agonies of creative endeavor from personal compromises, to the concessions required of an entertainment-addicted society; all seen through the eyes of one paranoid filmmaker, living and working in the heart of the "conspiracy capital of the world", Dallas, Texas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186966</url></doc>
