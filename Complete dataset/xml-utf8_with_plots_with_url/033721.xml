<plot>Nandkishore Sharma alias Nandu is born in the Sharma family. His mother tragically passes away, leaving him in the care of his father who decides to re-marry a woman named Kamla. Kamla is not very kind to Nandu, who then seeks love and solace with a neighbor named Pushpa, who looks after him, feeds him, and even sings lullabies to get him to sleep. This does not auger well with Kamla, who severely beats up Nandu whenever she finds out that he has gone to meet Pushpa. Then his parents decide to move to another town, and Nandu tearfully bids farewell to Pushpa, but her love for him remains in his heart forever. Years later, Nandu has grown up, his parents have passed away, his siblings are settled independently, and he himself is married. He takes a nostalgic journey to the same town where he used to reside as a child, and rents a room in the same locality. He asks around for a woman named Pushpa, hoping that a lot of people would remember her for her kindness and love. He is shocked to find out that Pushpa not longer lives there - and no one remembers her for her love and compassion only as a - prostitute.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033721</url></doc>
