<plot>"The Filipinos execute a flank movement and re-occupy the trenches, cutting off the advance guard of Americans. The rebel flag waves over the ditch and they defend their positions bravely. A fierce charge by our soldiers makes them give way and they scatter in all directions. The officer in command pays dearly for his desperate sortie. Just as his horse clears the embankment the officer throws up his hands and falls backward with a crash; while the rider-less horse dashes off toward the American lines. Full of exciting action and excellent detail."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093891</url></doc>
