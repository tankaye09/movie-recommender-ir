<plot>Music was what defined Tom Nash until a rare and deadly disease cost him his arms, legs, almost two years of his life, but not his will to live. The documentary gives insight into Tom's remarkable recovery and the start of his new life. It's the story of resilience, true friendship and great music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458533</url></doc>
