<plot>Yogeshwar Nath has three sons, Dina, Shree and Pitambar. He was disappointed with Dina and Pitambar and willed everything over to his son, Shree. After making this will, Yogeshwar had a change of heart, changed his will, and left everything to Dina and Pitambar. Shree finds out about this will and keeps it with Rai Bahadur Jankinath. But when Jankinath gets killed, the police get involved and suspect Shree had committed this crime. When they arrive to arrest him, they find him dead with a knife stuck in his chest. Shree's entire household is suspect as his Manager was suspected of embezzling money; he did not get along with his doctor; his nurse, Shobha, wanted to steal something from his safe; his now crippled brother, Dina, wanted a share of the family wealth; Lily, a cabaret dancer, who knows more than she claims she does; a purportedly deaf and dumb servant who can hear and talk; The case is brought before Private Investigator, Rajesh Nath, who himself becomes a target of a mysterious being clad in dark clothing, lurking in this spacious mansion that was known to be haunted at one time. The question remains will Rajesh and the police be able to solve this case, before more people are killed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043911</url></doc>
