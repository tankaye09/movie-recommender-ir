<plot>Paid sex only works when it's anonymous. Confessions of a Peepshow Junkie is about two sad and lonely people connecting with each other through a wall of "stained" glass. Mr. Coleman is a father in the midst of a mid-life crisis who has a habit of taking personal time in a North Hollywood Peepshow Booth. However, an increasingly normal routine takes a turn of the unexpected kind when he recognizes the woman behind the glass as the babysitter he hires to watch his kids. Imprisoned now by the ticking clock of a timed shade, Mr. Coleman fights to protect his anonymity, but in doing so realizes that this confessional is the only thing that can save him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113822</url></doc>
