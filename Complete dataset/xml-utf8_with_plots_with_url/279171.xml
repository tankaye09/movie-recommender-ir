<plot>"Jones feels the need of assistance to get home and finds a friend to help him. They are two of a kind. They come down the snow covered pathway, stopping frequently to sample a large flask. They finally stick their canes into a snow bank, and between them finish the whiskey. Just then a policeman appears, with blood in his eye. The two happy ones are too much for the officer, and after a short tussle he is thrown down into the deep snow. Jones staggers away, leaving his friend to fight it out. He and the officer have a very exciting rough and tumble fight in the snow. Jones comes to the rescue and the policeman gives up the job."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279171</url></doc>
