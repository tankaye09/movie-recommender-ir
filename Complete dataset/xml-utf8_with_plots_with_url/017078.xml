<plot>This is probably the most spectacular of the three Automobile race pictures. [The others are: AT TERRIFIC SPEED and START OF THE GORDON-BENNET CUP RACE.] In the first half the machines are seen going at their highest speed, at least 70, and in some cases 80 miles an hour, so fast indeed that the spectators keep away back from the road to avoid danger. In the second half the machines are seen running even at higher speed beneath an arch over which is the grand stand of the Automobile Club of England. Here there is a large group viewing the races and there is a corresponding amount of enthusiasm. This film is also most excellent photographically, the cars being shown sharp and clear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017078</url></doc>
