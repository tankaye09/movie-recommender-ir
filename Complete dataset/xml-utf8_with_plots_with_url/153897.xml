<plot>A question as old as the human race: what happens to us after death? I, the filmmaker Daniel Lang, have found the answer as it were! This film shows my early demise during a trip to Calcutta, India. I die and am reincarnated. As a dog - a street dog to be exact! And to make it even worse: I hate dogs!? "I wanted to make a humorous film in India. I did not want to show the pictures of hungry, begging children for the hundredth time. Nevertheless poverty is a defining part of India, which cannot be ignored - especially by the Western eyes of a foreigner. I hope that by using the comic and absurd elements in the film I have managed to show the often harsh reality of life in Calcutta." Daniel Lang Dog is part of a project by Rosa von Praunheim from the Film and Television School 'Konrad Wolf', with support from Barbara HÃ¤be of ARTE.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153897</url></doc>
