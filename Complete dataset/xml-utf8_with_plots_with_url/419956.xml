<plot>On the shore at Waikiki, Harry Owens leads his orchestra through five of his own compositions, as couples dance on the sand. Waiters pour drinks, the Royal Hawaiian Hula Girls perform, and Cliff Edwards does a bit of singing, as does a tenor and a quartet. We see surfers and men in small swift canoes. Owens introduces a new composition, "O-Ko-Le Ma-Lu-Na," people talk about the meaning of "aloha," there's some comic byplay between the orchestra's tunes, and Cliff plays the uke. His critics toss him in a cauldron. The short ends with a romantic ballad and a kiss upon the shore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419956</url></doc>
