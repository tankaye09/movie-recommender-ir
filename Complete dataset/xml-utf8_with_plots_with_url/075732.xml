<plot>Deceit, long kept secrets, and grisly murders surrounded in mystery - all this and more can be found in Bloodbath in the House of Knives. What starts as a harmless visit to a hypnosis demonstration turns into a roller coaster ride filled with dead bodies that start to pile up around poor Ivy. What can be the true meaning of all this? Who would be capable of such crimes? Could it have anything to do with Ivy's past relationship with sleazy pornographer and drug dealer Nick Lemenza and the secret he's been holding over her head? Maybe it has something to do with her sister Violet, and what really is their current relationship? What about the Hypnotist who started this whole mess? Does he have something to do with it? What does Ivy's lawyer Mr. Delgardo make of it all? Or will he soon end up in a body bag like so many others have? Join Ivy and her ever dwindling group of friends and family members as she realizes she is on a terrible journey that won't end! Or, will it finally end, but with her very own life?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075732</url></doc>
