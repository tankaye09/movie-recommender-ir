<plot>Peter Drake meets and falls in love with Jackie Swazey, the daughter of a feisty suffragette and incipient politician. In order to impress her, he agrees to help Mrs Swazey in her campaign to become elected. His first task is a difficult one - Mrs Swazey's ticket is Prohibition, and her husband, Jackie's Pa, is little more than a drunk. Instead of reforming him, Peter gets on with Pa Swazey like a house on fire, and they end up drunk and in jail! Fortunately the are helped out by a man named Mike Clancey. Unfortunately, he is Mrs Swazey's main opponent in the election - and the price he demands for his help is her elimination from the race. Peter comes up with the perfect solution: he spikes her drink at a Prohibition rally and gets her drunk! Before she sobers up and the sparks fly, Jackie and Peter elope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083307</url></doc>
