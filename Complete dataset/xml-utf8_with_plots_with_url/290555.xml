<plot>Pok is a young man who learns the art of Thai shadow play from his father and grows up to become a respectable shadow player. His love for the art is as immense as his love for Payom, the daughter of a local aristocrat. But Pok's love suffers a blow because Payom's father despises his profession as a lowly artist, and forces Payom to marry another rich man. Struck with rage and grief, Pok decides to embark on a final move that will unite him with his lover.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290555</url></doc>
