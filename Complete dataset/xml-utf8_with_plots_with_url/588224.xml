<plot>From sundown on Friday until dusk on Saturday, Jews cherish Shabbat as a sanctuary from the stresses and strains of the working week, a legacy passed from one generation to the next, and a symbol of their enduring strength. The Sabbath Bride follows the order of a traditional Shabbat, from lighting the candles on Friday evening to the Havdalah service after dusk on Saturday night. Mixing chicken soup and cholent with music, myths and interviews with rabbis and members of Orthodox, Reform, Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities, The Sabbath Bride is a vivid celebration of the passion and humor, vigor and diversity of Jewish life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?588224</url></doc>
