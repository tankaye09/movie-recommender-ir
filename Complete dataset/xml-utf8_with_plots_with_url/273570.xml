<plot>An Architect by profession, Sunil lives a wealthy lifestyle with his mom and dad in a city in India. His firm undertakes a project in distant Rajgarh, and he travels there with his friend, Prakash. Enroute their vehicle breaks down and they take shelter in a mansion which is occupied by a watchman/caretaker. Once inside, Sunil starts to feel as if he has been in this place before and starts to recollect his past life - a life in which he was a Range Officer named Vinay, who meets and falls in love with a village belle, Chandramukhi, much to the chagrin of her lover, Dhuman, and Yuvraj Thakur Balbir Singh, who lusts after her. The story unfolds resulting in the tragic death of Chandramukhi. Watch what happens when Sunil starts to recollect how she died, who was responsible for her death, as well as what happens now in his present life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273570</url></doc>
