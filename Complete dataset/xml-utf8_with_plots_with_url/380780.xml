<plot>Monday 14th May in San Francisco. A muffin is sold to a couple of friends who are sitting talking about a woman that the man is seeing. They don't touch the muffin and the waiter replaces it behind the counter where it is bought by a businessman in a rush. The same businessman leaves the muffin on the dash of his car as he gets oral sex from a woman who then takes the muffin when she's finished. Later the woman goes home to her live-in partner and child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380780</url></doc>
