<plot>Faten Hamama arranged with Writer Tawfik Elhakim to convert his most dramatic play to a movie. The Song of Death is a story of a mother from the countryside; her husband was killed in a brutal way. She talks to her son to have their revenge from the killers. Her son couldn't be this person who would fight or make any revenge and preferred to let the Law deals with that. The mother then treats him as a dishonorable member in the family and turns against him by arranging for his death. Later, she realizes her mistake and tries to save her son from being killed, but the song of death was completed faster than her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408005</url></doc>
