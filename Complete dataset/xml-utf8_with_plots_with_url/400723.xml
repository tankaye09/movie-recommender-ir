<plot>This is a mockumentary following the story of Mark Sherbert. At the start of the film Mark is put out by his wife of 12 months because she has fallen out of love of him. Living out of his car for a short time, Mark is not deterred by the hurts in his life by his dream of not only becoming a wrestler but also making it to the top of British Professional Wrestling circuit. However given that he is unable to take any sort of pain, has pasty skin and weighs 9 stone things do not look that good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400723</url></doc>
