<plot>It's the death of privacy when a couch potato finds out he's not the only one doing the watching. He watches weepy daytime soaps, but what he doesn't know is that the television is watching him back. When he decides to leave the television tries to ween him back with a euphoric orgy of scrambled pornography, voracious VCRs, projectile records and the unwavering light of destructive desire. He tries to turn the television off - tries to escape - but in a reality constructed of cathode images there is no escape. A horror story for Canada's isolated age of mass technology, MADE FOR TV is one that hits right at the heart of every living room in the country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350878</url></doc>
