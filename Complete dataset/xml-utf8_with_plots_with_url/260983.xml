<plot>"Respect" reflected a shift in the tone of the Civil Rights Movement. At that time, there wasn't a black woman who was prominent. So, when Aretha Franklin came along and sang, "give me some respect and here is why I deserve it" it caused women to start swinging banners. It was the soundtrack of the times. The emotion, the sound and the memories makes Respect as significant a record now as it was in 1967.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260983</url></doc>
