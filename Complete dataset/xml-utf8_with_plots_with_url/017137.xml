<plot>On the day she's laid off from her high-profile ad agency job, Alice is forced to put on a smile as the hostess of a cocktail party for her realtor husband. His three million dollar McMansion sale looks great on paper, but the deal was a bust and left him in debt. An impending storm, a dwindling guest list and an increasingly intoxicated hostess are the dubious ingredients for a cocktail party that hasn't even begun. As the evening progresses and the alcohol flows, Alice serves up some vintage specialty drinks, a plate of pot brownies and a marriage on the rocks. Just who is Alice's husband speaking with on his cell phone all evening? Is it another McMansion emergency - or something even more sadly obvious? With the help of her best friend Lauren and her pothead nephew she just might make it through the evening... or at least until she's out of pretzels.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017137</url></doc>
