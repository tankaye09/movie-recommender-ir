<plot>The successful author Erika arrives at the lake of Lugano to sell the villa of her recently passed away father. When her purse with 44,000 Franken of roulette winnings is stolen during a passage over the lake, she gets to know the ship's captain Guido. They start a passionate affair - although he's engaged with Anna and wanted to marry her in two months. None of his friends or family can understand what he's doing, but he's ready to give everything up for Erika.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335237</url></doc>
