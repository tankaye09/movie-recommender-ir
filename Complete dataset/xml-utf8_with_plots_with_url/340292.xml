<plot>An elderly man lives alone in a flat, doing crossword puzzles. He has his radio on for the fishermen's report, the weather, and an exercise program, but he always turns off the news. His breakfast is a cup of coffee, his lunch a can of soup heated directly on the stove. At 9 a.m., at 2 p.m., and sometimes in the evening, his doorbell rings: it's his neighbor asking for help with a word in her crossword puzzle. Her missing words seem to be clues to a relationship, and one day, when the doorbell doesn't ring, he must decide if he wants to fill in the blanks in his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340292</url></doc>
