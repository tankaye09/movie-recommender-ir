<plot>Eve Colman has just taken up a new job in London working for a charity and is looking for cheap accommodation in Tooting Broadway. She views a flat-share that is managed by Adam Smith who is doing temp work as a result of being made redundant from his previous job. She likes the place, and when Adam offers her room she accepts. Weeks later when she moves in she holds an informal housewarming party. This provides Adam with dark memories of his previous flatmate who socially starved him with house parties that he wasn't invited to. He painfully makes himself scarce at the party, prompting Eve to get to know him on a deeper level.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612849</url></doc>
