<plot>Who was John Arthur Geall? Who was this English writer who was born in 1914 and died in 1966 in total solitude? Why did he fascinate Orson Welles, who had planned to make a film about him in the early 70s? A two-faced personality hidden by a banal existence of an insurance clerk, Geall left an unfinished body of work, never published in his lifetime. As he is now being rediscovered in Great Britain, this film reveals for the first time the incredible life of one 20th century England's great writers as well as one of modern literature's major enigmas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278306</url></doc>
