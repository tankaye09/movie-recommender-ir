<plot>Four car-obssessed teenagers hang out in a clubhouse: two good kids: a guy with a toy car over his shoulders and his girlfriend in a yellow blue frilly jump-suit, try to reform Fast Lane, a guy with slicked up fiery red hair and a cardboard hot rod around his shoulders, who often serves as a bad influence to Couch Potato, a chubby guy in a yellow jump-suit. They had vignettes surrounding the cartoons "Rainbow Brite," "Popples," and "Ulysses 31," the latter replaced mid-season with "The Get-Along Gang."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290990</url></doc>
