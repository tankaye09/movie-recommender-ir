<plot>Tube Mice was a short lived but popular cartoon TV series from 1988 about four mice - Vernon, Toaster, Squeak and Bubble, who live at Oxford Circus Tube Station in London. They would have hilarious adventures each day and furnish their homes with odds and ends dropped by the humans passing through the station. Episodes were around five minutes long and were shown on CITV until late 1990. A video was released in 1993 but is rare now and unavailable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?620491</url></doc>
