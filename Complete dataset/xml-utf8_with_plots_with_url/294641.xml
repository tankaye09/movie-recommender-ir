<plot>The Society of Creative Anachronism (SCA) are an eclectic group of people. They come from all walks of life and gather together to learn the skills and crafts of a bygone era. The members of the SCA dress in the garb of the medieval period, including full body armour, and participate in activities ranging from combat to cookery, battles to brewing and metalwork to music. Whether it is the clash of weapons or the camaraderie that draws people to the society, the members of the SCA know how to enjoy themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294641</url></doc>
