<plot>A Supermarket Love Song is a short, character-driven drama set in contemporary London. Derrick, an 80-year-old man lives in sheltered accommodation for the elderly. Suzanne, a teenage girl who has recently been released from a young offenders institute, has been instructed to carry out some care in the community by her parole officer. In this film, she has to take this grumpy old man to the supermarket and help him with his shopping. The trip to and from the supermarket is a simple journey in which they discover each other's characters and begin to communicate. It is an enjoyable, sensitive and ultimately moving portrayal of an old man and a teenage girl. It is a love song in a minor key.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016750</url></doc>
