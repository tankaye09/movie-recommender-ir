<plot>Germany, WWII: 10-year old Dagmar has just lost her beloved twin brother Doug and her family through a bomb attack. Together with a young girl who worked in the bakery of Dagmar's parents they escape to Bavaria and find shelter at some far relatives of Dagmar's family. The little girl just doesn't feel comfortable in the strange family but soon finds a good friend: Laurent, a 17-year old French alien employee. Laurent is tormented by August, the "head of the family", but cannot defend himself because as soon as he causes a conflict he will be sent into an approved school in France which is even worse. Dagmar and Laurent become very close and become almost like brother and sister, they are all they have and Dagmar even falls a bit in love with Laurent. One day August sees how Laurent hugs Dagmar, he provokes a conflict and at the end Laurent is sent back to France. Dagmar is desperate: She thinks that she'll never sees Laurent again. 10 years later: Dagmar has stayed in the Bavarian village, August died in the meantime and Dagmar now runs his farm. An event takes place in the village: A French group visits it. One of the visitors is ... Laurent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023572</url></doc>
