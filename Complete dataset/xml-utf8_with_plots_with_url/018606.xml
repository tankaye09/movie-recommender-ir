<plot>Patsy Casey is seen reading a newspaper and imbibing in the flowing bowl while Mrs. Casey is pursuing her favorite task at the washtub. Patsy falls asleep and Mr. Casey leaves the room for a moment when the proverbially bad boy ties a string to Patsy's coat and to a piece of clothes in the tub. Mrs. Casey returns and placing the piece of clothes in the wringer proceeds to turn the crank, and Patsy is slowly but surely drawn toward the washtub until he falls over backward much to the amusement of the boy, but Patsy's discomfiture. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018606</url></doc>
