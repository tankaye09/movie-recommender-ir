<plot>Hindu saint Pujya Swamiji speaks unrehearsed from his heart about how to live joyously and truthfully while letting go of the fears and expectations that lead to unhappiness and conflict. Shot throughout India, from the sweeping peaks of the Himalayas to the small villages around Rishikesh, this stunning visual journey plays witness to his simple yet profound message: Be happy, live in the present and serve others. Rich soundtrack features renowned Indian artists Philip Glass, Ravi Shankar, Snatam Kaur, Girish and many others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009449</url></doc>
