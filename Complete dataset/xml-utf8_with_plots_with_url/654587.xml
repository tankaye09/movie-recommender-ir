<plot>This picture was taken at the historical point signified by the above title, where so many daring and venturesome miners have lost their lives in attempting to shoot these mad and turbulent rapids in their flat bottom boats, constructed for the purpose of navigating the treacherous Yukon River, which flows through the rich gold fields of Alaska. This picture was secured at the time a party of miners in a boat were making their way over one of the very rough spots. As they are tossed about by the mad current, the waves and spray are seen to dash high into the air and at times entirely envelop the eager gold seekers. This is a very realistic and exciting picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654587</url></doc>
