Amma re-locates to a shanty slum near Dharavi, Bombay, where Benwa grows up and shines shoes for a living. Amma is sexually active with Looka, a hoodlum and extortionist who shows up once in while, and also has a steady relationship with trucker, Anna. Both Looka and Anna are unaware of each other. Looka gets Benwa married to Amli from a nearby slum &amp; Anna gets Amma a much better shelter. All seems to be going well until the Police come looking for an injured Looka, when he robs a pharmacy in order to get medicines for himself.
