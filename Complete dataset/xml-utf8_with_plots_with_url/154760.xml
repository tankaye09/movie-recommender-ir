<plot>A film about music where music is only shown through the stories of those affected. How do you get your buddies to dig the same music as you do? Can you be jealous of your friends if they start liking the same artists as you do? What autographs did the artists on Swedish stages today collect when they were young? How do you dump music when you're through with it? Stories and impressions, ranging from fans who'd been standing in line for hours, to more well known music enthusiasts, e.g. Håkan Hellström, Ebbot Lundberg and Freddie Wadling.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154760</url></doc>
