<plot>Jack Ross and a group of counter terrorism CIA agents have been chasing an international terrorist for six months. Without any success. Fearing that the upcoming review of their progress, by the head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, will end their funding and their jobs, they fabricate what looks like a successful surveillance operation. To the agents, the end justifies the means. However, the 'end' is not what they had planned on.</plot><plot>Jack Ross and a group of counter terrorism CIA agents have been chasing an international terrorist for six months. Without any success.
