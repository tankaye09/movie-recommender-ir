<plot>Hopeless Rove, a tramp, meets Paulette by accident and instantly falls in love with her. Although they seem to be interested in each other, their love is challenged by Jim, who thanks to his strength both takes possession of Paulette and intimates Rove into leaving. Rove decides to devise a few ways to get rid of Jim and continue wooing Paulette: first he throws some stones at Jim, and then he persuades the obliging Paulette to drug him. Jim, however, refuses to fall victim to Rove's craftiness, although eventually he will need to succumb, so Rove and Paulette will be free to express their love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374084</url></doc>
