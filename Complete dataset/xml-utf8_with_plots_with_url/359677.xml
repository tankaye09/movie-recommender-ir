<plot>According to legend, the ghost of Captain Dockwell still haunts the decks of "Mary", forever asking his beloved ship why she collided at sea on 1942, killing him and a guest. But "Mary", floating now on just ten feet of muddy water, with most of her machinery removed, remains silent, dormant, moribund. She has not moved under her own power in years and will probably never do so again. Until one night, when the romantic troubles of another Mary energize the old ship again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?359677</url></doc>
