<plot>"Jeffrey" is a genre-busting film that deals with the paralyzing morning routine of someone with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. As he does every weekday morning, Jeffrey awakens to get ready for work in a peculiar and calculated way. Everything he does leads up to him leaving on the moment of an exact new hour. As his routine gets interrupted time and again what first seems amusing, suddenly reveals the sad darkness that lies in the troubled mind of Jeffrey.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275283</url></doc>
