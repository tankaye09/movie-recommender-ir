<plot>A tale of innocence, experience, and a handful of teeth. Tracey works nights and she knows that in her line of work the young age fast. But her fears count for little with her chaperone, Madge. A job's a job and tonight Tracey's clients must be satisfied. It's a world away from the one eight year old Sophie inhabits. She still believes in Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy. But, in the school playground Sophie's belief in the magical is challenged by older, more cynical voices. Both the little girl and the working girl must face the passing of innocence. But, as their lives touch one another in surprising ways, each learns that there's magic in experience too.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010050</url></doc>
