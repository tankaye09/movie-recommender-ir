<plot>James, a Chinese American Christian, attempts to create an academic and professional future different than what his parents expect. Due to his father's recent death, pressure is even greater for him, his sister, and his mother, who tries to keep order in their lives. While dating an English girl, doing well in school, and maintaining a good friendship with his best friend Rob, he goes through everyday life. However, after his mother finds something in his room, his true sexual identity is revealed. Everything comes crashing down at home, and his future that he has secretly begun to sort out, is put at risk. All the while, he meets Ben, causing a spark of something sweet to turn up. But, even that is put to the test. James must face cultural, religious, and familial expectations and trials in order to try to sort things out before it's too late and his future is ruined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?609679</url></doc>
