<plot>A loud subway train screeches and honks its horn as a woman screams, their visual presence an intermingled blur of metal and flesh. Henry Killington sits by himself on a relatively empty subway train. He is dressed in a traditional grey suit, a briefcase and half gift wrapped bottle of champagne in between his legs. It is his twenty eighth birthday, he dislikes birthdays almost as much as he dislikes the subway, a mode of transportation he uses based entirely on economics. He sits remembering a tragic event from his childhood, unaware that the events of the next several minutes will change his life beyond current recognition.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580821</url></doc>
