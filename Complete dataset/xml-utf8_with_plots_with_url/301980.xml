<plot>Angelo Musco leaves his small town in Sicily to go to Rome for an operation. Once there, he decides he likes that continental air and proceeds to acquire a veneer of same...and also acquires a dancer, sporting-and-claiming an even-larger dose of Continental Veneer. They return together to Sicily with Musco under the impression she comes from the continent. Leda's clothes, manners, habits and flirting ways start a small revelation-style revolution, which is not to Musco's liking. He ships Leda back to Rome, but not before learning that he has been taken in by a Scilian native, as Leda was born in a near-by town.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?301980</url></doc>
