<plot>Newly married couple, Vikas Chandra and Aarti, move into their new apartment, and are deeply in love with each other. One day they go out to watch a late night Bollywood movie "Loafer", at a cinema theatre. It's well after midnight when the movie gets over, and both are unable to find a cab to take them, so they decide to walk home. On the way, they are waylaid by four men, who assault Vikas, leaving him unconcious, and forcibly take Aarti with them. When Vikas regains his senses he finds himself in hospital with a head wound. And Aarti too is in the same hospital - after being gang-raped and assaulted. This incident makes headlines in all major newspapers, radio and television, and is also a subject of discussion by politicians during their election campaign. Vikas feels hounded and haunted by this incident, and feels that everybody is treating him differently. Aarti, on the other hand, has been traumatized, and unable to trust any male. Now this newly married couple are faced with a loveless relationship, and only a miracle can bring the old spark back into their married life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213964</url></doc>
