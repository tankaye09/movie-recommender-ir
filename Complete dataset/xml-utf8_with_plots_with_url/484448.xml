<plot>Sally Morgan, a middle-aged working-class British woman, comes to New York City to seek her fame and fortune - as a PSYCHIC. She needs the money to provide for her large family. She needs the fame to prove to everyone including herself that she is the real deal, a genuine clairvoyant. Is she or isn't she? Sometimes she wows us with her eerie accuracy, and sometimes she stuns us with her dead-on inaccuracy. Will she pass the rigorous scientific test administered by Harvard and Yale educated Dr. Gary Schwartz? Regardless of the outcome, Sally shows us that a big heart and a good sense of humor are important for dealing with life, but essential for dealing with the after life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484448</url></doc>
