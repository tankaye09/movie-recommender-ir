<plot>Bob starts his lawn mower in front of his two-story suburban house. Suddenly, he notices a small "BOB" emblem in the lower-right-hand corner of his vision. He shakes his head and rubs his eyes. It continues. He runs in the house, stares in the mirror, and applies an eye wash. Now he also sees a time and temperature box. He bangs his head on a tree limb, and a crawl appears with news about Bob. He runs to an eye clinic, but the clinician can find nothing wrong. Now, live updates are appearing on the left side of his vision. Will anything get rid of this visual plague?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385301</url></doc>
