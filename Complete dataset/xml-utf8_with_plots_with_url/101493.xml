Before that could happen, Megha Joshi enters their lives and changes everything. For Akash falls head over heels in love with her, and will do anything for her. Just when their education is about to get over, Megha disappears from Akash's life. Five years later, Akash and Reena are both qualified doctors in a reputed hospital in Bombay. It is here that Megha is admitted in the Psychiatric Ward in a very disturbed condition. She is unable to recollect anything except her last day with Akash, when both had planned to marry each other. Watch how Akash comes to term with his lost love, and promises to do his best to unravel the mystery that is Megha and her equally mysterious disappearance, and her sudden re-appearance in his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101493</url></doc>
