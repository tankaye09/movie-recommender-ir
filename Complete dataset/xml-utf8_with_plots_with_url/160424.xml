<plot>A thirty year old guy wakes up, as usual, in his flat in a big city. He drinks coffee, gets dressed and get ready to leave the flat. He listens to the radio, where countless tragic accidents, tragedies, fatalities, political scandals are mixed up with aggressive advertisements. Rafal, as usual, leaves for work, but ... in the doorway he stops, as if because of an invisible borderline. The neighbors, his girlfriend, colleagues and eventually doctors try to persuade him to leave.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160424</url></doc>
