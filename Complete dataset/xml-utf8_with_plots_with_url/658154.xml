<plot>Charles Kemper, a contest-entering nut, is engaged to be married, but his prospective father-in-law, a dour Scotsman, won't allow the wedding until he hears Kemper has won a contest. But it is called off when the company holding the contest tricks Kemper into signing a quit-claim waiver. He enters and wins another contest and the wedding takes place, but the bill-paying father-in-law is dismayed when he finds out the prize was only a tooth brush.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658154</url></doc>
