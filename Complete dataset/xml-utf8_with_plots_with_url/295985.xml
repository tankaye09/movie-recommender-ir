<plot>As Leon trudges toward his usual subway station to get to his meaningless job, he runs into the last person on Earth he'd expect to see - his old friend Vincent from college. Trying to avoid an awkward and unpleasant confrontation, Leon makes for the station. When Vincent follows him to station platform, Leon finally gives voice to his pent-up anger and bitterness. Will this unexpected encounter finally heal a long-festering wound, or will it reinforce the knowledge that this is a wound that can never heal?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?295985</url></doc>
