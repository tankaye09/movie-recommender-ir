<plot>Arthur Berkeley has a secret: his computer has just crashed, taking with it his much-anticipated novel - and he forgot to make a back-up. He and his friend Victoria, an acclaimed poet, run an independent publishing company, and they were depending on the sales of his novel to keep them in business. Arthur meets Lisa, who promises to help him become famous as a writer. Lisa and Arthur begin dating, but when Lisa's ex-boyfriend Liam shows up from New York, determined to win her back, Arthur is afraid to tell her, or anyone, the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418272</url></doc>
