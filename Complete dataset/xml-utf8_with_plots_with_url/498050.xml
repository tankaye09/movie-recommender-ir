<plot>Highlighted by endearing characters and an all original soundtrack by the hall of fame doo-wop group; The Skyliners, SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU is a tumultuous emotional landscape of family love, loss and redemption, punctuated with four decades of multi platinum sound. The story captures with unique immediacy the fallout of fractured family relationships, as seen through a child's eyes. Janet, an accomplished well known singer with The Skyliners and her overbearing husband Terry, a tough street wise cop, have driven their marriage to collapse, leaving their 3 children psychologically abandoned and confused. The story weaves an interesting mix of difficult themes -from subtleties of a parent-child relationship to the terrifying images of emotional breakdown; from the unclear, consuming desires that plague adults, to a child's keen ability to recognize the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?498050</url></doc>
