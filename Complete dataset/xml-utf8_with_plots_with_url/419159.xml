<plot>The world's air is no longer breathable. People live and work sealed from the elements within their airtight homes. Air is supplied as with other the other utilities, water and electricity. Xavier is a maintenance worker for the company that supplies the world's air, his job giving him the rare privilege of being allowed outdoors. Cut off from all human contact, yet free to wander outdoors, alone, he begins to question his role in the world, while harboring a rising suspicion that the government's tight control over its people is far more sinister than he has been taught to believe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419159</url></doc>
