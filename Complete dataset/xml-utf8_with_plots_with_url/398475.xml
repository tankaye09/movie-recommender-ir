<plot>Middle-class America supports a rich irony: its children don't have to grow up. This documentary tracks their condition as they veer between blue-collar jobs and petty criminality, anti-depressants and hard drugs, therapy-speak and violence, trying to find a way to explain themselves. In this film, we try to draw our audience into an experience of the unnoticed, unexpected, and disruptive rhythms that dominate the everyday life familiar to them. In the banal, pristine world of the suburbs, we chart the dynamics of a constant search for distraction, and record the vacillations of an energy and intelligence that can find no adequate means of expression or purpose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398475</url></doc>
