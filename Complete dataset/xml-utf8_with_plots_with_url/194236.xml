<plot>A must for any film lover, filmmaker or artist with a dream. This underground, no-holds barred documentary tells the true story of the outrageous grassroots marketing campaign to bring an independent movie to the public. It also includes honest, personal moments and insight into the lives of artists. Daron Fordham, writer, director and star of several successful independent films leads his production team headed by Raymond Forchion and Wong Cook on the road across America to promote their Polychrome Pictures/Warner Brothers release, "Confessions Of A Thug." This is the step by step, nuts and bolts, cold hard reality of what every independent filmmaker can do "after they get the deal or without any deal at all," in the fight to get their movie to the people! It's also a fun road trip and celebration of the true American Entrepreneurial Spirit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?194236</url></doc>
