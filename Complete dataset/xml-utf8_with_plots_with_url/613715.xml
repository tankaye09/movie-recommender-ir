<plot>Based on the gruesome novella Clive Barker wrote especially for Todd McFarlane's disturbing action figure line, Tortured Souls is the story of six Cenobite-like creatures: Agonistes, a transformer of people into monsters who may be a creation of God; the Scyther-Meister, an assassin created by Agonistes to bring a corrupt empire to its knees; Lucidique, the daughter of a slain senator who is strangely falling in love with the Scythe-Meister; Talisac, a twisted doctor who has impregnated and attached himself to a strange machine; Venal Anatomica, a hulking assassin with an inhuman bloodlust; and Mongroid, Talisac's soon-to-be born child with a huge mouth in his stomach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?613715</url></doc>
