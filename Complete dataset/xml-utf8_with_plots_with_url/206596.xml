<plot>"This picture shows the entire Brooklyn Bridge from end to end. The car from which the picture was taken started from the Brooklyn end and lands in the depot in New York. This picture was taken on Dewey Day, when thousands of persons were on the bridge. This is the only film on the market that shows the Bridge from one end to the other. One of the interesting features of this marvelous picture is the winding in and out of the car tracks in the New York depot."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206596</url></doc>
