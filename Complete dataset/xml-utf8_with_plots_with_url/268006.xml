<plot>Inspired by the Italo Calvino novel, "Invisible Cities", the film explores the notion of returning home. A New York-based artist struggling with success abruptly leaves the city to return to his hometown. His main goal: to find inspiration and salvation in his past. But returning home isn't quite so easy and the artist quickly finds himself unable to re-establish old connections he once hastily abandoned. A film split into 5 stories (each of which explores a different aspect his past), "Invisible Cities" is a film about loss and one person's attempt to reconcile this loss. The film is a mix of several genres and is at times funny and romantic while also exploring nightmarishly dark areas as well. In the end, the film asks this question: Once you leave home, are you ever really able to return?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268006</url></doc>
