When the girl drops her pencil, Kevin picks it up, as he gets ready to return it to her she is no longer there. As he gets off the bus he looks at the name on the pencil, which reads Tracy Donnelly. Latter that night he finds out that the house he and his family have just moved into is the old Donnelly house, it seems the Donnely's moved out because their daughter Tracy died in a school bus accident and the house held to many memories for them to stay.
