<plot>A documentary about the people who ride their motorcycles around America. Filmed during the 1996 annual biker run held at Sturgis, South Dakota, it takes a close look at some of the different types of people who ride motorbikes, showing that they're not what popular stereotypes have portrayed them to be. Among the people followed are Alex and Martin, a middle-aged couple planning to attend the festival together, Ilene, who comes from a long line of bikers, and the rough-looking "Liddo" Jim, head of a group called the Ressurection Motorcycle Club.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070323</url></doc>
