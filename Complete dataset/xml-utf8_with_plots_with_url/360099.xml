<plot>Suman Rai belongs to a wealthy family and lives in a palatial house with two brothers, Kedarnath and Sandeep. She meets and falls in love with a middle-class man named Shankar Kumar. She introduces him to her brothers, who reject him outright, and ask Suman not to see or meet him again. Instead Suman asserts herself and gets married. Enraged at this, Sandeep takes a gun to stop the marriage, a fight ensues between him and Shankar, and Sandeep gets killed. The police arrest Shankar, and bring him up before the court, which finds him not guilty. But Kedarnath has found him guilty and refuses to have to do anything with him or his sister. Suman goes to live with Shankar and his younger brother, Karan. Years later, Karan has grown up and is in love with fellow collegian, Nisha. What Karan does not know that Nisha is Kedarnath's daughter, and neither Shankar nor Kedarnath will permit them to see each other anymore, and if they do persist, there is more than a chance of history of repeating itself and someone getting killed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360099</url></doc>
