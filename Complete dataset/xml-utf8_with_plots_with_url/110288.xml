<plot>Are we evolving as a species or are we going extinct? What is consciousness? Is G-d a myth? Can science and spirituality learn to co-exist? What happens when you die? Cognition Factor stitches quick-paced conversations with Terence Mckenna into a plot to save the world, along with brother Dennis Mckenna, and Ralph Abraham, Rupert Sheldrake, Ralph Metzner, Alex Grey, and twenty more of the top thinkers of our times. The narrated documentary moves through five different scenarios, each accompanied by a distinctive visual and audio style.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110288</url></doc>
