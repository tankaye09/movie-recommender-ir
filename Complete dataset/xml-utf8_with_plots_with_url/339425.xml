<plot>In the early 80s, director Patrick Jackson, while still a child, traveled to Libya with his family. There they recorded memories on super 8 footage, which was stored away. In this experimental short documentary, Jackson revisits the footage to discover his mother: a young woman sun drenched and in the blush of youth. Suddenly, the footage is literally fast-forwarded to present day wintry Sweden. The woman in the earlier footage has aged nearly 30 years. Set to a haunting track by eclectic musician Franz Kirmann, this short film captures what it is to time trip through memory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339425</url></doc>
