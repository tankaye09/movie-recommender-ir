<plot>A few years ago, my landlord in Brooklyn was an old Spanish woman who was more than a bit senile. In fact, Mrs. Alvarado was crazy. The old lady would always forget who I was, or that I lived in the building (which was odd considering I lived in the same apartment for eight years.) One time, she even had the cojones to block me and this girl from going into my apartment. As you can imagine, I dreaded running into this woman. But then one day, that all changed when she suddenly remembered who I was. She had asked me if I could buy her a Chipwich. A what? A Chipwich. Again, I considered this odd, especially because it was the middle of winter and she was sitting outside on her lawn chair. Like I said, she was crazy. It was also the last time she would bother me. And this my friends, is where my story ends and the movie begins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193684</url></doc>
