<plot>A Republican author of erotic novels. A gay couple approaching their 36th anniversary. An actress who never became a star but always worked. Directors Ilona and Lane Siller listen to seven elderly New Yorkers (aged like fine wine) as they talk about love, work, politics, the miseries of aging, and the YMCA swimming class that they all attend. Very different people, but they all feel they've lived their lives to the fullest and plan to continue doing so.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135134</url></doc>
