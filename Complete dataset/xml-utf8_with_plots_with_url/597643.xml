<plot>This film is constructed of series of surreal poetic episodes that take place in the dreams of a sleeping man. The piece involves abstractions on love, romance and the conflict between internal and external realities; existence and death, and the question of possibilities. The imagery in the film expresses these concepts through dreamy sequences edited in such a way to reflect the transient meanings in poetry. The film visualizes the connections between memories, fantasies, expectations and the failures of an individual as he sleeps. The film breaks the rules of traditional narrative structures in cinema, and aims to establish a revolutionary approach that reveals the vast potentials of the mind. It re-invents the visionary aesthetics of the early days of cinema, in the digital age.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597643</url></doc>
