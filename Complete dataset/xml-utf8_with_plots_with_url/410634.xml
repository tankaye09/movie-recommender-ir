<plot>Two men trying to find themselves in the midst of WWII Germany. This tale is not about the war that rages around them, but the struggle inside the heart. Lieutenant John Delay, bitter about war and his estranged wife back home, has given up on life. Private John Fisher, young and full of life, sees the inner conflict in his commanding officer and reaches out to him. Can young Fisher help a lost man find himself before it's too late? Is it ever too late to right one's wrongs? Are there any coincidences? Do we cross paths with people in life for a reason?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410634</url></doc>
