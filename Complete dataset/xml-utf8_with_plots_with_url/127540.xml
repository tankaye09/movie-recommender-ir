<plot>Raja (Bhagyaraj) is the son of the watchman at an Ooty bungalow. The owner is a rich industrialist, whose daugther Radha (Poornima Jayaram) was best friends with Raja back when they were in school together. Years later, Radha returns to Ooty after having studied and lived abroad. Raja is still in love with her, but she remembers him as just as the watchman's son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127540</url></doc>
