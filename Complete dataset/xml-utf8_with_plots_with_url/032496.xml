<plot>Amy Helix and her younger sister Maddie grieve at the funeral of their late mother. A day later, Amy is back to her usual self-except for the nightmarish, faceless figures that now haunt her sleepless nights. Maddie's concern for Amy grows as she finds out about Amy's insomnia, but Amy is convinced these figures are just figments of her imagination. Her fiercely independent nature backfires, however, when she forcefully refuses Maddie's help. Is Amy strong enough to banish her bogeymen? Or will her nightmares just keep multiplying.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032496</url></doc>
