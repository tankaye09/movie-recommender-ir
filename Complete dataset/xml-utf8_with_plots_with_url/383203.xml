<plot>"My African Giraffe" tells the story of Adam, a seemingly well meaning boy who is in search of that extra little gift from his grandmother. His journey takes him to his grandmother's house where he startles his grandmother by showing up without his mother. What Grandma doesn't know is that she is in for a lot more than she bargained for. Along the way this dark fable touches on the notions of greed and materialism in contemporary society while showing us Grandma's emotional and financial bankruptcy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383203</url></doc>
