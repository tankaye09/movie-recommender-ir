<plot>Although the Hervey oil company is nearly bankrupt, owner Bill Hervey is unconcerned because he is about to be married to Helen Gray and can think of nothing else. One day, while visiting his newly purchased home in the suburbs, he meets his neighbor, newlywed Annabelle Eaton, who asks Bill for a ride to a nearby chicken farm. Bill agrees, but when they reach the farm, they are locked in a room by a lunatic and forced to remain there overnight. When they finally escape the next day, the two are hard-pressed to explain to their respective mates where they have spent the night, until a doctor comes along and explains that the lunatic was his patient and that he will pay damages for their inconvenience. With this satisfactory explanation, the couples are reconciled, and the damages Bill collects save his company.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184492</url></doc>
