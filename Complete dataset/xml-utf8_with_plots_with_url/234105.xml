<plot>In the second year of the Republic of China, Shanghai is a prosperous city, full of rich businessmen - and their respective bodyguards. One of these, Tih Wu Ching, is a murderer who later, repents and abandons his low life. Yu Chiang and Yu Chin, brother and sister of the man he killed, are after him, although they only know his nickname, rather common: Chief Wang. The brother and sister team come across different Wangs, who give them trouble and fights. Yu Chin ends up by finding and fighting the real Wang she had been looking for. The girl seriously wounds the man, who gives her the name of the man who actually killed her brother Kao Yu Wei, following the orders of their rich boss. She goes after the man - Siao, a man she had reasons to trust before.
