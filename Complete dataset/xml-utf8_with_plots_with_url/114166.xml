<plot>Utilizing the same footage from their 1939 short with the same title in which the studio's newsreel sports commentator Paul Douglas (prior to his days as an actor)told the story of the Oregon filling-station attendant, Buzz Holstrom, who was the first man to navigate the 1100 miles of the Colorado River alone and in a home-made boat. This 20th Century-Fox Sport Show (company production number 2201)cuts a couple of minutes from the original and utilizes the current voice of the sports segment of their newsreel department, Mel Allen, who was also the radio voice of the New York Yankees basball team.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114166</url></doc>
