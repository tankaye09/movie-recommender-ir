<plot>This amusing picture opens by bringing into view a young lady seated on a bench near a park lake. Her policeman lover appears on the scene and begins to caress her in a most affectionate manner, in spite of the sign prohibiting courting in the park. A couple of fellow officers see their comrade breaking the law, and take the law in their own hands by throwing the couple into the lake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?437739</url></doc>
