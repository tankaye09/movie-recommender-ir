<plot>Mama Black Widow is the portrait of a black family's migration from the southern Mississippi fields of the segregated south to the ghettoized black underworld of Chicago during the 1930's. The story follows Otis Tilson's struggle to keep his family together as they navigate through a world of alcoholism, pimping, sexual deviation and racial degradation. Told in the gut level language of the original novel by Iceberg Slim, the family's journey is a harsh testament of lives lived on the margins of a racist and predatory world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354723</url></doc>
