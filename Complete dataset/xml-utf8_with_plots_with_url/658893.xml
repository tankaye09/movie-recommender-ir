<plot>In Ghana, women accused of witchcraft are torn from their families and banished to isolated "witch villages." This film follows accused witches through their daily struggle to survive in the Kukuo Witches Camp in Northern Ghana. As government agencies attempt to abolish this age-old tradition, these women find themselves caught between their society's deeply rooted beliefs and its drive toward modernization. WITCHES IN EXILE captures a country at a dramatic and emotional crossroads.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658893</url></doc>
