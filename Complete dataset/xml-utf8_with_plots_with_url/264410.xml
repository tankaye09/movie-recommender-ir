<plot>Our photographers arranged with the Indians to ride at breakneck pace toward the camera but he didn't realize that the Indians would try to run over him. This picture is a great subject and sure to win. It shows the Reds off to great advantage and will be appreciated by any person who likes horses and clever riding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264410</url></doc>
