<plot>Boston-born Scott Rosenberg burst onto the scene in 1995 with his hard-boiled screenplay for Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead. His repertoire crosses the film spectrum with indie films like Beautiful Girls to the big-budget studio pictures Gone in 60 Seconds and Con Air. His adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel High Fidelity garnered him a WGA Award nomination and he is frequently called in for his skills as a script doctor. In this interview, Rosenberg candidly reveals his tools of the trade, from the inspiration of a Metallica album to his "intoxicating" recipe for overcoming writer's block. He explains how being a Red Sox fan prepared him for life as a screenwriter, why no one is more brilliant than Winnie the Pooh, and what happened that infamous night at a bar in North Carolina.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553281</url></doc>
