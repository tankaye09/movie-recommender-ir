<plot>This compelling documentary features a young woman, formerly an adolescent smoker. Although smoking for only six years, Meghan chronicles the physical and psychological impact smoking had on her early life. She describes her intense and prolonged struggles with quitting and speaks with other young people about this powerful and life-threatening addiction. We hope that her story will influence other young people when they are faced with the decision to initiate smoking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252189</url></doc>
