<plot>No man who commits evil against another walks away free, no matter what the reward may seem to be. On the 1880's western frontier, crimes against immigrants were so rampant that a horrific mass murder went overlooked. Legend has it that a family of mine owners destroyed their mines with immigrant workers trapped inside to avoid having to pay them. Story goes that the McLeary's got away with this crime rich men, never to be heard from again. Legend has it wrong. This is the shocking story of the fate that befell the men who committed this unforgivable atrocity against humanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570611</url></doc>
