<plot>Finding some hand-made film magazines at home, Robin Mitchell learns about a film that his father starred in and produced in 1943. With his father too ill to tell him about it, he embarks on a search that leads him to the film and to the home of its director Robert Edwards. In a revealing interview, Robert Edwards talks about his lifelong passion for films and tells the story behind the film's production by a small group of enthusiasts in Fife. Robin eventually reunites the filmmakers at an emotional 60th anniversary screening of the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039041</url></doc>
