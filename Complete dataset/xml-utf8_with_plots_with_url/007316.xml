<plot>Lee Bruce is trying to get into Berkeley but there's just one problem: His teacher has just assigned a critical thinking paper on random events for him to write. First off, nothing ever random happens in the predictable life of Lee Bruce. Secondly, he sucks at English. It's the night before the paper is due and Lee has wasted away most of his time in the library. Suddenly, a book drops on the ground from a dark bookshelf. A strange figure appears, and Lee will quickly learn that random events can come in the form of a figure; one who dons a red and white striped shirt.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007316</url></doc>
