<plot>Among many other reasons, with a horse named Salvador Dali as his best friend, Dennis Wilson isn't your average student. Dennis is frequently seen as odd. He doesn't look like the other kids, or tend to fit in with the popular kids at school. Despite his incredible ability, even his father ridicules his love and obsession with Painting his life away. Dennis becomes infatuated with escaping reality by Painting a series of fantasy sequences manifesting the future of his love interest, Sarah Krenshaw.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581232</url></doc>
