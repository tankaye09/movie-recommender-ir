<plot>Life is defined by choices. Being them, voluntary, imposed, circumstantial, or eventual. It is the case of this family that has to decide the path for their worst deepest life dilemmas. Not always is easy to find the problem's solution. Chose to marry the woman the loved woman against the family non-approval. Judge people, not for what they appear to be, but for what they really are. Mold a personal and professional image for a society with an old way of thinking. Believe in icons to a point of not experience our own personality. Decide to have a baby to save a marriage. Decide for our self's and not for the others. Maintain happiness through lies or live with the painful truth. Chose hate instead of love. Chose between a life or another. Live or die. This comes from the different contrasts of the choices that the characters will be confronted with.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009988</url></doc>
