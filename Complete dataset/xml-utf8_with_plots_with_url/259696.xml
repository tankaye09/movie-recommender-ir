<plot>The journey of a ball trying to find a home. It travels sadly alone after being tossed aside by its owner who saw it as garbage, but like the old saying, "One man's trash is another man's treasure." A young boy finds the ball and takes it with him. You then witness how even the little thing in life can lead to great things. The moral of the story being, "It's not where you take things from...it's where you take them to."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?259696</url></doc>
