<plot>A most popular subject and one that will please the ladies and children. It is full of action. The [black people] who take part evidently enjoy themselves, and the film cannot fail to amuse any audience. While the congregation is in prayer the parson is seen to drink from the proverbial "black bottle," and being detected in the act by one of his flock, he is compelled to share it with him. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212763</url></doc>
