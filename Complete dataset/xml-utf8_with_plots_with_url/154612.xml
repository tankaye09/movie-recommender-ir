<plot>Dolly Parton rapidly rose to fame during the 1970s with her memorable country hits, including solo efforts and numerous duets with Porter Wagoner; she had earlier worked as Wagoner's featured singer on his TV series. "Dolly" was Parton's first solo TV effort, featuring a mix of country and popular music and comedy sketches. The show was only semi-successful in first-run syndication; however, "Dolly" would be repeated for many years (in syndication and later, cable) as Parton's star power rose exponentially in the late 1970s, with sold out concerts, starring movie roles and million-selling singles that charted on Billboard magazine's country singles and Hot 100 charts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154612</url></doc>
