<plot>Cardio Striptease was created by fitness sensation "Jeff Costa" in Crunch Gym in Hollywood. Many that have trained with Mr. Costa have copied the program from the master, but they were unable to capture his magic. The Cardio Striptease 4 disc DVD series introduces you to the art of striptease. Jeff takes the most popular techniques from art of striptease and puts them into a aerobic workout that conditions and strengthens the hips, thighs, buns and abs. Cardio Striptease helps you lose weight and look good in the comfort of your own home! Cardio Striptease has its own music CD that comes with the program.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?094218</url></doc>
