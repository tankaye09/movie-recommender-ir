<plot>This movie was made for the 48 hour Toronto Film Challenge. Each team was given 4 parameters to implement in a movie - location, prop, crisis and a genre. In our case they were: roller-coaster, toy raccoon, gum in hair and coming of age. We wrote-shot-edited-delivered it within 2 days of time since we got our parameters. In 6 minutes of time we made people laugh 13 times, as it was carefully counted by our camera man Jonah Hart during screening.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025463</url></doc>
