<plot>The 1946/1947 murder trial of young and beautiful Evelyn Dick remains the most lurid murder case in Canadian history. After children find only the torso of her missing husband, John, Evelyn is arrested for his murder. The head and limbs had been sawed from his body and evidence that they had been burned in the furnace of her home (she and her adolescent daughter shared with her parents) later surfaced. (There is some weird twist involving her parents and a supposed baby boy that she gave up for adoption some 3 years prior to the murder.) After she was sentenced to hang, lawyer J.J. Robinette appealed her case, and won an eventual acquittal. But, when police are tipped-off by her father, the decayed remains of Evelyn's baby boy encased in cement under the floor boards of her home are found. Although she is acquitted of the murder of her husband, she is sentenced to 11 years in prison for the murder of her infant son. No one was ever convicted of the murder of John Dick. Evelyn was released from prison in 1958. After her release, her whereabouts were never known or at least never reported or published.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?613650</url></doc>
