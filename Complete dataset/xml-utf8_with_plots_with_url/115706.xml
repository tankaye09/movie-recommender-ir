<plot>Doc prepares Champ for a comeback in the boxing ring when the punching bag breaks. Upon repairing it, Doc mistakingly drops the hammer on Champ's foot causing him to throw a painful fit. A beatnik notices his "dance" and offers them money if they will play at his bar. Champ is a hit there too so Doc and Champ keep going up and up with their "act" until Champ complains that his feet are hurting. Just when they about to perform the greatest act of all at Carnegie Hall, Champ walks off the stage.
