<plot>'At Last' is the story of a group of friends, young professionals in Los Angeles, who come together at the Denali's house for a spring dinner party. Each of the guests is aware that their hostess, the young and talented Anya is losing her fight against cancer and that this may be the last time any of them will see her. It is the silence, the yearning of each of the characters, musing that the grass is always greener, that one of the others has the life they desire, that speaks loudest. Paul, an ambitious architect, is in awe of legendary designer Alan Spencer and yearns for his success and prestige. Mario Denali is jealous of the ease that Anya has while around her old friend Tim. Everyone longs for Anya's grace and power and Anya quietly wishes that she had the hope of any of them. The mood, though, is expansive and celebratory until the breathless climax when the air seems to be sucked out of the room and everyone is left thinking of themselves and what is important to them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049509</url></doc>
