<plot>Bombay Police are baffled when several women of lose moral, bar girls, and prostitutes are found brutally murdered by a scalpel. The Police would like to assign this case to Inspector Shirke, however, Sub-Inspector Sujata Deshmukh insists that she can solve these murders with the help of her senior, Inspector Rohan Sethi. The matter is re-assigned to both of them and they soon become involved in this investigation. They are approached by a popular singer/dancer, Divya Varma, who claims to have visions of women getting killed. Divya is initially scoffed at, but when the murders really occur, her story gets a second look. After another murder at the Samurai Club, the Police find that they have a suspect named Jagdish, who also happens to be Divya's alcoholic paternal uncle. Despite of Divya's protests, Jagdish is arrested and held in a cell. Then Divya starts getting visions of her very own murder, leaving the question unanswered as to who the real killer is, and whether she/he will succeed in getting away with Divya's murder also.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391643</url></doc>
