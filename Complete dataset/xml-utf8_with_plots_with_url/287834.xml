<plot>Kate &amp; Co., a farcical look at Corporate America. Kate &amp; Co. "Even in a small town, there's room for everyone." Everyone in Bristol knows good-hearted Kate as a long lost relative trying to make a new start by opening a 'mom &amp; pops' style coffee shop in this franchise free small town. She quilts herself into the fabric of this esoteric community by befriending the locals with homespun stories of a fictitious past, but a 'dark' secret brews in her house of 'carbs.' Would the town approve if they knew her true identity as the front-woman for Organic Hearth, a coffee and baked goods conglomerate taking root in their back yard? When Kate begins to fall in love with the quaint little town (and Sam, the local deputy!), she wonders what life in Bristol would be like if she made all of her lies come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287834</url></doc>
