<plot>Folks are busy at the production offices of Mort Downey Jr.'s talk show. A warehouse worker is preparing manifests for shipping. He needs the sign off of the producer, a voluble woman who's talking non-stop on the phone to someone named Harry. She signs the manifest without looking up as she talks about sexual surrogates, a woman crushed to death by her fat lover, and a fist fight on Geraldo Rivera's show. "Thank goodness he's been taking boxing lessons," she says. She's interrupted by the arrival of a uniformed woman with a nose ring. The woman opens a paper bag she's carrying and hands the producer what's inside. The horror is only beginning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083241</url></doc>
