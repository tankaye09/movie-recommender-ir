<plot>Johnny Mack (Johnny Mack Brown) returns to Pony Mesa, where his friend Alibi (Max Terhune) gives him a letter from Mary (Reno Browne), granddaughter of his former boss Brimstone (Milburn Morante), asking Johnny to forget his quarrel with the old man and return and save the ranch. On the way there, Johnny shoots Steve Dallas (Kenne Duncan) after the latter kills the stagecoach driver (Bud Osborne) in a robbery attempt. The outlaw's 13-year-old brother Larry (Teddy Infuhr) accuses Johnny of killing Steve without reason, not knowing his brother was a wanted outlaw for a bank holdup. Johnny persuades Brimstone to let Larry stay at his ranch. Steve's outlaw partner, Ed Stone (Terry Frost) and his henchmen, Barstow (Marshall Reed) and Joe (Boyd Stockman), are searching for the missing bank-robbery money. Larry finds it in the lining of a coat belonging to Steve and is on his way to the sheriff (William Norton Bailey) when he is intercepted by Stone and his gang.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650912</url></doc>
