<plot>Danny's first day away from home, in the Big City. He isn't convinced by the room, not one little bit. But if he doesn't take it he may end up with nothing at all. The landlady bears down on him. Eyes him like he's food on her plate. He takes the room. Moving in with his few possessions, he starts looking for something in which he can take comfort. Begins to discover hints of who the girl living here previously may have been. From her residue, like shades of memory in the room, his mind conjours her up. Yet not all is as it seems. Furnished Room is a ghost story about beauty, warmth, loneliness and regret.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?207164</url></doc>
