<plot>Rebound: A Basketball Story is the true story of a high school basketball team that rose from literal ashes to realize a dream that no Kentucky 9th Region team has accomplished since - winning the state championship. In the fall of 1980, the small town of Independence, Kentucky was rocked by a massive gas explosion at its high school, causing millions of dollars worth of damage, dozens of injuries, and the untimely death of one of its brightest students, 16-year-old Robert Williams. But in face of adversity, a team of young men fought back. With no school to attend or gym to practice in, the Boy's Varsity Basketball team carried on with their season in an attempt to inspire their fellow students and unite the entire community. In rallying around their team, the town of Independence found a way to heal and rebuild. With unbelievable strength, they picked up the pieces of their lives and moved on the way they knew best - by playing basketball.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457527</url></doc>
