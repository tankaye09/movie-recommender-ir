<plot>Bill Farraday (Ben Alexander) and his band head for New York and have to leave their pretty band singer behind. Bill writes and tells her they have jobs in a swanky night club but fails to mention they are waiters and not hired as a band. When she shows up they dress as Russian waiters in long beards to fool her. This was reissued as an RKO Headliner short on November 23, 1945.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471164</url></doc>
