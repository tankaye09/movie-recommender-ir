<plot>Erica is a depressed, socially isolated woman in her late 30s. When an old friend, Joanne, comes back into her life after a long absence, she is eager to renew their once close connection. Joanne, however, has since outgrown her friend and is busy managing a successful career and personal life. Upset by the brush-off, Erica's desire for attention and affection is transferred instead to her friend's teenage daughter, Sophie. The girl responds with semi-flirtatious behavior, and a tentative, stilted courtship ensues. Erica is consumed with guilt, struggling with romantic feelings that are entirely inappropriate by conventional social standards. A happy resolution seems impossible and the two characters' brief relationship culminates in a thwarted sexual encounter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212526</url></doc>
