<plot>Left on an orphanage porch, Candice White (Candy for short) always longed for parents. She watched as all the other children were adopted and her friends were taken away from her. Eventually, she gets adopted, but a child to love was not what her foster parent wanted; rather, Candy is to become a playmate for her step-sister Eliza. Eliza has no intentions of being friends with a commoner, however, and together with her brother they have made it their job to make Candy as miserable as possible.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092779</url></doc>
