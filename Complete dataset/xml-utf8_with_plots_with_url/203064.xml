<plot>These interstitial shorts follow Fred Armisen (as the eponymous "Fred") as he manages to wriggle his way into various conventions held in swanky NYC hotels in order to ask inane/absurd questions of the keynote speakers, thrusts his microphone into the faces of unsuspecting passersby without saying a word, and essentially has his way with anyone he wants, while allowing us to witness the entire process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203064</url></doc>
