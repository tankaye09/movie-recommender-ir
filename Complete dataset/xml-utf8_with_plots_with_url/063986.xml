<plot>As politicians stand up and promise "change" to the nation, people with a whole lot less power then politicians are out there actually making change. As writer Peter Linebaugh comments in the film you are about to watch, "We can't wait around any longer for the wheel of history to turn - we are the wheel of history." Living together in a converted school bus, a wildly diverse group of artists, filmmakers and musicians set out to fill in our national narrative. They ended up with a road movie like no other, featuring Dead Prez, Oliver Stone, guerrilla poster artist Robbie Conal, and Hurricane Katrina survivors of New Orleans' 9th Ward. Follow the LAFCO (Los Angeles Filmmakers Cooperative) crew as they search for, and find, pockets of change in the most downtrodden parts of America. From Venice Beach to Brooklyn, New York, through the Southwestern desert to the deep south, this is a portrait of the United States seldom seen in the mass media.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063986</url></doc>
