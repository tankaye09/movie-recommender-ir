<plot>Amazonia, 1903. German explorer Theodor Koch-Grünberg travels from Manaus up the Rio Negro, a formidable river and biggest tributary of the Amazon, to its headwaters on the equator. He enters an Indio region as large as Germany, a world of water an forest called Dog's Head. For three years he lives among the natives, seeks out encounters, passionately writes down myths and legends and takes photographs. Ninety years later the same journey. Five Indios return from Manaus to their villages in the immense forest. They travel for four weeks, by ship, motorboat and canoe. Days are spent under the equatorial sun and nights under the Southern Cross. 'Jaguar and Rain' takes a journey into innermost Amazonia, switching from past to present. In the Amazonian cosmos 'the jaguar speaks with the rain'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272728</url></doc>
