<plot>"Here we see the late President of France shooting pheasants which jump from the thickets in every direction, having been scared up by a small army of beaters. As the birds fly up and are killed they are plainly to be seen in the picture. These pictures were taken only a short time before President Faure's death."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442784</url></doc>
