<plot>During the end of World War 2, the soviets dropped an atomic bomb on Berlin. Strengthening the forming iron curtain that soon encompasses the world. Starting small, the Soviets send military advisor's to Europe and many third world nations. Soon invading South America. Throughout the 60 years following the end of the second world war, the soviets grew stronger as the US sat and watched at its allies and neighbors are slowly taken. Next on their agenda, America, home of the brave and free. A place they thought could be taken easy. You are Christoper Stone, an average American that happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Its up to you and your rag tag group of resistance fighters to defend and take back the city of New York. Are you up for the challenge of defending freedom?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203410</url></doc>
