<plot>This is the story of the rivalry between two brothers. H책kan is the successful one, running the family business. Martin is homeless. When their father dies, he divides the company between them. H책kan has always won over Martin in everything, from the marbles they played as children to control of the business. And Martin is fixed on the idea of beating his brother in a game of marbles. If he can just beat him, everything will turn around. He puts all his energy into practicing with his marbles. H책kan wants to buy Martins share of the business. But Martin won't do it unless they play one more game. So they play. And the stakes are Martins shares.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356578</url></doc>
