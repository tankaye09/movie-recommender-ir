<plot>Although scores of people migrate to Bombay, from all over India, most do not even have a roof to live under. Some who are lucky manage to find accommodations but pay very high rents, and others who find accommodations refuse to vacate under any circumstances. Two such tenants are Mrs. Laxmi Abhyankar and her employed daughter, Jaya, who live in a flat in Pali Hill area. They had rented this flat from Lucknow-based Kundanlal Choudhury 15 years ago and have been paying him the same amount of Rs.500/- since then. Kundanlal's son, Anil, comes to Bombay to seek employment, and does get employed. His dad wants him to go and live with the Abhyankars, which he does. He falls in love with Jaya and both plan to get married soon. While in Lucknow, Kundanlal misses his son and re-locates to Bombay, and would like the Abhyankars to vacate the flat. Jaya and Laxmi refuse to vacate, and ask Anil to leave, which he does. Now both Anil and his father reside in a small room, and file a complaint in the local court to arrange to evict the Abhyankars, who have also sworn to fight this matter right to the very end. Watch as lawyers take over their respective lives, get their fees, and get adjournment after adjournment - leaving the Abhyankars and the Choudhurys hanging in suspense as to what is going to happen next.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?293161</url></doc>
