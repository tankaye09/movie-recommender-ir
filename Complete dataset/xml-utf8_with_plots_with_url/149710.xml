<plot>Dealing with the social inequalities present not only at German schools, but at schools everywhere in the (western) world, this story tries to point out how superficial structures and beliefs within one group, primarily youths, can lead to intolerance and harassment towards others, and how certain consequences are unavoidable. People are forced to look for a way out and often find themselves being alone and lost, but here they are encouraged to look for alternative ways in daily relations with others in order to avoid misunderstandings and degrading acts towards human beings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?149710</url></doc>
