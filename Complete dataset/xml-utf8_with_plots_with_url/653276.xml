<plot>Observational glimpse into the under the radar world of boys unfolds over two years through the experiences of Noah and Colin, two friends who attend an elite private boys' school. Documentary follows the boys as they navigate from grade eight to the senior school, playing video games, singing like angels in the choir, and alternately goofing off or napping in class.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653276</url></doc>
