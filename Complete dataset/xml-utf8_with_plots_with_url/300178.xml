<plot>Diya (Aishwarya Rai) travels to Mumbai to help her father's friend (Amitabh Bachchan) run an orphanage. Diya is an intelligent university student who does not agree with arranged marriage. She visits her father's friends house to stay there until she takes her exams. In Mumbai, she meets the wealthy Arjun (Vivek Oberoi), the family friend's son, who has differing views on love. They start spending time with each other and fall in love. Arjun however, is unaware that he is in love, whereas Diya professes her love. Misunderstandings occur until Arjun ventures off to put a smile on her face again after breaking her heart. There, he realizes his true feelings for Diya, who seems to be planning marrying her childhood friend soon. Luckily, this was all just a plan 'Uncle' made to get Arjun to realize his loss.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?300178</url></doc>
