<plot>This show featured video footage from police cars and news helicopters as they followed criminals, drunks, lunatics and anyone else who has watched too many movie chase scenes and thinks they can run away from the police. Most of the time these fugitives ended the chases themselves by driving into trees, guardrails and buildings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661197</url></doc>
