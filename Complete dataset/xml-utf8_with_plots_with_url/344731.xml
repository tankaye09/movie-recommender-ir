<plot>Scott spends too much time having fun and not enough time growing up - too many clubs, drugs and drinking sessions. After having a one night stand with Ally, Scott finds out she is pregnant. Peer pressure and lack of self-confidence leads Scott to suggest an abortion. Pressurised, Ally agrees. Scott cannot face the abortion clinic and leaves Ally to go through the ordeal by herself. But Ally has a change of heart and walks out of the clinic and Scott's life. Scott by chance runs into Ally several years later. Ally has had his son, Daniel, and is doing very well, having worked through a degree at Oxford, whilst being a single parent. She now has a top job in the city. Scott moves to London in a personal quest to earn acknowledgment from his child and respect from Ally. He takes a job at the creche where Daniel is looked after, getting to know him and understand what it's like being a father. His resolve and character are put to the test several times, but has he changed enough for Ally to give him a second chance...?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344731</url></doc>
