<plot>Taken off Larchmont, July 8. Boats are shown one after the other, rounding the south-east stake boat, the Columbia leading. As they approach the Judge's boat the wonderful spread of canvas is shown, three jibs, sheets, topsail and spinnaker set. The Defender's boom dips into the water every now and then, throwing the spray high into the air. Close views of both yachts are also shown, giving details of crews and rigging. The nearby view of the Defender shows her swinging off on another tack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617734</url></doc>
