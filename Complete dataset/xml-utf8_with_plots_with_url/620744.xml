<plot>Tulia, Texas is the site of what's been called one of the worst miscarriages of justice in recent memory. It's where an undercover narcotics officer named Tom Coleman arrested 46 people - nearly all of them black - on charges of being cocaine dealers, sending many of them to prison for a total of 750 years. See the documentary that brought national media attention to the story and led to the exoneration of these wrongfully convicted men and women.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?620744</url></doc>
