<plot>Speedy Ian had been Deep Purple's powerhouse since he joined the band at age 19 in 1968. Armed with a dazzling technique, Paice pushed forward the boundaries of rock drumming. Although influenced by the legendary Buddy Rich, Ian quickly developed his own unique style that lent him drumming spots with Deep Purple, Whitesnake, Gary Moore, and Paul McCartney. This DVD captures the essence of Ian's style with 100 powerful minutes of action complete with interviews, drum clinics and a live studio jam at Abbey Road Studios!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255472</url></doc>
