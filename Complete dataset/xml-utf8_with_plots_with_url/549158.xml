<plot>Meet Jane Ouellette. She's your average everyday mother of two, with a loving husband, a wonderful life... And a brain tumor. Prepare for a journey unlike any other as you travel through the exhilarating highs and the crushing lows of battling brain cancer. Shot by her 26-year-old son, "The Closer She Gets" is an unforgettable portrait of Jane and her family. Using no voice over or interviews, the result is unflinching, thought-provoking, surprisingly funny and relentlessly personal. You, the viewer, are invited to become a member of the Ouellette family as they struggle through this life-altering event - and, like the family, the experience will leave you changed forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549158</url></doc>
