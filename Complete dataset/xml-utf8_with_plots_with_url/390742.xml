<plot>Genuine Pictures of the Ruined City of St. Pierre, Mt. Pelee Smoking, Fort de France and Other Historical Scenes Incidental to the Great Calamity. Our staff photographers returned from Martinique on the steamship "Korona," and brought with them a complete series of typical and genuine Martinique films, which, when exhibited in connection with our Mt. Pelee films, makes a complete entertainment in themselves. Our photographers were dispatched to the scene of the disaster immediately after the news reached this country, and during the following two months succeeded in procuring a set of motion picture negatives that are of extraordinary interest and rare photographic excellence. The films showing native women give a clear idea of the manual labor performed by the sex and other native customs. A splendid picture showing how the native women are compelled to toil for a living.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390742</url></doc>
