<plot>He epitomized elegance and sophistication seamlessly interwoven with jazz and blues. Relive the most-memorable melodies of composer, pianist, and bandleader Edward Kennedy Ellington - known for all time as "Duke" - in rare vintage performances that allow you to hear and see the Duke at the top of his form. Songs include such Ellington favorites as Sophisticated Lady, Cottontail, and Mood Indigo, as well as immortal standards such as Caravan and Stormy Weather, just to name a few. No jazz fan should be without DUKE ELLINGTON SWINGING AT HIS BEST.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161804</url></doc>
