<plot>In this picture we bring into view the famous Third Trinity of Cambridge winning the Grand Challenge Cup by a scant half boat length, in a most exciting finish with the Leander crew. The crews pass close to our camera, and the audience can scarcely make out who is the winner, so close is the finish. A very fine film in every respect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604416</url></doc>
