<plot>The Sopranist is a film concerning Faith &amp; Opera. This film deals with a man, having an indefinable and divine voice. The Sopranist is set in Italy, in the present days. It's a completely Italian film and it shows a culture that is slowly vanishing.In THE SOPRANIST I described a society, the Italian one, that destroys art &amp; artists. In the 17th century the sopranists were sacred while nowadays they are humiliated and considered freaks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?259456</url></doc>
