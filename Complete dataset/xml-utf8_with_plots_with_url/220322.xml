<plot>On his way to the glee club, Goofy Goat encounters a road hog - a pompous society pig being chauffeured in a car large enough to accommodate her enormous behind. A traffic cop stops them at an intersection, which gives Goofy the chance to lift his car up like a skirt and dance in front of her. When the cop lets them proceed, Goofy lifts up one of the back wheels and shoots exhaust fumes at her as a gesture of contempt. She utters "Damn" under her breath. Finally, Goofy makes it to the glee club in time for the amateur talent show. First, three kittens sing about losing their mittens. Next, Goofy's girlfriend plays the piano so vigorously that it breaks apart. Goofy, who happened to be inside the piano, extricates a harp from the wreckage, and she plays that instead. Next, a couple of bagpipers are momentarily thwarted when Goofy punctures their bags with an umbrella. Undeterred, they pick up a couple of pigs and play them instead. Finally, Goofy plays his own music with a makeshift accordion, but ends up in an epic battle with the anthropomorphic instrument.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220322</url></doc>
