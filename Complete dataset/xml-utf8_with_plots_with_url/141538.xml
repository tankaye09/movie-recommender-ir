<plot>After a warp drive malfunction, the Material Defender finds himself barely alive, and falling into a sun. Saved from death by some locals, you discover that Dravis, head of the Post Terran Mining Corporation, deliberately had you killed. Having experimented with the virus that turns robots into killers, you were a liability. With a new GL-class Pyro, you plan on getting paid, and then killing Dravis. In that order.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?141538</url></doc>
