<plot>Africa - one of the largest and most populated continents on Earth, and one of the most diverse. There is great beauty to be found here but also unimaginable despair. It is a land full of history and rich culture but also of poverty and disease. We will follow popular celebrities into the heart of Kenya for an up-close and personal look at an enigmatic country and its wonderful people. This will be a unique and affecting journey for each famous personality as they investigate the triumphs and tragedies of Kenya from a personal viewpoint. Carrying their own camera and shooting their own footage of whatever they want, we will get a first person perspective of what they find important, beautiful, tragic or interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186681</url></doc>
