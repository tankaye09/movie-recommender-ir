<plot>Diary of a housewife, going mad. Armelle is nearly 30, with a husband and two sons. It's the early 80s in France, unemployment is high, and she's not worked (outside the home) since she was a dancer at age 20. She cooks, cleans, shops, takes her boys to school, and her guilty pleasure is to have her hair shampooed, an addiction she tries to hide from her husband. An architect in her building leers at her. She becomes depressed and tries to find a job. When the brakes on the family car go out as she's taking it to a garage and she narrowly misses several pedestrians, she snaps. The architect assaults her, and desperation sets in. Has she any options or any hope?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?310643</url></doc>
