<plot>Henry Pluzman, a struggling writer desperate to unlock his mind's creative powers, pays his Therapist to hypnotize him, and make his subconscious mind do the writing for him. Following the hypnotic session, Pluzman's therapist informs him that from now on, whenever he is blocked, all he needs to do is snap his fingers twice in his ears, and he'll enter into a trance during which his subconscious will take over and write for him. When his subconscious is finished writing, Henry will wake up. Success comes rapidly to Henry now. Henry becomes increasingly paranoid and unhappy. The film only turns for the worse as his mind takes over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436433</url></doc>
