<plot>Kevin's Friend follows the story of Kevin, a quiet seven-year-old boy. Every day he walks home from school by cutting through the park. One afternoon he meets a girl at his favorite spot beside a pond. She is a little older than he, and much more outgoing. Over the next few days, they meet at the same time and same place. But despite the fact that she seems to be a rather confident girl, radiant and full of energy, there is something altogether different about her. Then a question is asked.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290056</url></doc>
