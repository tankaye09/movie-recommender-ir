<plot>Part comeback, part retrospective, "Family for Life" is the documentary feature created as a companion for the CD of the same name and released as a CD/DVD Combo on November 20th, 2007. Featuring rare tour footage, 3 live concerts, as well as performances from Ozzfest, interviews, and backstage shenanigans, the film gives a look at a band on the verge of their popularity in the late 90's/early 00's ending just before their breakup in 2003 and return in 2007.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?443676</url></doc>
