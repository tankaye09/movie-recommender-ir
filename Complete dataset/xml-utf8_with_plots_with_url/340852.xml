<plot>When Carol's super-hip company throws it's trademark "Dead Celebrity" Halloween party, she knows she can't be a no-show like last year. And, her "Pat Nixon" costume only mocks her usual dowdy look. So, throwing caution to the wind (for the first time in her life), she shows up dressed as Marilyn Monroe. So here she is in celebrity heaven (or is it hell), and they are all there: James Dean, Jimmy Hendrix, Tupak, Joan Crawford, JFK, RFK, MLK And it's Charles as Elvis. - The 1956 version, (the one that kick-started sexual rock-n-roll revolution) that can't seem to get enough of her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340852</url></doc>
