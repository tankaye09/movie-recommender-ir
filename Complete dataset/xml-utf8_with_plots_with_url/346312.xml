<plot>Lucas is a young ear of corn who lives on a stalk with his mother. He is an inquisitive young cob, always pestering his mother with questions about their future together. Lucas's questions are soon answered when an unseen farmer reaps him away from his mother and ships him off to the big city to be sold in a fruit market. The little ear is purchased almost immediately, but poor Lucas has no idea what cruel fate is in store for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346312</url></doc>
