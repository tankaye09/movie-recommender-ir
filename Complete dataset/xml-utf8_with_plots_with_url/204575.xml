<plot>Frightland revolves around a pair of college students that travel to a small town in Delaware to complete their film school video thesis about a deceased child killing devil worshiper named Angus Greene. Murdered some 35 years ago, Greene's path of rage has lingered in this small town all the way up to present day, where now a very popular Halloween haunted hayride amusement attraction resides on the very ground he once owned. Mysterious accidental deaths piled up on the land now called FRIGHTLAND, only adding to local suspicion about this area being cursed by the evil that Greene represented. On this one very dark night, these filmmakers on a mission to capture answers, will find out if these myths really are real!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204575</url></doc>
