<plot>"Head Coach" reveals a different side of nationally recognized, NCAA Division 1 football and basketball coaches. Episodes feature interviews with the coach as he shares his story, original practice footage, and input from staff, friends and family members. This show is not as much about X's and O's, but about the man behind the persona and the program he has built. It combines themes of character and leadership with the grit of the sport.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232770</url></doc>
