<plot>Jack recently learned that his younger sister Jordan was raped, a secret she has kept hidden from Jack for over three years. Jack wants to know who did it. But Jordan won't tell him. She's too afraid of what Jack might do. But Jack has other ways of getting answers and soon learns the identity of his sister's rapist. While Jack secretly plots to punish the rapist, Jordan seeks comfort from her best friend Brooke, a hard-core goth girl who's been hiding a few secrets of her own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578294</url></doc>
