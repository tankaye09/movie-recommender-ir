<plot>In 1881 David Whitmer seeks the signature of Gen. Alexander W. Doniphan on an affidavit attesting to his honesty and integrity, with plans to have it published in the local paper (Richmond, Missouri) with a statement refuting that he had denied his witness that an angel had shown him the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Whitmer recalls the translation of the book in 1829 while Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery stayed at the Whitmer family home in Fayette, New York (Joseph translating and Oliver acting as scribe). After praying together, an angel shows the plates and says that the translation is correct. All three are later excommunicated from the church led by Smith, but as Whitmer relates, Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris testified to the end of their lives to the truthfulness of what they witnessed (dying in 1850 and 1875 respectively and after re-joining the church). Doniphan, a lawyer, signs the document and says that he would hate to argue in court against such strong evidence. Despite never returning to the Mormon Church, Whitmer holds fast to his testimony regarding The Book of Mormon until his death in 1888.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?595914</url></doc>
