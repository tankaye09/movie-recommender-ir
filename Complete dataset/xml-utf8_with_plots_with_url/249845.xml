<plot>Surendra Nath and Satyendra Nath are two brothers who live in an old palatial home with their dad, mom, and sister. The Nath family is undergoing hard times as their property is under dispute, and a unfavorable decision by the courts, causes the family to lose face in the community. To make matters worse, Satyendra is arrested by the police for theft of Rs.10,000/- from his workplace. Satyendra thinks his brother stole the money, and is covering up for him, while the rest of the family is shocked and dismayed at this turn of events. All eyes and ears are now on the decision of the Court, which will decide who is guilty in the eyes of the law.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249845</url></doc>
