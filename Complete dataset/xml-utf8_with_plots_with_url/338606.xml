<plot>"The cook in the kitchen leaves a pan of potatoes while she answers the door bell. Willie takes advantage of her absence to put the potatoes in the refrigerator and fill the pan with water, putting it up on the cupboard. Bridget returns and tries to get the pan down with an umbrella, and succeeds in giving herself a ducking, much to Willie's delight."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338606</url></doc>
