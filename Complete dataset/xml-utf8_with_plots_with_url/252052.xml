<plot>I Am... is a kinetic, first person journey through the jagged magnifying glass of the modern high-school experience. Alan So's directorial debut observes the cold, locker-filled hallways through the eyes of Erin, a popular student who is quick to dismiss the new kid, Weezy, as a menace due to his "gangsta" like appearance. After unwittingly spying upon what he believes to be Weezy's involvement in a series of seemingly shady incidents, Erin can't help but feel that Weezy is beginning to live up to his dangerous "gangsta" persona. From stolen library CD's to secret deals in dark corners, Weezy certainly isn't making a reputable name for himself against the intense scrutiny of his peers. Shot in true High-Definition and set to a shattering Hip-Hop score by Stephen "King Luck" Williams, I Am... holds up a raw, uncompromising mirror for today's youth to examine their own socially constructed identities and fears. Do we ever actually see what our prejudices tell us we see? And are we really that far-removed from the things we fear, or even hate?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252052</url></doc>
