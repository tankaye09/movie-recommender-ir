<plot>When Timawa meets Delgado "When Timawa meets Delgado" is an unusual story that revolves around the equally-unconventional lives Jun Delgado and Ruben Timawa, and their only way to reach their American dreams: to be nurses. A self-proclaimed filmmaker whose parents and siblings are already in America , Delgado decides to enroll in Nursing after breaking up with his nagging girlfriend. Timawa, on the other hand, is a gay literature teacher and a Palanca award-winning writer who also decides to enroll in nursing when the object of his desire went to America . When they meet at the College of Nursing dean's office, worlds of possibilities open.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653233</url></doc>
