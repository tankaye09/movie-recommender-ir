<plot>Manual follows Sean and Samantha, a brother and sister who came from a family of gifted hockey players. Both were talented players as well, however once they began playing for serious high school programs they grew tired and quit. Was it the sport that lost its innocence or was it them? After quitting things change for Sean and Sam. They began to feel like failures, thinking they disappointed their parents. And despite their attempts to remain strong and independent after breaking the family tradition, they both wind up spinning out of control in vicious cycles of rebellion and self-destruction. Sean turns to the drink and disastrous one-night stands, Sam an unrealistic relationship that leaves her a pregnant single mother. Manual is intimate film about people striving for comfort and identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356917</url></doc>
