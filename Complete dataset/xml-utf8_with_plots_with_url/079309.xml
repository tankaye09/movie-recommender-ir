<plot>The Thomsons - parents Thomas and Francie, and children Willa, Arthur, Beatrice (nicknamed Booky) and Jakey - are a loving working class family living in the Depression era in Toronto. It's September and the new school year has just started. Willa has thoughts of attending medical school after she graduates, despite the family not having the money to send her. Arthur is showing aptitude in drawing, and although his parents want to support his skill, Thomas in particular wants him to take up a vocation that is a little more stable. This difference places a strain between father and son. And Booky is reveling in her skills in spelling class. Although it's fall, spring fever has hit the Thomson women. Francie has run into an old high school beau, reminiscing on times with him making her think that she has been neglecting the romantic side of her marriage. Willa, the part time librarian, is attracted to Russell, the medical student she meets at the library. And 11-year old Booky is happy that she has been asked to tutor the new older sixth grade student, Georgie Dunlop, in spelling, since she has a crush on him, her first ever. She just can't wait for him to ask her to the school dance. But she begins to have mixed feelings about Georgie based on a gift he gives to her. Digging a little deeper, Booky begins to understand both the good and bad of Georgie.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079309</url></doc>
