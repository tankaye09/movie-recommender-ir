<plot>Nominated by friends and relatives who accompany them on their journey, eight Canadians are chosen each season of the series potentially to be named Canada's Worst Driver. The eight are sent to the Driver's Rehabilitation Centre where symbolically they are stripped of their car keys and/or driver's license. They are then subjected to a two-week session of driving challenges to test their driving skill and knowledge, each challenge first performed by the host, a self-professed average driver, to demonstrate that the challenge can be completed successfully. They are also provided assistance in improving their driving by a panel of experts. Each episode presents three challenges. Starting at the end of the season's second episode, the experts evaluate how each has done, and "graduates" one person per episode, the graduate getting back his/her keys/driver's license and allowed to drive away from the Centre. At the end of the two weeks on the season's finale where three driver's remain, each is subjected to an on-road test through a busy downtown city situation. After that, one of the remaining three will be named Canada's Worst Driver.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092443</url></doc>
