<plot>11:11 is designed to play backwards, literally. By filming in reverse, 11:11 flips the script on Anna and Otto's Hollywood tale of narcissistic lust. Anna and Otto, the lovers in 11:11, glide around a gravity free universe erasing their collective past with every step they take. Anna's pregnancy is a turning point in their relationship. When Otto turns Anna's experience into parody, Anna takes her revenge. 11:11 makes backward English sound like a real language. 11:11 is a hip comedy in reverse that plays like a sexy foreign film. Sit back, relax and let your right brain enjoy the ride.</plot><plot>11:11 is designed to play backwards, literally.
