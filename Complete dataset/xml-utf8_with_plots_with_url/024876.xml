<plot>"African Soul, American Heart" is a dream in the heart of Joseph Akol Makeer, one of nearly 4000 Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan resettled in America. Now a college graduate, author of the memoir "From Africa to America: The Journey of a Lost Boy of Sudan," and father to three children born in the United States, Joseph is troubled by memories of the orphans he left behind. After years of war, returning refugees are finding their villages burned, the water contaminated, the cattle gone, and their way of life destroyed. "African Soul, American Heart" retraces the journey of the Lost Boys from Sudan to Ethiopia to Kenya and follows Joseph back to the Kenyan refugee camp and the Sudanese village where he was born. Focusing on the orphans, Joseph interviews officials, clergy, and the children themselves, learning there are more than 2100 orphans in this village of 19,000. They need food, shelter, clothing, and medical care, and they dream of going to school. Back in America, he shares his plan to build a boarding facility to nurture these orphans and retain their ties to village life. Joseph knows in his soul that if these children are helped, "they will be good leaders in our nation and in our world."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024876</url></doc>
