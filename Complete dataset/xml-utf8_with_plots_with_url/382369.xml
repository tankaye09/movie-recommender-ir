<plot>Oscar-winning composer Gabriel Yared has written the score for films such as 'The English Patient', 'Betty Blue', 'The Talented Mr Ripley', 'Sylvia', 'Autumn in New York' and 'Cold Mountain'. This intimate film explores the tireless composer's inspirations and his quest to learn more about his art. The director had exclusive access to the delicate collaborative relationship between Yared and Anthony Minghella while they worked on the score for 'Cold Mountain' - a score that went on to be nominated for an Oscar. Extracts from Yared and Minghella's collaborations are included and we also see Yared conducting a number of his works.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382369</url></doc>
