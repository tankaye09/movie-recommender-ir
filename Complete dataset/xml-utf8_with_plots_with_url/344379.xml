<plot>Four friends play an evening game of dominoes, drink, and talk about women. As Glenn asks, who would know that such a good time would turn into this? Each one is going through or has recently experienced a painful breakup. Wesley seems to have worked through his, even though it took him close to suicide. Glenn turns inward; he's depressed and sometimes weepy. Chris seems mad at the world. Sammy looks low-key and self-contained. They know too much about each other, so as the dominoes clack and the liquor flows, the hostility they've been expressing about women gets turned toward each other. Emotions and beliefs about manhood churn. How will the evening end?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344379</url></doc>
