<plot>Examines the social, economic, and personal barriers two ex-offenders face as they try to reintegrate into their communities and families. In and out of prison for more than 30 years, Omar and Pete are determined to change their lives. Upon release, both participate in the Maryland Reentry Program, which is designed to help long-term repeat offenders stay out of prison by offering transitional housing, health care, employment assistance, and educational opportunities. The film follows the two long-time friends for several years after what they hope will be their final prison release. In that time, their lives take divergent paths as one wrestles with addiction and fear while the other finds success and freedom through helping others. Their story boldly exposes the critical issues concerning reintegration and the complex, often frustrating challenges that men who were formerly incarcerated face when reentering society. Unnflinching portrait of how challenging life on the outside can be for men who have lived much of their lives behind bars.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410223</url></doc>
