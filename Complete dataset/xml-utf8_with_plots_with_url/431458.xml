<plot>This is one of the funniest films we have ever seen. An amateur photographer attempts to take a picture of an express train coming toward him. He sets his camera up inside the track directly in the path of the huge locomotive coming at the rate of 50 miles an hour. Failing to get out of the way in time, the train strikes him and he is flung far out in the road with his camera, which is demolished. It is impossible to kill the fiend photographer. After the train passes he arises and grasping the remains of his precious camera he rushes across the tracks, but stops again to view the landscape. A track walker saves him from another train coming in an opposite direction by throwing him bodily in a ditch. This film is a beauty from beginning to end and anyone not amused by it is void of all humor. Book it if you want a star picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431458</url></doc>
