<plot>This short is the 12th in the "This Is America" series from RKO, created primarily to offset the loss of their long-running "March of Time" series to 20th Century-Fox. This one examines post-war Los Angeles (and Hollywood) with details of the city's history and development. Like other war-boom cities, L.A. was pre-occupied with the loss-of-jobs by its large number of war workers, and tells what civic organizations were doing to overcome the situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090787</url></doc>
