<plot>Goofy shows us how to swim, first using a piano stool to demonstrate the strokes, right into the middle of traffic and back again. Next, Goofy tries to change in a tiny beachhouse and ends up underwater without realizing it. He eats his picnic lunch and finds himself literally tied into knots with cramps. Next, Goofy takes on diving, as first demonstrated by an outline model; of course, for him, it doesn't go nearly as well. Finally, Goofy tries riding the surf in an inner tube, but first it's punctured by an ill-placed anchor, then it turns into a slingshot thanks to a couple of cleverly placed posts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248767</url></doc>
