<plot>"Number Please," a Goodson-Todman Production, was a Hangman-type game that was an early predecessor-of-sorts to the far-more successful "Wheel of Fortune." Two contestants, one a champion, competed in this game. Host Collyer showed the players a mystery word puzzle, which was always led to the identity of a prize. Contestants, one at a time, called out a number they believed would help them solve the puzzle. The first player to correctly solve the puzzle (e.g., ELECTRIC SHAVER; BACKYARD BARBECUE FOR FIFTY FRIENDS; CHEVROLET IMPALA SEDAN) won the prize named. The highest-scoring contestant of the day was champion; he/she competed until defeated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402809</url></doc>
