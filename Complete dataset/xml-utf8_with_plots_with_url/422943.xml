<plot>"During the summer months the famous order of Elks held a convention at Atlantic City, N.J., the popular seaside resort. One of their features was a grand street parade in which thousands participated. This without exception is one of the best parade films ever made, not alone for photographic worth, but because many of the participants can be easily recognized and many of the contingents will amuse you with their antics. The boys from Hartford all travel in go-carts."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422943</url></doc>
