<plot>Deep in the mountains of North Carolina, behind all the flashing lights and twirling rides, Billy and Sue Clark's Family Carnival is in turmoil. They need a good summer. They're deep in debt, and hoping for fair weather and good crowds to bail them out. With only hours left before opening day in a new town, hot-headed Billy unleashes his pent-up anger when his crew falls behind schedule, and he berates his 20 year-old granddaughter, Gabby, for her lazy attitude. Moving on to another town, the Clark family's worst nightmare becomes a soggy, somber reality when constant rain drives the paying customers away. "Ay yi yi," says Billy, "There's no business like it."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188744</url></doc>
