<plot>You have no doubt heard of Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, the largest park in the world. For scenery, both natural and artificial, this famous garden spot surpasses anything of its kind. Within the past few years a trolley has been circling the prettiest part of the park and this picture was taken while the car was going at a rapid rate, dashing through glends, uphill and downdale, passing small stations on the route, stopping to take on and discharge passengers, and finally arriving at its destination at the entrance to the great park. Beautiful natural scenery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187815</url></doc>
