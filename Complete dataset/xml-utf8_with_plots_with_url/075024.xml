<plot>An updated version of the popular early-80's game show of the same name. While the original used pairs of family members as contestants, this version used a simpler, one- on-one format. Presented with a grid of hexagons, each with a letter printed on it, one contestant had to make a horizontal line of five hexes, while his opponent tried to make a vertical line of four. For each chosen hex, a general knowledge question was asked, the answer to which began with the letter printed on the hex. Whoever gave the correct answer to the question got control of the hex and could choose the next hex to be used.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075024</url></doc>
