<plot>Explores the lives of eight Sudanese refugees. Displaced from their homes in the late 1980's due to a brutal civil war, the youngest boys were forced to flee alone. Pitted against an Arab Militia, wild animals, starvation, and thirst the boys survived a trek of 1,000 miles and twelve years in refugee camps before coming to the United States. Enduring such unimaginable hardships left them with many stories to tell. In their own voices, these are their stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336062</url></doc>
