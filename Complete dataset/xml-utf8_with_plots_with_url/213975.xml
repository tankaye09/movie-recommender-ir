<plot>Dhanraj (Kader Khan) is a mild-mannered man who is married to a wealthy, petty-minded, and controlling wife (Shashikala). Dhanraj has two sons and a daughter. The elder son Ram (Rishi Kapoor) is married to Seeta (Jaya Pradha); the younger son, Amar (Govinda) is in love with Asha (Farha); and the daughter Uma (Aruna Irani) is married to Lallu Ram (Ashok Saraf). Uma prefers to live with her mother instead of her husband's residence. Mrs. Dhanraj wants Amar to marry a very rich girl so that she can accumulate more wealth through a large dowry. Ram finds that his brother Amar and his wife Seeta are very close, and starts suspecting them of having an affair with each other, he makes observations but is not ready to confront anyone. Ram's suspicions are still not laid to rest even when Amar marries Asha. Ram starts to drink and ends up getting friendly with a childhood friend, Deepa (Anita Raaj).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213975</url></doc>
