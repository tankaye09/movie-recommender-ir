<plot>Mr. Bradley has been getting increasingly irritable, and today he is annoyed by everything, constantly snapping at the servants and at his wife. Then, as he is being driven by his chauffeur, the car stalls. Mr. Bradley becomes impatient with the chauffeur's repair work, and wanders off into a nearby woods. When he sees a boy fishing in a stream, he strikes up a conversation with him. Soon Mr. Bradley starts to think that a little time spent outdoors might be just what he needs to calm his nerves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412724</url></doc>
