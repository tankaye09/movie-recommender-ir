<plot>Get Happy is a coming of age musical extravaganza about a child raised by his mother and grandmother who allowed him to express himself in a most unconventional way. This documentary includes actual footage of Mark Payne as a childhood performer. By age 13 Mark was working with many luminaries including Bob Hope and Milton Berle! Early in his life, Mark designed clothes worn by Madonna and Cher as well as establishing a successful singing career. He has evolved into one of the most sought after makeup artists in Hollywood.  More than just a documentary about someone's life this short film is an inspiration to all who have dreams and ambitions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213267</url></doc>
