<plot>A psychological thriller, INTO THE GARDEN is set in the lush Northwest Rainforest. RUTH HARPER is a lonely botanist in her forties with murderous secrets and a closer relationship to her plants than to people. After a chance encounter with a young visiting professor, SCOTT BROWN, she becomes obsessed with him and subtly lures him to become a tenant in her long-abandoned guest house. During a brief affair, overwhelmed with steamy, treacherous lust, Scott realizes that Ruth is mentally fragile and potentially dangerous. When he reminds her that he has a girlfriend back East and tries to end the affair, she first uses sex as a weapon then violently overpowers him by employing deadly "medicinal" plants. Ruth imprisons Scott in her "garden" and his life hangs by a tendril.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267531</url></doc>
