<plot>Leslie Andrews is obsessed with death. Specifically, her own death. Inspired by the crime scene photos her dad showed her as a child, she started taking photographs of herself dead in various fascinating, morbid, and often beautiful ways. From Death By Garden Hose to Death By Dumpster, she plays out her own demise in the 10 seconds before the self-timer on her camera goes off. This short documentary follows Leslie through several of her photographic scenarios, and explores the dark thoughts of this seemingly cheerful actress struggling to succeed in Hollywood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134059</url></doc>
