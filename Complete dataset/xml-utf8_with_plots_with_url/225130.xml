<plot>A more traditional, though complicated version of the original plot in Gunsundari (1927). A joint family headed by Seth Shyamaldas (Bawa) includes two sons Chandrakant (Bilimoria) and Vinu (Apte) and daughter Kusum (Shanta). The stories of the father and each of the three children unfold and in each Gunsundari (Gohar), Chandrakant's dutiful wife, appears as the saviour. Shyamaldas is a drunkard, accused of fathering an illegitimate child. Chandrakant becomes a drunk falling into the clutches of both the villain Madanrai (Gangaprasad) and the prostitute Bansari (Rampiary) who try to steal his property. Sister-in-law Sushila (Kamala) is unhappily married to Vasantrai (Ghory) who pawns her necklace. Gunsundari gives her some money and later gets into trouble because she is sworn to secrecy and cannot account for the money. Gunsundari tries to entice her husband back from Bansari, but eventually finds herself on the streets, destitute. She finally meets Chandrakant, who is also on the streets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225130</url></doc>
