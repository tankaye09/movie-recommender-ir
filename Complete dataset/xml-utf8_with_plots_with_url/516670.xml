<plot>Summer vacation was always a blast when Sissy spent time at her Aunt and Uncle's house. The cousins always had a great time. Sissy gets a surprise when her Mom and Dad tell her that the normal daily outing will be extended for an entire week! The beginning of the week was wonderful, but by mid-week, Sissy was getting bored and wanted to go home. Her parents told her to make something up, if she wasn't having fun. That's just what they did! Gathering the neighborhood kids, they sold tickets and popcorn and put on a most imaginative circus. They had such a great time, they vowed to do it every summer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516670</url></doc>
