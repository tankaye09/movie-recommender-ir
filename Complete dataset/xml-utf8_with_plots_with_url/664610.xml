<plot>After the death of his dad, Dayashankar Pandey (Sunil Shetty) arranges the marriage of his two sisters. In debt, he goes to the city to ask the tenants to leave his house, as he intends to sell it and repay his debts. A woman (Suhasini Mulay), her two daughters, Jyoti, Saraswati (Mahima Chaudhry), and one son, Chotu (Master Aditi) are living there. When Dayashankar asks them to vacate, they refuse. What results is Dayashankar's hilarious attempts to force them to vacate - from seeking legal advice; filing police reports; asking goons to remove them - moving in himself. Will Dayashankar succeed in his attempts to evict his tenants?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664610</url></doc>
