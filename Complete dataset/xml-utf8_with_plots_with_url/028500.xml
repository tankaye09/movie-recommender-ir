<plot>Widowed Advocate Triloki Prasad lives a wealthy lifestyle in a small town in India with two sons, Advocate Ashok - who is married to Geeta, and Alok - who has yet to settle down in their law firm. Alok is fond of music and does enroll in classes run by Pandit Jamuna Prasad. On his return, his father asks him to accompany Ashok to their law firm and start learning to practice, which he agrees to do. Then one day Triloki finds out that Alok has not been at the firm but is instead spending time in the local slums with a former courtesan named Sarju Bai Banaraswali. He cautions Alok about this, but Alok continues to visit Sarju Bai. When Mr. Gupta approaches Triloki about taking possession &amp; demolishing the slum area, Triloki readily agrees and with his expertise manages to sway the Court's decision in Gupta's favor. As a result, Sarju Bai and others are rendered homeless. With the fee he receives from Gupta, he asks Alok to purchase a used car for himself. But Alok purchases a horse-carriage and decides to drive it himself to make a living. His enraged father asks him to leave the house. When Triloki finds out that Alok is doing well in his work, he decides to hire motor coaches to transport people at a much cheaper price, thus cutting off Alok's earnings and perhaps forcing him to reconsider his decision, apologize, and return home to his father. The question remains, will these actions force Alok to return home, or will the misunderstandings between father and son continue indefinitely</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?028500</url></doc>
