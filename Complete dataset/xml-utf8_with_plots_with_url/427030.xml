<plot>Howard and Betty have been married for 40 very long years. Howard has always had a bit of a temper, but now that he is retired and spending so much time at home, he is finding it even harder to contain his irritation with his doting wife. Nearing the end of his rope, Howard makes one last effort to maintain peace with Betty - he promises to control his temper for an entire day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427030</url></doc>
