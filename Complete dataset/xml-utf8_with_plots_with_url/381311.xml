<plot>Multiple Personality is about the human mind and its dominant personality. The story is told through a lonely hermit crab who embodies the dominant personality. He longs for a friend. The human mind often during long isolation or loneliness creates another personality. Then one day to the lonely hermit's amazement another hermit appears. The two seem to become friends but after a while they begin to clash because there can only be one dominant personality in the human mind. The lonely hermit starts to fight with the other and in his frustration, more hermits begin to pop out. The more angry the hermit gets, the more hermits pop out. Eventually the hermit blacks out and awakens to find that he has become what he has come to hate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381311</url></doc>
