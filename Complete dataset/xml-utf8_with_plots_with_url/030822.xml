<plot>Tawdry remake of the 1979 Chuck Barris cult classic game show, "Three's a Crowd." Three sets of three contestants competed, each having a central contestant and two companions (e.g., a current boy/girlfriend and an ex-boy/girlfriend). With the companions off-stage, host Thicke posed a (usually embarrassing) question to the central contestant. Points were scored depending on whether one or both of the contestant's companions matched answers. After a series of questions came the end game, where Thicke posed multiple-choice personality trait-type questions to one team at a time; separately, each companion selected one of three possible answers. A match earned points. The leading companion at the end of the round won a $1,000 bonus (and usually eternal embarrassment).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030822</url></doc>
