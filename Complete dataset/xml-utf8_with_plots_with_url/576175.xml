<plot>The Justice system has gone mad, perpetrators have more rights than victims, and repeat offenders continually slip between the cracks. It's wrong, and it needs to change. One man sacrificed himself to transform society, he forced us to become a community, he compelled us to stand up and protect one another from violent crime. How did he do it? He killed people, lots of people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576175</url></doc>
