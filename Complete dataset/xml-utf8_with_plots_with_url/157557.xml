<plot>Kyla, a 26 year old African American woman remains undisturbed in within the comfort zone of her supportive family, her loyal sweet heart and close knit friends. An admitted late bloomer, Kyla returns for her eighth year as a part time student at the local university. An unforeseen, yet heart awakening physical attraction and emotional bond form between Kyla and another female classmate. An uncertain and fearful Kyla must decide whether to continue the now lopsided relationship with her trusting boyfriend of four years, or submit to the unfamiliar passions felt towards another woman. Brace yourself for this intense journey as Kyla searches for an answer to the common question, "Who am I?" You'll relate to the comical conversations Kyla shares with her friends, connect with her thoughts as she silently questions life's everyday activities, and empathize with her as she struggles with the unknown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?157557</url></doc>
