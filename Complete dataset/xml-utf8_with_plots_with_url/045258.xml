<plot>Dr Abbas Imad completes his residency and joins a hectic group practice. He dreams of paying off his debts and making his live-in grandmother comfortable. His well planned future starts to shatter after his lover moves in and they have to deal with Grandma Ariana's difficult behavior. Hoping this will pass Abbas throws himself into his work believing things will work them-selves out. Ultimately, Ariana's dementia proves to be the real issue at hand, and Karl ends up in the role of care-giver. Abbas has to come to terms with his denial, a stressful practice, his relationship, which is about to end, and the harsh reality that the loving woman who raised him no longer exists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045258</url></doc>
