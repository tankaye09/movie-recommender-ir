<plot>After a tragic robbery and the loss of his wife, Riley wakes up in a hospital to hear that he had been paralyzed from the waist down. After missing his wife's funeral, Riley loses the will to live until he hears that the man that put him in the wheelchair has yet to be caught. After the robber shows up at his house to see Riley sitting helplessly in a wheelchair, Riley must now learn to walk again, not only to revenge his wife's murder, but also to protect his son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118956</url></doc>
