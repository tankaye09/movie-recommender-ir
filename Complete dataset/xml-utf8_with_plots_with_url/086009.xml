<plot>In Building Faythe co-directors Matt Tucker and Bill Tucker follow the often obscure activities of an aspiring Newfoundland-artist as he struggles to complete an ambitious and potentially dangerous public-art project. Exactly how he will accomplish his goals and the exact nature of the project are not reveled until the climax of the film. Troubled relationships with family and friends and a need to prove himself drive him forward; while the law, the weather and his own personality threaten to hold him back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086009</url></doc>
