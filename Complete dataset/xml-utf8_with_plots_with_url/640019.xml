<plot>Only few people know that Hungary is a "superpower" in terms of its otter populations. Here thrives the strongest population of these cute looking professional predators - thanks to the hard work of a deeply devoted man and also to the less-known precious wetlands of Hungary. The film revolves around am orphaned but rescued otter pup. Through her story we learn about the life of otters and the work that is going on in the background to save them and their biotope, the Hungarian wetlands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640019</url></doc>
