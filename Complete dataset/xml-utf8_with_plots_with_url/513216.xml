<plot>In response to the crisis in Darfur, mtvU sent three college students, one producer and two body guards to refugee camps in Chad to hear the victims' stories. For the students, this experience attached faces to the 180,000 deaths and the 2 million displaces persons. For the refugees, the team offered an outlet through which they could speak to the world. Mothers told of their dying sons and children drew pictures of the Janjaweed militias; both facets of the atrocities that statistics and news clips cannot convey appropriately.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513216</url></doc>
