<plot>Scope, a series of five experimental music videos, starts from the end of a story and moves its way back, explaining the plot from minimal and maximal vantage points. Because of this, the storyline seems unexplainable until the final three minutes in "Tiddler". Combining these contrasting points of view to create a sense of confusion, Scope incorporates music to add to the bipolarity of these shots, like going from calm, soothing mathematically precisioned timed music box chimes to raw, random mechanically produced noises. Scope's goal is to show another way that a story can be told. In the end, Scope is definitely not for everyone. However, those who are patient will certainly appreciate its beauty and theory of repititon and synthesizing. A plot summary of this film will never be available, as the point of the film is to tell you a simple story through alternative means. A sysnopsis would defeat that purpose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481570</url></doc>
