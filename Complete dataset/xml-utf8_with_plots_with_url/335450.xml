<plot>Some people deal with death by crying, or getting angry, or drinking themselves into a coma. Eli does none of these. In fact, Eli does nothing. At all. But his indifference towards the loss of a loved one leads to the sudden loss of his own life. And Rachel, his wife, can't have that. She's been there for him at all other points in his life. Now she must be there for him after her own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335450</url></doc>
