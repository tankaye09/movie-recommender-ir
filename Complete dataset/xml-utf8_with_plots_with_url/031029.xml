<plot>Dennis gets a job at Clifford Electronics, a local store run by the eccentric, sports metaphor-prone Joseph Clifford. After the first day on the job, Dennis realizes that both his boss and his ragtag crew of co-workers have little, if any, interest in selling electronics; instead, they'd rather meet every night after work to solve low-level crimes and eat low-quality pie. Dennis' life soon becomes a hectic whirl of finding lost keys, thwarting would-be robbers, and occasionally selling a VCR. After his co-workers destroy his girlfriend's art opening, Dennis decides to leave the Clifford's Electronics team and return to hanging out with his slothful roommate Roger. But hell hath no fury like a crime-solving-club scorned, and Dennis soon discovers that, while it's easy to take the team out of Dennis, his co-workers refuse to take Dennis out of the team.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031029</url></doc>
