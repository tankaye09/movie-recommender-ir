<plot>In this pilot which was never aired on Australian television, John Safran demonstrates the innovative talent he is capable of. The program is essentially a magazine-style presentation of social rebellion and challenge to Australian institutions. In what has become the most famous (and litigious) incident, Safran and A Current Affair 'victim' Shane Paxton rummage through Ray Martin's garbage, and are soon approached by an angry Martin and his wife. Classic television in a similar vain to the work of American Michael Moore, which was deemed too controversial by the ABC to screen and was also beyond the pail for the commercial networks</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278502</url></doc>
