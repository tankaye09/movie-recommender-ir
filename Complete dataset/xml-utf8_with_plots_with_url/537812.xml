<plot>"This is the name of the engine which draws the Irish mail train on the London &amp; Northwestern Railroad, Eng. Our picture was taken from the rear of a train running parallel with, and a short distance in front of the Jennie Deans train. Throughout the run the train is kept constantly in the field of the camera, and the scene is particularly interesting when the engine takes up water while running at full speed, from a shallow trough between the rails. The water pours into the tank in such volume that it overflows in a torrent. This picture is magnificent photographically, and has made a tremendous hit wherever it has been show."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?537812</url></doc>
