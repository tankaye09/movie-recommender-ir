<plot>At 24, Asima lives with her father and works as an office girl, watching men get promoted and having their pick of the young women in the steno pool. She appears removed from it all, but actually has a secret life she guards carefully. Her father arranges a marriage meeting with a friend who has an unmarried son. Asima may have a choice: an illicit relationship with a married boss or marriage to a dull family friend. A sidewalk vendor she meets one evening may offer something else. Does a young woman in her position have choices?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406152</url></doc>
