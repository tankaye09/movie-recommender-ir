<plot>A documentary/nature film edited from over 975,000 feet of footage shot by naturalists Ed N. Harrison and Frances Roberts in North and South America over a span of several years. Narrated by Marvin Miller, it ranges from volcanic eruptions to idyllic ranges of pasture, forest and mountain ranges; and species such as the bears of the northwest to terns, sea lions and pelicans of the southern lands. A high percentage of the footage deals with the nearly-extinct Condors and their mating, eating and rearing habits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506797</url></doc>
