<plot>Ratan runs a legitimate casino, little knowing that he is under surveillance by an international gangster named Mogambha, who is unseen, but heard only. When Ratan is approached and asked to partner with Mogambha, he refuses, and is implicated in a murder of a man named Mombha. Thus entrapped, he agrees to be part of Mogambha's gang and is asked to work together with Pinky Nathani and Mike. Subsequently, Ratan is asked to kill Ajit Saxena, the Commissioner of Police, which he refuses to do. Mogambho's men then abduct his Secretary, Reddy, and his sister, Mala, and hold them for ransom until such time Ratan assassinates Ajit. Will Ratan commit this felony, or refuse at the risk of losing Reddy and Mala.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352232</url></doc>
