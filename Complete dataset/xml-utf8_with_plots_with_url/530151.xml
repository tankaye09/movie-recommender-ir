<plot>Over three hundred interviews went into the making of this short documentary, which asks people of all ages and backgrounds "Who are you?" and "What do you want out of life?" Interviewees are presented from youngest to oldest, creating a patchwork of individuals and outlooks on life. Careful attention was paid during production of the film to gathering a diverse body of interviews; from people of various ethnic backgrounds to undocumented workers to those who defy traditional boundaries of gender and sexuality. Talking Heads explores the vastly different experiences (as well the juxtapositions between them) of those who call the United States their home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530151</url></doc>
