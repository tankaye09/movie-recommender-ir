<plot>In the smallest of Florida towns a lone well driller, Joe, works gathering geological samples for a university study. Unknowingly, Joe unearths more than just primordial muck from deep below the swamp. A strange oozing liquid, is absorbed into Joe's skin and slowly transposes his sense of pain and pleasure. Unaware that he is now a victim and carrier of a horrible virus, Joe lingers in town a few extra days to woo the town's pretty diner waitress, Maria. Allen, a weekly town visitor and long time suitor of Maria's, is unaware of Joe's romantic interest. When Allen's frequent visits to see Maria are delayed by work, Allen must make a final decision to quit his job and propose to Maria or break off their relationship. When Allen makes the decision to move to Ochopee and marry Maria he arrives to find the town a changed place. Maria, often hinting at marriage, is no longer interested and somehow a darker, sullen woman. Other townspeople are nowhere to be found. Pretty storefronts are now dark tattoo parlors and seedy shops. When Allen begins to dig into the town's sudden change he finds a trail of self-inflicted bloody mutilation with fear at every turn. He also finds out about Joe. Meanwhile, back at the university that commissioned Joe to drill for the soil samples, more than expected has arrived. The oozing virus contaminates hundreds of students, causing them to seek horrifying pleasure in unspeakable acts of self torture. A university Instructor with a military background witnesses the spread of the virus and makes the decision to package the disease as the ultimate biological weapon. TERROR INSIDE is a totally new psychological thriller that reaches into the fears that haunt us all. Basic human nature keeps the TERROR INSIDE and unspoken to others. TERROR INSIDE is a bloody psychological thriller that grabs the audience much like a Hitchcock film. TERROR INSIDE is fingernails on the blackboard - for your eyes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536173</url></doc>
