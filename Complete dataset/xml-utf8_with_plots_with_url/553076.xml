<plot>Chef Herbert and Ann are soul mates. They share the same insatiable appetite for fine cuisine and fine wine. Together they have created a haven for gourmets and gourmands, running and owning their dream restaurant in Silverlake, Los Angeles, where they can enjoy the fruits of their labor. Of course running such a fine restaurant does not go unnoticed, so naturally the critics have come to sample this very delicate cuisine. One such critic, Mr. Spagat, arrives - he is the most famous and harshest food critic of them all, renowned for using his power to equally praise and degrade a restaurant in the same sentence - maybe to raise his food guide sales? He finds the liver a little too fatty, a little too tasteless, has potential but still a little too bland for his tastes. Â He decides to take a star away from Chef Herbert which has cost them dearly. A year has passed and Mr. Spagat has returned to review the restaurant yet again. This time Chef Herbert and Ann have cooked up a very special and surprising recipe, one that will tickle the taste buds and tantalize the pallet and keep you wanting more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553076</url></doc>
