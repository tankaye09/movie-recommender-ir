<plot>This movie follows Tina &amp; the B-Side Movement, Greazy Meal, The Delilahs, Iya and The Found for more than three years. Each has their own particular struggle, character and sound and FUNKYTOWN unobtrusively captures the energy, ironies, sorrows and rock 'n' roll pathos of each story, making the movie more than just a film about the music business. In the course of the movie, and in the filming of the movie, someone is brutally murdered, a band breaks up on the day they were set to sign a lucrative national record contract, throat surgery threatens to bring down a singer and a key member of another group is asked by friends and fellow band members to leave.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206919</url></doc>
