<plot>Based on the Moliere play of the same name. A woodcutter often gets drunk and beats his hot-tempered wife. One day after being beaten, she decides to take revenge on her husband. An old servant is sent to the village by a fabulously rich merchant, to look for a doctor to cure his daughter who is taken ill. Choi realizes this is her opportunity to set up her husband. She tells the servant that her husband is a painfully modest miracle doctor who will only reveal his true identity and skills after being severely beaten.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664555</url></doc>
