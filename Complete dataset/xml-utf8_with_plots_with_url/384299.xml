<plot>While pairing newly washed socks, a man discovers one is missing. His friend suggests that the wind may have blown it off the washing line. The man ventures into the outback with the unpaired sock in search of its missing partner. A scan of the landscape reveals a lone sock hanging from a tree. When compared with the sock already in his possession, the new sock does not match. A further scan of the landscape reveals another sock. This too proves to be a mismatch. The man has stumbled upon a trail of socks, which lead him into a bush odyssey to reach the mother lode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384299</url></doc>
