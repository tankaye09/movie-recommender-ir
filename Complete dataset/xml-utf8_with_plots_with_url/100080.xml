<plot>"An impressive spectacle is made by this regiment as it sweeps by the camera at a gallop. The Hussars wear very showy and beautiful uniforms; their fur-lined great coats being thrown over one shoulder, and the plumes of their shakos nodding with the swing of the horses. This scene is very fine photographically, and the faces of the men are so distinct that individuals could easily be picked out."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100080</url></doc>
