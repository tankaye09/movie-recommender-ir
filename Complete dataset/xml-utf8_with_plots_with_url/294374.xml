<plot>The "Klingenhof" is a courtyard in one of Zurich's most vibrant but slightly rundown residential quarters. The makers of this film have spent over three years documenting the people living there and their stories. And so we meet refugees from Vietnam and Kurdistan, foreign workers stranded abroad, longtime drug users and respectable senior citizens, young couples starting out in life and an old man waiting to die. The result is a fascinating tapestry of interconnected lives and an atmospheric portrait of a small place in our multicultural society.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294374</url></doc>
