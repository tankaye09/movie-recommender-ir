<plot>Sergeant Hollis, a troubled young man inside a world that has been at war for sixteen years, reveals to General Cross -- his commanding officer -- that he has invented a device to do away with the weapons of the world. Is Hollis serious, or is he delusional? If he has come up with a way to eliminate warfare, it will destroy the General's perfect world -- could that really happen? General Cross is about to find out. Based on the short story written by the great Ray Bradbury, and included in his book Long After Midnight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014545</url></doc>
