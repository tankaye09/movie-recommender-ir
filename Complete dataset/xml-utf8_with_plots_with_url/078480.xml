<plot>If your spouse wanted a job with the US Post Office, you may not find cause for alarm, right? But if the branch they are looking into is Postal Inspection, you might think again. Inspectors work to nail criminals on the vanguard of high stakes crime such as identity theft and bank fraud. Often it is a violent, deadly vocation. "Bombs, Bullets and Fraud" chronicles the history of this little known area of the government, from its inception in 1772 to its work curtailing stagecoach robberies in the Old West, and capturing the Unabomber in the '90s. These people put their lives on the line to protect everything from your assets to your children to your health, and ultimately your very life. Get inside the mind, heart, and lives of the Inspector. It'll change your view of the postal worker forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078480</url></doc>
