<plot>Winterlude is the story of Jonathan, an awkward young filmmaker, and his attempt to make a movie based on a past relationship using "real-life" couple Bob and Marianne. As the shooting begins, Marianne soon discovers that being a part of this project is more than she bargained for as Jonathan's constant manipulation of their "screen" life causes real tension between Bob and Marianne. Shot almost entirely on location in Baltimore, Md, Winterlude is a portrait of young love and misguided cinematic agendas that blurs the lines between fantasy, reality, and memory. The film also features music from local Baltimore acts such as Cass McCombs and Sonna and includes a live performance by Oxes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658469</url></doc>
