<plot>A young man riding the Metro in Los Angeles notices a young woman looking through her digital camera. They exchange glances, then she gets off the train, carrying a box of plants. As the train pulls away, he notices she has left the camera. Later that day, he looks through the photographs and can see that she's left her job and is moving to Boston. He also sees that she's taken five or six photographs of him seated on the train. Her going away cake has her first name on it, and in one of the photos, she's leaning out an apartment building. Can he figure out where she lived and find her?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017160</url></doc>
