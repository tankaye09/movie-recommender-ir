<plot>The story revolves around the good friends Fennec and Rewdalf, and their attempts to hit the jackpot (that is, robbing the legendary Jericho City on their even more legendary gold stack) in the post-apocalyptic world of Bandits. Fennec is the street-smart (or maybe desert-smart) gangleader of the infamous Wolfpack, while his sidekick Rewdalf is your average triggerhappy scottish midget who likes to hunt small marsupials with a kitchen strainer all day, and then chill out by the fireplace on a cozy bearskin rug playing old Billy Ray covers on his guitar. Well he's not all scottish # he's quarter-spanish... so maybe he isn't that much your average triggerhappy scottish midget who likes to hunt small marsupials with a kitchen strainer all day, and then chill out by the fireplace on a cozy bearskin rug playing old Billy Ray covers on his guitar, but there you go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058354</url></doc>
