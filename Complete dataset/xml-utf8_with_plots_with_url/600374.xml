<plot>A suburban family, all winks and smiles, gets together for a wedding. As champagne flows and the evening evolves, however, the family portrait falls apart. Dad can't help but flirt with the new in-law, and (accidentally?) feeds Mom's dog the wrong pills. Their daughter, in the meantime, alternates between her impotent husband and a dubiously sincere waiter. And the youngest son, who came to the party to ask Dad for money, gets ready all night for the right moment - when Dad can't run around and has to settle down to take a leak. The family portrait that started off with a smile shatters in a burst of bitter laughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600374</url></doc>
