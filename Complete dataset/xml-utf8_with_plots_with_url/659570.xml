<plot>Updated version of "Wodka, Jazz, and Perestroika" - a kind of no directors cut. Like the first edition - this is a cutting-room-result. 1989: A bunch of Austrian Jazz-Musicians enters "glasnost"-Russia with a concert-tour trough an unknown country. 1995: filmmaker Carl Andersen got the original tour-tapes from the musicians - and cut down the music. The result was too much privacy for the (ex) Band-Members. 2001: Andersen cut down much more of the music. The result: a very private look on people (musicians) from east and west and their tries, coming together in any sense.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659570</url></doc>
