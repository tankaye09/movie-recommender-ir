<plot>Singer/Actress Cyndi Lauper tours Coney Island, New York and is perplexed by the way every vendor at Coney Island seems to look like her friend Aida, but the real Aida is nowhere to be found. As she scours the park looking for Aida, she recounts to the audience her career in music, some of her childhood adventures, and introduces many of her popular music videos, from 1984-1994.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?122447</url></doc>
