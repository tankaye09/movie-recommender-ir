<plot>Rachel Watson's finally returning home from a tour as a reservist chopper pilot, but soon after her husband Dan and 16-year old daughter Clara meet her at the airport strange things begin to happen. The ghost of a boy dressed in blue seems to be haunting her. She wakes up screaming and covered in blood. Pictures of her are missing from the wall. Odd voices are on the phone. And a strange middle-easterner is in her house, slowly seducing her daughter, and is somehow in league with the unbalanced wife of a soldier Rachel slept with in Iraq. Soon Rachel begins to realize that reality is not at all as it seems, that something that happened to her over there seems to be changing everything here, and that she's in a fight for her very life - and that of her only daughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159696</url></doc>
