<plot>Woody and Wally share an apartment building. Woody's favorite pastime is playing golf... it's just a shame he plays inside the house instead of outside. Finally, Wally breaks his club and tells him not to make any more noise. Woody decides to forget his troubles by taking a bath. His bathtub is coin-operated and when he inserts a dime for the water, it falls down the drain. Woody is not about to part with any money and is determined to retreive his dime... even if it means driving Wally to the nut house in the process!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060846</url></doc>
