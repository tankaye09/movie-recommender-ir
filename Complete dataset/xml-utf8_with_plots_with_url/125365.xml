<plot>Dance Around the Pool lifts the veil of secrecy that cloaks and fosters pedophilia, as a grown victim turns the camera on her abuser in search of answers, acceptance, and possible reconciliation. The film depicts the personal story of Director Stephanie Rauber as she journeys to confront her father- the man that sexually abused her and her sister when they were children. With startling courage and touches of irony and humor, the film looks behind the doors of a seemingly ordinary home, and reveals the anguish that hounds the children of a pedophile. In stark interviews with her father, the director delves into the justifications and twisted rationale of an unrepentant pedophile. After journeying to confront her father, the director learns if the man who damaged her as a child, can help contribute to her healing as an adult.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125365</url></doc>
