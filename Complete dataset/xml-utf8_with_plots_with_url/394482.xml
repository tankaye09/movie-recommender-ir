<plot>Since its inception in the wake of 9-11, NEW YORK VOICES has provided a unique perspective on New York that can't be found anywhere else. Initially conceived as a way to help the city heal and deal, NEW YORK VOICES served to create a bridge of understanding between real New Yorkers and expert opinions. Presenting a cross-section of smart and inspiring people, NEW YORK VOICES focused on helping people pick up the pieces and to begin the task of rebuilding throughout a year of struggle and grief. Over the past two years NEW YORK VOICES has become a forum for new voices about building community in the five boroughs. Each episode of NEW YORK VOICES contains strong, character-driven stories about real New Yorkers as well as intelligent conversation with authorities on a diverse array of topics. By contrasting the insights of New York insiders with the viewpoints of everyday people, NEW YORK VOICES uncovers the many connections that lie at the heart of city life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394482</url></doc>
