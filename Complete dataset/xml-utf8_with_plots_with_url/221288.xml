<plot>GRAFFITI GIRL is 8 MILE set in the world of graffiti. Angel Rodriguez is a headstrong teenager who channels her hopes and dreams for the future into her painting. But when her entry for a community mural doesn't rate, she's heartbroken and becomes determined to find her own place in the art world, her own way. That's when Miguel Badalin - from the notorious graffiti crew Reyes Del Norte - opens her eyes to an underground world of graf tags and turf wars. She's blown away by this bad boy's undeniable talent and finds herself drawn to his dangerous charm. Soon she's running with Miguel's crew, pushing her skills to the limit and beginning to emerge as the artist she always dreamed she could be. But Miguel's world is dangerous and Angel must decide what she cares about most before the artist inside of her can truly break free.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221288</url></doc>
