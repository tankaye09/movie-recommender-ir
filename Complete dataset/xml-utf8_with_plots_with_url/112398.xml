<plot>After the collapse of the communism number of the institutionalized orphans and poor family's children ended in the street. The Jesuit Priest Jean Magnan arrives in Satu-Mare (NW of Transylvania) in the fall of 1993. Strongly impressed by the precarious circumstances of the streets children, supported by his French and Romanian friends he starts to help them. Testifying his belief in God, his thrust in the humankind, he helped to transform not just points of view but lives. Supported by some Romanian and French friends he founds a NGO (Freres Romania) with the purpose to help the young orphans and street children to integrate in the society. Iulia and Paul are only two of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112398</url></doc>
