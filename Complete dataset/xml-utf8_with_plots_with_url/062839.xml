<plot>Alone, a newly arrived immigrant comes to New York City to take his first steps toward an uncertain future, and unexpectedly embarks on a journey to self-discovery. Becoming American is about having faith, being yourself, and beginning a new life. Once a man has been born in a country there are nets thrown at him to restrain him from flying. Nationality, language, religion among others bind him. As one immigrates to a new country is as one is born again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062839</url></doc>
