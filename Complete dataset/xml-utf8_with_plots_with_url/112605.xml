<plot>This entry in the "Community Sing" series (production number 5657) was produced at the request of the U.S. Army Motion Picture Service for showing at U.S. military installions around the world during the Christmas season. Dick Leibert, at the organ as always (when Don Baker wasn't), plays while the Song Spinners (always on hand after Ben K. Blake took over the production of the series for Columbia) sang "Silent Night," "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing", "The First Noel", "Oh, Come All Ye Faithful" and "It Came Upon the Midnight Clear." Columbia reissued this on December 6, 1947, and several times after that when they finally figured out it was playable once every year. One of the few in the series the audience didn't need a bouncing ball to be able to sing along.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112605</url></doc>
