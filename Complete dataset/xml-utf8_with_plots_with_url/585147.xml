<plot>An adolescent boy sneaks into his grandfather's office. His grandfather catches him but is far more interested in retelling his standard WWII story for the umpteenth time. The boy plays along with him to avoid punishment for sneaking into the office. As the grandfather tells the tale, the boy amuses himself with a fantasy of himself as his grandfather, the captain of a destroyer in WWII. It is not long before the fantasy collides with bitter reality and the boy acknowledges a fateful decision his grandfather made during the war.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585147</url></doc>
