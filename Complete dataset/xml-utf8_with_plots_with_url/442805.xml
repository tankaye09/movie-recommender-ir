<plot>"This picture has been very popular wherever it has been shown on the Biograph. To begin with, the film is unusually fine photographically, and the picture is taken from a point of view which shows the immense distances of Camp Wikoff with its multitude of tents in the background. The President, with Vice-President Hobart and Secretary of War Russell A. Alger, appear in an open carriage escorted by a large number of officers, notable among whom are Gen. Wheeler, Gen. Gates, and Col. John Jacob Astor. This picture is brought to a rather humorous ending by the efforts of a newspaper photographer to get Col. Astor to pose for a picture. He is unsuccessful, and as the gallant colonel gallops away, the photographer's chagrin is apparent."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442805</url></doc>
