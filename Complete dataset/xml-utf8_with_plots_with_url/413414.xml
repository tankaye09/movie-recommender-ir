<plot>Only In L.A. is a satirical romantic comedy about 5 people in Los Angeles struggling with their creative ambitions and screwed up relationships. After a string of failed affairs, Raiko, a commercial producer who hates her job, has set out to make a one woman documentary about "Flakey L.A. Relationships". The film follows 5 charmingly neurotic characters through one summer in Los Angeles as they become subjects of Raiko's documentary, attempting to reinvent themselves and their relationships. A playful, comic look at single life in the city of angels, Only In L.A. is a freewheeling fun filled slice of L.A. life. As Raiko says "The odds of finding a successful relationship in Los Angeles are about one in ten thousand!".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413414</url></doc>
