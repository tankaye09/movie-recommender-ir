<plot>The Russians found it a most difficult problem to make any headway in Korea, and the men met with great hardships. Here we see them towing huge cannon on sleds and arriving at a hut, where they take shelter for the night. All the horrors of war are depicted in this marvelous life-motion picture. Everything, as far as the eye can see, is covered with heavy snow, and the men march with difficulty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471158</url></doc>
