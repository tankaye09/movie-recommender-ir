<plot>A late night dinner party of lawyers goes awry when it's host, TAYLOR, reveals a secret drug he's discovered in his attic called TC3. He discloses that it was pioneered by his grandfather while he was in the service of the U.S. Army in the 1950's. TC3 was designed to break down the neural barrier in the brain which filters out 90% of the information the primary senses perceive. So anyone who ingests TC3 would experience the true state of the physical universe around them. Even more strange is the fact that the drug's effects seem to last for hours, but in fact occur only for a few seconds. Taylor's friend, ROB, inebriated and curious, is persuaded to take the drug. As he's dragged deeper and deeper into the world of the TC3, a new universe is revealed. A universe where he is merely a pawn being studied by something else. Something not human.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?532567</url></doc>
