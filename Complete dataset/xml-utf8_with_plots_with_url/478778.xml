<plot>Moti sells gurd in the market. He collects the raw material and takes them to an older woman, Mahjubhi, who makes exemplary gurd. Moti loves a village girl but is unable to afford to pay for the maher (dowry/marriage expenses) to her father. So he decides to marry Mahjubhi, proposes to her, which she accepts, they marry, and she moves in with him. Moti extracts a lot of work from Mahjubhi so that he can save enough money to pay for his marriage expenses. Shortly after he saves enough money, he decides to give Mahjubhi talaq (divorce), accusing her of infidelity. Shortly after that he marries the village girl, and he goes back to his business of selling gurd. With the skills of Mahjubhi taken away, will Moti survive on his own, and will his new wife be able to offer him the support and skills in order to enable him to survive in his trade.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?478778</url></doc>
