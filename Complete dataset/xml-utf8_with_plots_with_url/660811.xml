<plot>The men are seen working a jigger rocker. These men took the jigger from California to the Klondike. They are working on a bar of Bonanza Creek and earning $20 to the man per day. This is a primitive method of mining, the gold passing through holes in a piece of sheet iron and being caught in a blanket placed underneath.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660811</url></doc>
