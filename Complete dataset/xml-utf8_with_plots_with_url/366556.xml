<plot>A simple story about a 13-year-old girl in an existential crisis. Her name is Merrilee. She is an only child. Introspective and out of place, her social nexus is nominal. Home is her solace, but her parents make a shaky bedrock: her mother is overbearing and weak and her father is distant and stressful. Nonetheless, her relationship to them is the strongest and most prevalent in her life. After a serious revelation from her father Merrilee's reality begins to fracture and she realizes that her family life is more unstable than she had always believed. Not your typical teen angst film, "Merrily, Merrily" explores the lines of perception, self-awareness and being a character in your own life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366556</url></doc>
