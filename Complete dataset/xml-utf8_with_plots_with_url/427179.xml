<plot>On the morning of December 7, 1941, Imperial Japanese forces made a surprise attack on the American forces based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In an instant, war began for America. In exclusive interviews, survivors of the battle share their memories, recalling the terror, confusion and bravery of those who suddenly found the peaceful Hawaiian paradise shattered by bombs and bullets wreaking death and devastation all around them. Soldiers, sailors, pilots and civilians give their riveting personal eyewitness testimony recounting the heroism and tragedy of that fateful day. Historic archival films, including recently discovered color footage, plus dramatic recreations highlight this presentation, which also deals with some of the controversial questions surrounding the attack. This is a tale of the shock, the outrage and the bitter resolution of those who lived through the raid. Relive that incredible day through the memories of those who survived and whose experiences put you there in the midst of the catastrophic attack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427179</url></doc>
