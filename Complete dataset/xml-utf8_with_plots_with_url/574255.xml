<plot>Award-winning playwright Brian Clark creates a theatre company of older actors to devise and perform a play about ageing. Enter: Two mistresses, a sex-club manager, a bigoted maiden-aunt - and the man who has controlled all their lives, the charismatic George! But its what goes on in real life that makes for real drama. One actor leaves under tragic circumstances. A second flounces off stage just before opening night. Others reveal their own true-life stories - more poignant, disturbing and transformative than anything a playwright could dream up. Independent film-makers Barbara Myers and Paul Loman went behind the scenes every step of the way - to bring the real story of the Making of George to the screen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?574255</url></doc>
