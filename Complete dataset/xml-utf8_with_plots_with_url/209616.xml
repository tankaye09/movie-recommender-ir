<plot>Educated and intelligent, Ganga lives a poor lifestyle with her parents in a small village in India. Shankar comes to her rescue while she is being molested, but ends up being temporarily crippled. One day while performing prayers along the river bank, she chastises Ranjit, the son of wealthy Thakur Vijay Singh. Vijay is impressed by Ganga and arranges their marriage. Shankar's mom approaches Ganga's parents, but is humiliated, as they do not want Ganga to marry a crippled man. Ganga agrees to marry Ranjit, but on the day of the wedding, Ranjit accuses her of having an affair with another man, and refuses to marry her. Shankar again comes to her rescue, gets the culprit to confess, with Ranjit apologizing and offering to marry her. But Ganga refuses, and instead gets married to Shankar, much to the chagrin of her dad, who refuses to bless this marriage. The marriage does take place, and Ganga moves in with Shankar and his family, consisting of his mom, paternal grandmother, brother, Vishnu, and his wife, Jugni. Ganga does not realize that she may have landed from the frying pan into the fire as Jugni does not approve of her, and together with Ranjit, will soon turn Ganga and Shankar's lives upside down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209616</url></doc>
