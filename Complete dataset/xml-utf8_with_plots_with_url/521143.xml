<plot>Blackfeet poet Darrell Robes Kipp, a man striving to save the Blackfeet language, unexpectedly joins the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission to make sure that the American Indian side of history is told. Quirky classical composer Rob Kapilow travels west from Lincoln Center to find inspiration for a commissioned symphony about the Lewis and Clark expedition. When Rob meets Darrell and asks him to collaborate with him on words that will tell the Indian side of history through the new symphony, their "odd couple" collaboration creates a provocative piece of music that connects the Blackfeet seat of Browning, Montana to the rarefied air of symphony halls across the country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521143</url></doc>
