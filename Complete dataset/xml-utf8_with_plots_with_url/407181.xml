<plot>Comedy/drama about how a small-town mom, who owns the local flower shop, realizes that she must die in order for her college Literature professor son (charismatic but troubled) to truly live. An independent teenage daughter who speaks one word at a time, and a touch of magic realism from the local Psychic Gypsy add intriguing layers to the mix.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407181</url></doc>
