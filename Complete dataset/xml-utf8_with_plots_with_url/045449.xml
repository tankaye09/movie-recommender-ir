<plot>Arjuns believes, that he dictates his own destiny. Not some silly lines running on his palms. He faces the stigma of being different and absence of lines on his palms from an early childhood. As unfortunate events begin to shake his inner core. He fights his opponents in the ring while destiny is set dead against him outside the ring. His fathers dream of winning the championship become Arjuna's nightmare as his life slips like the sand that slips smoothly out of his blank hands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045449</url></doc>
