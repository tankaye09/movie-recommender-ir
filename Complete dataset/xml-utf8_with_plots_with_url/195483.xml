<plot>You have all seen fire engines running to a fire, and many of them. It remained for us to produce the first moving picture of a fire engine at work right in the midst of a great fire, showing the engineer attending to his engine, the great monster puffing and snorting and emitting cinders and smoke at a great rate. This is a fine picture, because it is true to life. Try this, and please your audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195483</url></doc>
