<plot>It's 1972 and the Mafia crime families are at war, but that isn't enough to stop a young, unknown 'John Gotti' (qv), who has big ideas and even bigger ambitions. In order to put an end to a two decades' conflict, Gotti pulls together an unlikely crew made up of one member from each crime family to pull off a silver bullion heist. If Gotti can keep these criminal misfits from killing each other and succeed with this problem-riddled heist he will secure himself a spot in mafia history. This gang of misfit gangsters, hijackers and wanna-bees, all in their late 20's, hang out playing cards at a gambling den known as the "Sinatra Club" owned by Crazy 'Salvatore Polisi' (qv), the narrator of our story. At the time, nobody is getting "made" because all the families are at war. What's worse, the bosses have no idea who John and his underlings are. Determined to make a name for himself, John masterminds a scheme that will either squash the beef among the five families or get him and his whole crew killed. First he has to get his mentor and idol Charlie Fatico, a powerful captain in the Gambino crime family, to get the go ahead from the big boss Carlo Gambino. With the old man's blessing, the wheels are set in motion for a heist like no other. The plan is simple: use a guy from each family through the Club, hijack an armored truck loaded with silver bullion, and give each boss a piece of the action. What could be simpler? At the end, every Mafia boss will know who John Gotti is and, more importantly, owe him for helping end the bloodshed while enriching their coffers. He will be in the bigs and finally be a "somebody." The only problem with this simple plan is that it is anything but simple. As the clock ticks, the crew find more holes in the plan than in the mobsters who are getting whacked all over town. With the bosses of all five families waiting for their piece, the boys are off the poker table and on the street literally playing for their lives!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?591046</url></doc>
