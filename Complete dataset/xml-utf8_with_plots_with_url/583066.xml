<plot>In the second entry of the popular Hazards of Helen series, Helen, is temporarily assigned as a telegraph operator at Quarry Depot; bad blood springs up between two men who are seeking Helen's favor, but to whom she has remained impartial. After one of the men explodes some dynamite, burying a score of men under a mass of earth and boulders, smashing a telegraph pole and severing the wires, Helen climbs another pole, splices the wires, and sends a message for help. One of Helen's suitors is killed, the other one is badly injured, and Helen remains uncommitted to seek further hazards the following week.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583066</url></doc>
