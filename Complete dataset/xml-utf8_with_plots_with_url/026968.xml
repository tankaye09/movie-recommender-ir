<plot>Sorbs and Jackie are members of one of the greatest air bands that has never been heard. Jackie, due to pressure from his room mate Burt, starts to see that this air music thing may be going nowhere. The group is ripped apart one day when Sorbs catches Jackie cheating on him, with a real guitar. Sorbs splits up the group and they go their separate ways. Jackie tries to give real music a shot but to no avail. Sorbs tries to push on by himself but realizes that an air-drummer with out an air-lead guitarist is nothing. So Sorbs sets about finding someone new to join the band and just he is about to give up the game in walks Jackie and blows him away with a great tasty riff. Jackie wants back in the band and Sorbs is only too happy to oblige. 'The Springsteens' are back and better than ever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026968</url></doc>
