<plot>On the campus of Ford University, the adventuresome star photographer of the campus newspaper finds himself confined to a wheelchair in his dorm room while a broken leg mends. With only the occasional distraction of visits from his best friend Greg and girlfriend, Lisa Love, his attention is naturally drawn to the courtyard outside his 'Dorm Window' and the occupants of the dorm rooms, which surround it. Soon he is consumed by the private dramas of the student lives, which play themselves out before his eyes. There is 'Miss Infatuation,' so desperate for the companionship of the school jock that everyday after class she dances in front of a photo collage of the jocks newspaper clippings. Then there is the jock that's in his senior year and preparing to go pro and his girlfriend since grade school that just found out she's pregnant. After a study session with the jock, 'Miss Infatuation' comes up missing. Where did she go? What happen the night the jock came to visit her? Will any of this endanger his chances of going pro, and his relationship with his girlfriend?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156686</url></doc>
