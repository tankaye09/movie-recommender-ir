<plot>A short documentary that takes a hip, gritty look at the reality of life on the street for kids with three strikes against them: They're young. They're gay. They're homeless. Queer youth make up approximately 20 to 50 percent of the 20,000 homeless young people in New York City. Homophobia, poverty and mental illness put them on the streets, where they struggle with violence, drugs, sex work and daily life in the youth shelter system. See the issues through their eyes, in their own words.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?451519</url></doc>
