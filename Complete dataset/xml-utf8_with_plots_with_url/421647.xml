<plot>Pangea is the name for the land mass when all the continents were joined. On May 10, 2008, groups around the globe gathered via satellite to see the world through each other's eyes, thanks to the medium of film. Documentarian Jehan Noujaim conceived the day and used her TED grant to get it rolling. In this collection of excerpts, celebrity hosts introduce short films and interviews, many featuring the dispossessed, refugees, or children. Some are film clips shot on cell phones. There are montages grouped around human universals, such as love, hope, laughter, and coming of age. From Lebanon and from Israel victims of war talk to each other across sectarian divisions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421647</url></doc>
