<plot>There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was ever produced or distributed at this time. It's yet another bogus title emanating from the error-filled Universal Silents by Richard E. Braff; the alleged release date is bogus as well. Most likely, it's a working title for some other film, released at some other time, under a different title.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?571304</url></doc>
