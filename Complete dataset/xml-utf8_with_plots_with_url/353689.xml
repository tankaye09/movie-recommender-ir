<plot>"The action in this picture is so natural that it has met with marked approval wherever it has been shown on the Biograph. The scene is laid in a village street. A painter is coming up the middle of the road with his ladder on his shoulder. Some distance behind him comes a bicycle rider. Two pretty girls are walking on the sidewalk in the opposite direction. The painter is watching the girls; and not noticing the bicycle rider, turns his ladder just in time for the wheelman to run full tilt into it. The wheelman takes a header; the painter drops his ladder, and the two start in at once on a free fight. The girls come out and try to separate the combatants; and the action throughout is very spontaneous and amusing."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353689</url></doc>
