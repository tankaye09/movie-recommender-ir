<plot>As the 100 members of the MGM Symphony Orchestra take their seats, an off-screen narrator introduces the music and provides the credits to the cinematographer, editor, and sound supervisor. The music is Otto Nicolai's "Overature to the Merry Wives of Windsor," conducted by Johnny Green in the MGM Concert Hall. Green and the other men are in white tie and tails, the four women are in black. Most of the film consists of long takes, slow pans, some camera movement including crane shots, as well as zooming slowly out and in. Green conducts, the orchestra plays, and the film ends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419044</url></doc>
