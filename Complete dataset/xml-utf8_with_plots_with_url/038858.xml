<plot>A surly wheelchair-bound child (Meena) lives in a group home with other orphans, where she despises all and sundry and commonly vents her anger at the staff or at other children. At a function for the children, movie star Rajnikanth comes by, who receives much of the same treatment from her, but on later watching his films, she takes a liking to him and starts writing him letters, the superstar is responsive and develops a close relationship with her. A vehicle for Rajnikanth to get a new image appeal, as 'Rajni Uncle' for children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038858</url></doc>
