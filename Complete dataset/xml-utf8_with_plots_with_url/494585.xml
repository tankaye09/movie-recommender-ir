<plot>Based on actual events surrounding a New Zealand drug scandal that involved the murder of Martin Johnstone of the UK, in the early 1070's. Johnstone had been dubbed "Mr Asia" by international police who were about to arrest him. Then when police were about to arrest his killer, that person was killed while in Police custody. Some feel the real "Mr Asia" is alive today. The film tries to tell about private efforts to try and reach the real killer and villain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494585</url></doc>
