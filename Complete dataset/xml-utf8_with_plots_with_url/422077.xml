<plot>"On the right a river is lost to view as the track curves towards the hills. Then a straightaway thousand yards, as the train approaches a cleft in the hills. On the left a giant steam shovel and scores of gravel cars. Then into a rock cut, and out again. For a short moment the rails glisten like shining ribbons. Another slight curve and a broad valley greets us. Kittanning Point on the right and far away up in the hills the Altoona reservoir. Under a bridge, past a signal tower, and a broad expanse of meadow and forest, bathed in sunshine."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422077</url></doc>
