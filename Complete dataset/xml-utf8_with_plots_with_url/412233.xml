But when Marcos returns from a successful audition one evening to find his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor, the couple's American dream quickly dissolves. At the hospital, Marcos learns that his wife's condition could keep her there for quite some time. Feeling the emotional and financial burden of his wife's trauma, Marcos must endure to ensure that continuous treatment is provided to his wife.
