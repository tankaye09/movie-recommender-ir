<plot>A California family receives a notice that they must make a payment immediately, or else be forced out of their home. The payment must be made at an office in Hollywood, and so Grandpa, his granddaughter, and his grandson Orville all go together, full of excitement at the chance to see some movie stars. Grandpa misses the train, leaving the other two to continue alone. Once in Hollywood, they pass by a bank robbery in progress, which Orville mistakes for a movie scene. He rushes into the action, and is taken by one of the holdup gang, who leaves him unconscious and dressed like a woman in the room of a hotel detective. This creates considerable difficulty and embarrassment both for Orville and for the detective.</plot><plot>A California family receives a notice that they must make a payment immediately, or else be forced out of their home.
