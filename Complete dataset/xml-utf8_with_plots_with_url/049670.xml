<plot>AT THE EDGE OF THE BED is based upon a story by Guy de Maupassant. A couple face the disintegration of their marriage after returning from a party one evening. The man, whose extramarital affairs are no secret to his wife, is peeved that she flirted openly with a mutual friend. The woman, surprised at her husband's nascent jealousy, is determined to discover the cause. What follows is an arrangement which creates an unusual opportunity for their marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049670</url></doc>
