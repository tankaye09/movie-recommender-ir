<plot>Alice is married to a poor and abusive man and has started an affair with Peter, a wealthy and gentle lover who would do anything for her. Meeting at their secret rendez-vouz, he finally convinces her to leave her husband and run away together to far-away lands, but in the midst of their joy, her husband barges in... armed. Running for their lives, Alice and Peter try to escape, but a sinister plot slowly unravels that proves, in film noir, nothing is as it appears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?029882</url></doc>
