<plot>Josh recently got a new cell phone and gets lots of wrong-number messages. Among them is a woman named Crystal who's desperately trying to reach a guy named Sam that seems to have disappeared without a word. Josh informs Crystal that she's got the wrong number, but Crystal would catch at a straw. Josh feels sorry for her and eventually agrees to help her find Sam whom he's never met. However, little does he know that he is going to experience a series of surreal events that will blur his sense of reality and will put him in a place he's never expected to be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151724</url></doc>
