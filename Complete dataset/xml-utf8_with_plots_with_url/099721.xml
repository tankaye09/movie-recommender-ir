<plot>"Changing the World on Vacation" is a social impact documentary that explores the controversial trend "Volun-tourism" (the merger of adventure travel and aid work) by following an American grassroots NGO in Cambodia that built a school for 540 children in a rural village and financially sustains this project through volunteer-travelers. With intimate access to the president of the grassroots NGO, the film uncovers the personal and political potholes that stand in the way of doing aid work responsibly and joins three groups of volunteers on their trips to Cambodia, contrasting the life-changing effects of their own journey and their impact for the local communities. The film furthers an inclusive dialogue for more sustainable aid practices, highlighting the potential and dangers of Volun-tourism (the largest growing segment in the tourism and non-profit industry) and is a catalyst for discussion that raises crucial questions about the nature of giving and our individual potential to be activists for change.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099721</url></doc>
