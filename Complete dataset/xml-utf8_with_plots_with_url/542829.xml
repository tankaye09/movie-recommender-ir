<plot>In two distinct stories, characters find that controlling life is never easy. In Extraction, Julie discovers that choosing someone to help her out of trouble puts her into even more. She chooses a woman to kill her father and finds that this professional has a moral standard herself: If Julie has lied, she will be the contract. Sentry teaches that when you strive for ultimate control, you often achieve the opposite. A veteran on a park bench discusses his disgust with the state of the world - everyone is a whiner. His own stout moral outrage is a sign of his own mental illness, perhaps a result of his own mental rigidity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542829</url></doc>
