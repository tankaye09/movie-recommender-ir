<plot>On July 4th, there will be no celebration for Lou Weaver. Instead, he finds himself falling deeper into a hole, struggling to find clarity in his life. He spends most of this "Independence Day" inside of his own head, contemplating his own independence, though his pessimism prevents him from finding it. Enter Bobby Styles, who intends to provide the fireworks # whether Lou is prepared, or not. Over the course of the day, each of Lou's "friends" weaves his own unique thread through the Mutual Admiration Society. There's Cooter Haynes, a perpetual stoner with a penchant for prophecy, and Brooksy Sterling, a slumping sexual deviant. Mickey McQueeney can best be described as an unintelligent thug, and Richie Wexler as the self-indulgent resident drug dealer. Then there's Troy Vank, a seemingly doomed circus clown, who may just have the last laugh, after all, and "Al Mighty", the mere existence of whom seems to be a mystery to the rest. Questions abound, but when the day is done, and long after the grand finale has reached its denouement, one question transcends them all: How can Lou's life seem so simple, yet be so very complicated? Welcome to the Mutual Admiration Society. Dig deeper.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382993</url></doc>
