<plot>Medium Synopsis After his death from a massive coronary, Eric Kamen's head was severed, then cryogenically frozen. He was supposed to wake up in a bright, distant future, free to live a new life, in a new body. Instead he wakes to a cold, uncaring dystopia, with only a pair of callous technicians to greet him upon his re-birth. Though blessed with a young new body, Eric discovers he has no home, no money. Most devastatingly, Eric discovers that his wife Grace, who was also supposed to be frozen at the moment of her death, expired before a preservation team could reach her. Lost and alone, Eric is left to fend for himself in a future far beyond his comprehension.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?205469</url></doc>
