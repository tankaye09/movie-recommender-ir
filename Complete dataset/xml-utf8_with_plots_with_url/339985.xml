<plot>In far off India they employ very strenuous means of loading cattle on the steamer. A broadside view of a huge ocean liner forms the background of the picture. In the foreground is a flat-bottomed boat or scow, on the deck of which are grouped the cattle to be swung on board. A rope is secured to the horns of the cattle, and they are hoisted aboard by a windlass. The scene is most novel and thrilling, as the huge beasts come up over the side of the ship, kicking and pawing the air in their frantic attempts to disengage themselves from the rope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339985</url></doc>
