<plot>Two couples competed in this daily game show, whose centerpiece was a game loosely based on the dice game Yahtzee. Host Lange read a question, with the first couple to answer correctly allowed to set into motion one of five spinners with the numbers 1 through 6 on them. Each additional correct answer allowed the teams to build combinations. Payoffs ranged from $50 for one pair (e.g., 1-1-2-3-4) to $200 for five of a kind (e.g., 5-5-5-5-5). The first team to $250 won the game and played a bonus round, where the teams spun the spinners, with combinations offering higher payoffs of up to $10,000.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510520</url></doc>
