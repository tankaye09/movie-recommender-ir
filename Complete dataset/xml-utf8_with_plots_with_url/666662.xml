<plot>Newlyweds Ned and Vicki Bliss have a fight and Vicki leaves saying that she is going home to Mom and Dad and that Ned will never see her again! When Vicki doesn't return the next day, Ned figures there was more truth to her statement. Ned decides to visit her parents whom he had never met. When Ned reaches their home he is greeted with the news that Vicki is not there. What Ned doesn't know is Mary and Will Alden are not Vicki's parents but impostors. Ned notices Vicki's parents are unaware of any of the details that Vicki had shared with him of them and her childhood and Ned's suspicion begins. The parents are eager to get Ned out of the house and back on the road to find his wife and their daughter but Ned comes up with one delay after another to allow him time to do a little investigating of her parents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666662</url></doc>
