<plot>This is one of a series of admirable living pictures, posed by competent artists, and faithfully representing well-known art masterpieces. At the opening of each picture, curtains are thrown aside by two pages, the picture remains for a short interval in complete repose, and the curtains are drawn. In other words, these living pictures are shown exactly as in first-class vaudeville theatres, and were prepared with equal care. "Faith" by Sarony.
