<plot>The Commissioner of Police is impressed with the diligence and bravery by one of his officers named Vijay, and asks him to re-locate to a lawless town by the name of Shona Pur, which Vijay accepts. He arrives there incognito, and is faced with several challenges, including lackadaisical policemen, who have never arrested anyone. He sets out to put things right. He meets with a young woman by the name of Shanti, who is on the look-out for buried treasure. Vijay and Shanti both fall in love with each other, and both set out to locate this treasure. In order to do this they will have to go through underground caverns, snake-pits, and a gang of thieves who are known to kill anyone who get in their way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490810</url></doc>
