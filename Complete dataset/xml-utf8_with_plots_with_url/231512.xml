<plot>Laurel and Hardy have just received fine jobs at Kwickway Washing Machine Co. where their first assignment is to go door to door trying to sell a washing machine. They stop at a high rise of terraced steps and see a lady waving to them, they think: a customer, so they carry the washing machine up the stairs and all she wants to know is if they would mail a letter for her. So the boys carry the washing machine back down the steps, stumble over themselves and their hats fly off. They retrieve them and put them on the wrong heads. They end up carrying the washing machine up and down the steps a few times and losing their hats. Then soon wind up in the street where everyone engages into a hat war. Soon the police arrive and cart off everyone but Stan and Ollie, who put on the wrong hats again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231512</url></doc>
