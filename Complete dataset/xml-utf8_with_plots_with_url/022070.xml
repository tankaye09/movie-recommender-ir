<plot>Our bosses thought it would be fun to produce an amateur comedy competition during HBO's 2007 Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen. So we lined-up celebrity host Andy Milonakis from MTV, judges like Nora Dunn from Saturday Night Live, and Top-40 band 'Bowling For Soup' for entertainment. For contestants, we teamed up with Ziddio.com (a YouTube-style site) and held a nationwide talent search for amateur comedians. Interested contestants posted a video of their work on line, and America voted for the most funny. The top vote getters won a trip to Aspen to be contestants on our show. The results of our efforts...'Accidentally Famous' - a show celebrating up-and-coming comedians who'll soon be headlining future comedy festivals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022070</url></doc>
