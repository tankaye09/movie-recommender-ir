<plot>On the first day of Ramadan, Hasan arrives at a railway station in the middle of the Anatolian wilderness. He has with him a young wife and a young daughter. He has heard that the small station community needs an imam to lead the prayer ritual and teach the children Koran during the holy month. Before too long, realizing how aloof he is with his wife and daughter and through a series of events, the townspeople decide that for all his impassioned preaching, his mellifluous calls to prayer and committed worship, Hasan is essentially a cruel and heartless man and they start to develop an almost hostile attitude towards the imam.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023453</url></doc>
