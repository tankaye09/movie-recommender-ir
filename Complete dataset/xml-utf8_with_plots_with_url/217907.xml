<plot>Trudy is the girl of Ryan's dreams. Only catch is Trudy is waiting for God to reveal Mr. Right to her and Ryan is not exactly what she had in mind. When Ryan and his buddies discover this they devise a plan behind Ryan's back to convince Trudy that God has chosen her to be with Ryan. With less than brilliant ideas each plan backfires and each scheme gets more ridiculous in this gut busting comedy as his friends Jack, Lon, and Bridgett dig themselves deeper and deeper into trouble as they try to rationalize and justify each hair brain scheme to convince Trudy that she is meant to be with Ryan. What happens when you play God with someone's life?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217907</url></doc>
