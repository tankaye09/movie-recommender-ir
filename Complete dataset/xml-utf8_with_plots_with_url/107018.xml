<plot>Journey to snowy Siberia for a portrait of determined youth in quest of athletic glory. Meet Alexander and Roman, two boys on their way to circus big-top fame. These nimble youngsters are definitely born with a gift, but they also know their talents must be honed to perfection. So each day they're off to the gymnasium to practice under the watchful eye of their coach. There, along with dozens of other talented kids, the boys practice juggling, tumbling, high-wire walking, and even contorting their agile young bodies into human pretzels. All culminating in a winter holiday performance in front of a packed hall of costumed revelers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107018</url></doc>
