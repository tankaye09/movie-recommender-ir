<plot>Aspiring filmmaker Max is forced to confront his inner child. Revolving around his neurotic and often comic observations, we meet the women of his past: the one who was his first, the one who broke his heart, and the one who gave him hope. Eventually, Max learns to accept love for what it is rather than an idealized notion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?505937</url></doc>
