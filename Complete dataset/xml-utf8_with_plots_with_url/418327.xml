<plot>By this point, the OutRun series had revolutionized the third-person perspective style of racing games. This time the levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike in the predecessors, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the roads are dogged with other cars to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418327</url></doc>
