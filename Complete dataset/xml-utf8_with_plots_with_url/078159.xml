<plot>The Bulgarian emigrants who settled in Bessarabia were unlucky; they would become now part of the Russian Empire, now of Romania; now of the USSR, now would be split between Moldova and the Ukraine. And yet Bulgarian element has survived! The Bolgrad's Highschool itself, a beautiful building in the past, is now deserted, overgrown by weeds and with bruised walls. What we see is remain of past grandeur in the architecture and a thin thread of memory in souls of people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078159</url></doc>
