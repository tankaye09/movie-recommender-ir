<plot>This is filled with interest for those who have never seen the middle poor class of Europe travel on the Railroad. The trains are two stories high and built in compartments. This picture shows a train arriving at a station, stopping to let off passengers who alight from the upper and lower compartments and scatter in all directions. The figures are large and the faces easily seen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200529</url></doc>
