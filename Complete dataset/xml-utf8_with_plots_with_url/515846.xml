<plot>Filmmaker Paola Mendoza and her grandmother, Nubia Vestal, visit Nubia's home in Waveland, Mississippi, which was flattened by Hurricane Katrina. Paola fishes around the ruin, finding a few photographs and dishes. Nubia remains cheerful. The two go for a walk down the devastated street; Paola asks her grandmother a few questions, "What would you most like now in life?," "Why would you stay here?," "What have you learned from this?" Nubia, who's 70 and recently widowed, is still standing; she answers Paola's questions with humor. They halt their walk so Nubia can pay a visit to her State Farm Agent. Will he be like a good neighbor; will he be there?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?515846</url></doc>
