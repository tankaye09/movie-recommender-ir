<plot>Olive Prepares was inspired by, and is based on, time I spent working at home as an artist, living with fellow animator and filmmaker Helen Hill. Olive has spent too long cooped up by herself trying to make art. She starts to see things as drawn animation. Then, a new tenant catches Olive in an intriguing position, is curious and invites her to tea. The invitation adds panic to Olive's already crazy self, but after awhile there's nothing for her to do but embrace her surreal world, take a breath and go upstairs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409835</url></doc>
