<plot>Mr. Goldstein is 93 years old and almost blind. He lives in an old people's home, where the young nurse Vera cares for him. One day he receives a letter from Emmi. She was his first love - and he has not seen her for over 60 years. In the beginning Mr. Goldstein does not want to touch this memory. He tries to ignore the letter. But then Vera gets him to write back and gradually the grumpy old man starts to reveal parts of his personality that have been locked away for a very long time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?237315</url></doc>
