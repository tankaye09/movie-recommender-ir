<plot>One of the greatest comedy films ever taken; illustrative of a topical event and thoroughly up to date. It consists of a series of humorous catastrophes following each other in such rapid succession that at the finish of the subject the audience is left convulsed with laughter. Like the celebrated character of Mrs. Macstinger, in Dickens' "Dombey &amp; Son," the lady of the house is evidently in the throes of spring cleaning. Her husband wanders disconsolately from room to room, trying to find one spare corner, where he can write a letter in peace. His adventures with the domestics, painters, paper hangers, chimney sweep and other assistants in the art of housecleaning, while looking for a secluded spot, constitute the whole story. The subject is clear throughout, photographically perfect, and the humor is such, that we can safely predict it will be a winner wherever shown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511605</url></doc>
