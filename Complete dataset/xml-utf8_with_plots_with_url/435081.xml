<plot>The film follows Julia, a Russian Immigrant, and her 5 years old daughter, who live on the border between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, 4 km from Gaza city, in Kibbutz Nir-Am. Because of its close proximity to the border, Kibbutz Nir Am has the highest ratio of rocket hits per square kilometer, and the least time for advance warning - less than18 seconds from the time the" Red Dawn" siren is sounded. This is a intimate and surprising story of a mother and daughter, who raise each other in their barbed wired fenced Garden of Ede, In spite of Israeli helicopters soaring above their heads, and Palestinian rockets falling in their yard</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435081</url></doc>
