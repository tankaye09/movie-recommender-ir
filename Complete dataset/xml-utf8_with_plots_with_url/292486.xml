<plot>They say the great Hebrew ruler, King Solomon, fell in love with the Queen of Sheba when she traveled across countries to visit him. Alas, she had to return to her own kingdoms so it was a love that could not exist. So in her honor, he has hidden a treasure - a treasure that was far beyond anybody's wildest dreams - somewhere in the mines he used to own in Africa. Quatermain's brother went missing after he tried to find this lost legendary treasure. He was last seen somewhere beyond the great desert of a then unexplored mysterious Africa. Quatermain and his friends meet in England and decide to go on a quest to find his missing brother. On the way they'll meet a strange man that may help them out, a lost tribe and a very wicked witch that wants to find the treasure too - at any cost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292486</url></doc>
