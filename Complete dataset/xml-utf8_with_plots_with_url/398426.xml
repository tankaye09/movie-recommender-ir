<plot>No Neck Joe is a kid, maybe 10 years old, whose torso and head are one piece. Five vignettes document the travails and triumphs of having no neck. First, two punks give Joe a wrapped present; he opens the gift to discover a shirt and tie. The punks laugh. Next, when Joe visits the zoo, giraffes laugh at him. In a graveyard, Joe befuddles a vampire. In the wild West, Joe can't be hung. In the last episode, the punks are back: each in turn sneaks up behind Joe and taps him on the shoulder. By the time he turns his whole self around, the punk has disappeared.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398426</url></doc>
