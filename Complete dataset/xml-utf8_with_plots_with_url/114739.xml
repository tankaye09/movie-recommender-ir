<plot>Jeff Clemens leads a crew of young drug dealers who distribute small quantities of cocaine off the coast. They operate in a very business like manner selling solely to a close knit group of people that they feel they have control over. When one of their usual buyers backs out of a deal last minute, they are directed to an outsider in which to sell their shipment to. Jeff begins to lose his grasp of control when he finds difficulty intimidating his new contact. Never the less, the operation goes through as intended. After the deal is made and tensions start to ease up within the crew, their entire world is shattered when a terrible tragedy occurs causing them to question their actions and the direction their lives have taken.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114739</url></doc>
