<plot>Before their third bombing mission over Germany the crew of the Boomerang prayed under the wing of the aircraft. It was then that the pilot, Charles Arnett, knew he wasn't coming back. He went anyway. His son, Mark Arnett, spent 14 years making a documentary of how his dad was shot down over German, spent eleven months as prisoner of war, and returned home to marry the girl he had only met three times. But Mark could never seem finish the documentary. In March of 2008, Mark's father pasted away. He finished it in a week.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054564</url></doc>
