<plot>Life in a high paced city drains our individuality; Thailand's New Year festival has the answer. "Lets throw water at each other." This visual anthropology is a personal travel backwards to humanity from fast paced living. Desolation Angel takes us on a journey of discovery and acculturation as we travel from the megalopolis of Bangkok to provincial Thailand to unravel a new pathway in life. The catalyst is of this awakening is an ancient, complex culture and as we are lead through this experience Erich is given a re-birth as the complexities of the culture open up his heart to a necessary, often overlooked pleasure in life - simplicity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?142058</url></doc>
