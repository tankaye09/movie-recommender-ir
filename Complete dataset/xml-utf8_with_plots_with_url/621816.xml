<plot>Twelve girls stand in a row according to size. A magician displays an empty flour barrel to his audience. He then calls each girl to him, beginning at the eldest, and as she steps upon the platform, he lifts her up and places her in the barrel. He continues down along the line until they have all been placed in the barrel, which he overturns and shows the audience that there is nothing in it. This picture is an exceptionally fine illusion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621816</url></doc>
