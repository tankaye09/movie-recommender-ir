<plot>Vivid and exciting throughout. Shows great volcanic disaster, including the explosion of the crater, the falling of ashes and cinders upon the doomed city, the destruction of the buildings and lighthouse, and the sinking of the ships in the harbor. The imitations of the crater explosions are perfect, and pronounced by spectacular artists to a most perfect reproduction of the calamity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380491</url></doc>
