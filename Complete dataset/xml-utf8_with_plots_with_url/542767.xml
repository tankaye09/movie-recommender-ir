<plot>Handsome Jack Hampton can't be kept down on the farm after he sees the bright lights of Kenosha. So, Jack comes to the city to make his fortune as a salesman, purveying books, brooms, and eventually oil leases (and the latter, unbeknownst to Jack, is a fraud). One day, Jack spots an intoxicated masher bothering young Betty Parker on a city street, and he intervenes. Very soon Jack and Betty are an item. But Betty's snobbish mother wants her daughter to instead pursue a local wealthy-but-dull millionaire (though her tolerant father, Amos Parker, sides with his daughter). Betty brushes the boring suitor off onto a chum, Ruth, with conspiratorial help from another friend. Meanwhile, Jack's door-to-door sales efforts aren't always lucrative; in one scene, a broom-wielding housewife takes exception to his book-selling. Coincidentally, a bank robbery takes place downtown, and Jack joins the police chief and four detectives in the chase against the two desperate gunmen, who elude the posse by boarding a train across the state line.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542767</url></doc>
