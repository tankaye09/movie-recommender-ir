<plot>Clara is going nowhere as an unappreciated nurse's aide in an elderly home. The only bright spot in her day is her friendship with Davey, a feisty elderly woman trapped in an environment she despises and a body that is failing her. When an incident at the home's pool reveals a paralyzing fear that Clara had kept hidden, it is Davey who nurses Clara through her inhibitions. Together these women overcome the obstacles preventing them from determining their own lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649846</url></doc>
