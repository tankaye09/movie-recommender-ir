<plot>Our main character sets about getting the right crew for what seems to be an armed robbery. But as we are taken along for the ride we realise that it's not what it seems. The "ultimate" job is in the shoot. The film shoot. What could the ultimate shoot be? From start to finish - all one shot! Take the camera from one angle to the next, seamlessly, with no special effects or cuts. The question is: can they pull it off?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494076</url></doc>
