<plot>Laxmi lives with her widowed dad, Pandit Deodhar Sharma, who is a much respected Advocate, and a brother, Subhash. Deodhar is very disappointed with Subhash as he not only neglects to attend college regularly, but has fallen into bad company, gambles, visits a Courtesan by the name of Kaminibai, and of late has also taken to alcohol. Deodhar would like Subhash to give up the bad company, especially that of Ranga Tripathi, but Subhash continues on with his lifestyle and eventually his father refuses to speak with him. Then when Deodhar is unable to get a not guilty verdict for one of his clients, he quits his practice. When Laxmi gets married to Avinash, Deodhar gives her a Mohanmala, an expensive diamond necklace, which Subhash pawns it with a money-lender and promises to return it soon. Even when Laxmi gives him money, Subhash does not return the money, resulting in Avinash asking his wife to find the necklace and then return to his home. When he learns of his sister's predicament, Subhash asks Ranga for help and the response that he gets from Ranga will change his life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366354</url></doc>
