<plot>Hal Roach, who no longer owned the rights to his "Our Gang" (aka The Little Rascals") creation, decided to "create" a similar gang of kids, to be known as "Curley and his Gang", and star them in feature-length films shot in Cinecolor. This film is the first effort, and is virually a remake, with longer running time, of the 1930 "Our Gang" short, "Teacher's Pet." The kids are fretting because their favorite teacher has gotten married and departed town, and they fear her replacement will be not to their liking. When Curley (Larry Olsen) mistakes the aunt (Kathleen Howard)of the new replacement (Frances Rafferty) as being the new teacher, he and the rest of the kids make plans to discourage her staying. Mortification sets in when the new teacher turns out to be sweet, young and pretty. Jackie Cooper and June Marlowe had the smitten kid/teacher roles in the original. Robert F. McGowan, who directed and wrote the original short, gets story credit here, and was also the Associate Producer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121869</url></doc>
