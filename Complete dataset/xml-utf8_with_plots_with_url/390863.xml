<plot>A young lawyer resents the demands of her bourgeois mother whose expectations of her appearance, as well as the men she chooses to date, do not match her values and priorities. Constantly at odds with her mother but not wanting to create waves, she only toys with the possibility of "doing her own thing." When she meets a new neighbor, a handsome artist who encourages her to be true to herself, she knows he will never meet with the approval of her opinionated and critical mother. Or will he?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390863</url></doc>
