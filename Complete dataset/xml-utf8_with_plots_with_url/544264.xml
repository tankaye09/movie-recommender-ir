<plot>Alex is not your typical sixteen year old high school girl. Peer pressure, parties, and shopping are taking a back seat to a childhood past that won't let her go. After witnessing the murder of her mother, Alex is forced into a state of muteness. Her older sister Kelli tries to protect and support her younger sister on the day she meets their mother's killer. Her best friend Benny is a constant comfort compared to the kids at school and faculty that don't make life easy for Alex. She must go through extreme circumstances to release the anguish inside her and move on. Alex conquers the hardest day of her life, which gives her hope and freedom that will finally bring her peace.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544264</url></doc>
