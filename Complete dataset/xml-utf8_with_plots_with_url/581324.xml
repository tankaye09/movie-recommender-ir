<plot>The Paper takes an in-depth look at the pressures and problems of modern journalism as faced by the staff of a university newspaper embroiled in controversy. Following a year in the life of Pennsylvania State University's, The Daily Collegian, the film features first-time journalists struggling with the greatest challenges to the field: plummeting circulation, barriers to investigative reporting, and criticism of coverage. The Paper is by turns inspiring and astonishing in its exploration of tomorrow's journalists wrestling with today's national media questions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581324</url></doc>
