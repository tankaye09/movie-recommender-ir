<plot>Action drama serial involving two teenage gymnasts, a boy and a girl (the girl was played by Barbara Slater, an Olympic-standard gymnast in real life). The elder brother of the boy was being blackmailed by a gang of crooks because his fingerprints were on a gun that had been used in a robbery though he himself had nothing to do with it. As well as training for a big competition, the two gymnasts endeavoured to help the brother and they successfully got hold of the gun and tracked down the baddie (played by Geoffrey Bayldon) in the sports hall just before the contest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417948</url></doc>
