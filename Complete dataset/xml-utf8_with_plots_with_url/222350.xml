<plot>Fresh out of prison, Dara is on a mission to scatter her mother's ashes in Lake Superior. She meets Noble, an endearing bundle of tragic flaws, and sparks fly between these two lost but likeable souls. Together they set off from Minneapolis to Duluth on what they think will be a redemptive and romantic road trip to the North Shore. They are abruptly sidetracked when Dara accidentally runs over someone on a lonely country road and wrongly takes the blame. The fatal accident was actually choreographed by Henrietta, a Kervorkian wannabe, and Dara and Noble become Henrietta's unwitting pawns. Against their better judgment, Dara and Noble agree to deliver the body to Duluth and hope that will be the end of it. But their troubles have just begun. Dealing with the aftermath of the 'accident' brings out the best and the worst in them. Twists of fate along the way test and strain their relationship even further. They persevere and in the end a startling surprise bubbles to the surface that changes everything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222350</url></doc>
