<plot>Jack Taylor is what most people would consider a successful writer; the trouble is that he has given up on his true dream. The same dream that, ten years ago, Jack and his three best friends brought to life. Against all odds, they somehow managed to produce their own independent film. On a cold, restless night, Jack makes his way down to his couch, turns on the TV and is faced, yet again, with the very object of his discontent. The campy horror film that he made 10 years prior! Their little movie, which was stolen from them for pennies and promises, is now a staple of late night cable TV. Jack watches as his ex-best friend, now A-list Hollywood star, Bart Pierce, spouts hackneyed dialogue while saving the world. Twenty-five hundred miles away, Harvey Bernstein, the most powerful man in Hollywood is also watching Jack's movie. The very next day Harvey summons his friend Bart Pierce into his office and demands a sequel. Once Bart stops laughing, he counters with the ludicrous caveat that he'll only do it with the original four guys. To Bart's surprise, Harvey agrees and the hilarity begins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529107</url></doc>
