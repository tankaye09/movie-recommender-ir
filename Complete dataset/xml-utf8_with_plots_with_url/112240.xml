<plot>From 1995 to 2047, the world has suffered through continues conflict as the G7 Nations' Global Defense Initiative (GDI) fights the shadowy, religious order of the Brotherhood of Nod (NOD) over one precious, yet poisonous, substance which is spreading across the world, adapting the planet to its alien environment as it goes, Tiberium. Nod's leader, known only as Kane, has for years shaped the world's future to cover the world completely in Tiberium and introduce mankind into the step of human evolution. Kane, marked by the Brotherhood as "The Messiah", lead Nod into two Tiberium wars against GDI and twice did GDI destroy Kane and brought Nod to it's knees, but not destroyed. After forty years of war the world is dived up into Tiberium, conflict, corruption and hope. GDI is at last beginning to fight back Tiberium but there are some things lurking in the darkness waiting to come out. It is time for GDI to pick up it's weapons to fight again, for the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112240</url></doc>
