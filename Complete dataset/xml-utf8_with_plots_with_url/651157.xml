<plot>This documentary follows Rebecca Romijn and Steve Willis as they approach Wet Design, the creators of the Bellagio fountain, with their dream to choreograph a fountain show. Their idea is to create a show to music that "builds" - specifically Ennio Morricone's "Ecstasy of Gold" from "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly." Despite numerous attempts to contact WET Design, the creator of the fountain, they were unable to reach the firm's founder, Mark Fuller, until Romijn made an on-air plea on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. WET Design engineer Peter Kopik translated Romijn's ideas to a computer system that emulates the fountain, "Virtual WET," and finally to the fountain itself. The final tests at Bellagio proved so successful that the piece was added to the fountain's regular show schedule.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651157</url></doc>
