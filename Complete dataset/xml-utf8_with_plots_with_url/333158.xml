<plot>As dusk approaches and workers stream out of the city, thousands of individuals are about to begin their day's work. They shuffle through subterranean car parks, sprawling shopping centers and soaring office towers, leaving behind a trail of gleaming floors and emptied waste paper baskets. They are the cleaners - an invisible and underpaid army whose necessary work goes unnoticed. In LESSONS FROM THE NIGHT we spend a night with Maia, who reflects on life, work and toilet bowls as we follow her nightly cleaning round through silent, empty spaces. As she works, she reveals some of the secrets of the city - the traces of human presence that we leave behind each day - and of her former life in Bulgaria. LESSONS FROM THE NIGHT is both homage to the menial worker, and an existential film about cleaning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333158</url></doc>
