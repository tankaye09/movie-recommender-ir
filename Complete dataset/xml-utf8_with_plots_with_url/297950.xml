<plot>On the night of November 9, 1938, Hitler ordered a progrom against Jews in Austria. Hand grenades destroyed all of Vienna's 42 synagogues and prayer houses, 6500 Jews were taken into custody and more than half of them were sent to the Dachau concentration camp. Members of the SA, Hitler's "Sturm Abteilung," ordered the Jewish residents of nearly 2,000 homes at gunpoint to leave, allowing them only one suitcase to carry with them. Jewish storefronts were smashed, the shattered glass piling up on the pavement. The documentary "KRISTALLNACHT REMEMBERED" by Evie Sullivan captures the memories of three Viennese Jews, Annie Wagner Lampl, Frederic Morton, and Egon Schwarz, in personal interviews. They were children and young adults when they were forced to leave Vienna after Kristallnacht. They later established productive, happy lives in the USA. This film project may be the last chance to get the facts of this horrible event from actual survivors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?297950</url></doc>
