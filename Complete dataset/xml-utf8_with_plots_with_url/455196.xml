<plot>Engrossed with keeping her figure and looking young, Suchitra Singh, has little time for anything else. She has seen her daughter, Indu, get married to Ajay Malhotra, against her wishes, give birth to two daughters, Pooja and Kajal, then get separated from Ajay, with Kajal staying with Indu. Suchitra and Indu now run a business and are quite successful with it's performance. Although they sign new contracts and earn even more revenue, they refuse to increase wages and benefits of their employees, which leads to a strike. Then their board of directors oust them and elect a new Chairman - who is none other than Ajay Malhotra. Pooja, who lives with her dad, confides that she loves a fellow collegian by the name of Yogi Joshi, and Ajay arranges her marriage with him, only to find out that he loves his other daughter, Kajal. Now Ajay has to decide whether he can go ahead and get Pooja married and break Kajal's heart or vice versa - complicated all the more by his estranged wife, and her family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?455196</url></doc>
