<plot>The Right and the Wrong is an "anti-colonial" movie. It is about a cruel white plantation owner who kills and ill-treats the Indian and Afro-Caribbean workers who slave for him in his island. Revolted by his brutality, two community leaders, one an Indian and the other an Afro-Caribbean, try to unionize their fellow workers. One daughter of the plantation owner is attracted to the black union organizer and has an affair with him. The climax of the movie comes near the end when the plantation owner "arrests" the 2 organizers and sentences them to death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586925</url></doc>
