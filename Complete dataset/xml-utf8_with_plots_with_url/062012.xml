<plot>"Another amusing and interesting film is the hurdle-jumping bear. These three subjects [with The Wrestling Bear and The Trick Bear] are bound to make a hit, as they are entirely new and the subjects are lively and interesting. There is not a slow or poor movement in any of them, and they will win applause every time."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062012</url></doc>
