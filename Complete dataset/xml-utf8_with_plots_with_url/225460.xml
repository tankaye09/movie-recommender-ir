<plot>Alan Weisner, an over stressed, dissatisfied television sit-com producer, takes a friend's offer of a trip to the country. He and his fiancee, Dian Meyerhoff, soon find themselves caught up in a small town world of corruption. As mixed up of a person as he is, Alan is easily seduced by the local Sherrif Hank's woman, Glory. Glory, also a tragically sad person, seeks the pleasures of other men to satisfy some undefined need. Hank, fully aware of this, can no longer control his jealous rage, and when he finds Glory dead, he sets out to play a game of cat and mouse with Alan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225460</url></doc>
