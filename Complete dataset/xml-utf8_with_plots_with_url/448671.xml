<plot>Jack, Bobby and Alex are on a dirt-biking vacation in the remote canyons of the Mojave south of Palm Springs, unaware that this part of the desert is the main route for illegal immigrants who are making a desperate run to the U.S. Riding alone out in this endless maze of canyons, miles from civilization, the three city boys stumble across the body of an illegal immigrant who has been shot to death. They soon encounter the killers: a couple of locals who have made a game out of hunting the desert-weary illegals. They quickly end up captured and imprisoned by these human predators and find themselves in a life-and-death struggle. Can their will to survive keep them alive long enough to escape purgatory?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?448671</url></doc>
