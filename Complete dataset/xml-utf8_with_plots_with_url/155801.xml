<plot>New York City, August 2004. Thomas (Robert Oppel) has lived on the Lower East Side his entire life. But as gentrification filters in and the rents begin to rise, he finds that he is unable to afford his apartment any longer. Offered a promotion at a job that would rankle his political sensibilities, he is forced to choose between taking the job and pleasing his girlfriend by being able to stay nearby, or refusing it, and allowing the relationship to greatly suffer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?155801</url></doc>
