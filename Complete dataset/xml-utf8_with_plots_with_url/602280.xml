<plot>A documentary about life of an artist , told through a portrait of an 84 year old world renowned dancer Vija Vetra. Vija Vetra is the portrait of a great spirit, full of symbols; a life story, that every artist in the modern world is able to relate to. Her devotion to the art of dance is her celebration of life, but it is also a life that is often lonely and full of sacrifice. Her creative , positive spirit stands alone against a materialistic world that is constantly changing. Her wise soul, her point of view on life, and criticism towards the modern world push us to think about secret meanings, symbols and the simplicity of life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602280</url></doc>
