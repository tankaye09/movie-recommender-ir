<plot>At age six, Jason Gaes became ill with Burkitt's lymphoma, a form of cancer so fast-developing that a tumor in his abdomen grew from the size of a golf ball to the size of a grapefruit in the time it took to drive across Minnesota to the Mayo Clinic. He talks about the two-year series of chemotherapy and radiation treatments and surgery which led to his recovery, and about the book he wrote - illustrated by his older brother Adam and his twin brother Tim - in which he tried to help other children with cancer deal with their fears and other difficulties related to their illness, particularly emphasizing that they could survive. Jason's family, including his parents Craig and Geralyn, also talk about how they dealt with the crisis.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666367</url></doc>
