<plot>CBI Inspector Kumar arrives home late one night, and watches in shock as his wife, Ashoo, being very intimate with another male. Enraged, he takes out his revolver and aims to shoot and kill both of them, but does not do so. Instead he fires a warning shot, and asks both of them to leave immediately. He does not permit Ashoo to take their only son, Prakash, with her. Kumar spends all the rest of his free time bringing up Prakash, and hating his wife. Years later, Prakash has grown up, and is now employed with a business firm, whose owner is Mohan. Prakash meets with Mohan's beautiful sister, Kiran, and falls in love with her. Kiran too is attracted to Prakash. What Prakash does not know is that Mohan is a gangster, with many aliases, and he also does not know that Mohan is the same male his mother had been having an affair with when he was a child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?388188</url></doc>
