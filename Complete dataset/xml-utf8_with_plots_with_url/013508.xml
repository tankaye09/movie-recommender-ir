<plot>Arthur and Dustin are neighbors, both grad students living on their own. Arthur is a very shy and quiet guy, while Dustin on the other hand is much more active and outgoing. Both men live separate lives, rarely running into each other except every so often on their porch. Little do they know that they are experiencing very similar situations in love and relationships, but receiving different ends. Arthur has met a new girl, Alice, who heart still lies with a past boyfriend. Dustin has the opportunity to find love with an old friend, Natalie, but his heart is burdened by the memory of a past girlfriend. Arthur and Dustin, though knowing almost nothing about each others' lives, will slowly learn from each other that in love and relationships, there is never any certainty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013508</url></doc>
