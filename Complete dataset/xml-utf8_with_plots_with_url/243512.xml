<plot>Short film filled with cameo appearances by many of the top film stars of the time. The best scene is at the film premiere, apparently the premiere was a costume event and many of the stars are dressed in various costumes. The stars would stop and pose for the newsreel cameras and then Frankie Darro would go up to them and either ask for an autograph or tell the stars he is there to deliver a telegram. Apparently the stars didn't know they were being filmed for a short subject. This film has a sound track and you can hear many of the stars make remarks to Darro, oblivious to the fact that they were being filmed. Constance Cummings tells Darro "her hands are shaking she is so cold." Paulette Goddard says to Darro "you have makeup on." When Charlie Chaplin asks for the telegram, he is told by Darro that "the envelops is empty." Look for a young Jean Harlow on the arm of George Raft and Arline Judge. This film is part of the added features on the double feature DVD by Catcom Home Video of "At War With the Army" and "Love Laughs at Andy Hardy." The film is in the public domain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243512</url></doc>
