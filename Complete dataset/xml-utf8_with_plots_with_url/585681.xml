<plot>The Real Video Awashishak (Awashishak is Oji-Cree for kids) is a children's program. The show is currently only available in Canada on the Aboriginal People's Television Network. The show features a family of puppets who teach the viewers a specific topic each week. Other highlights of the show include learning Syllabics (Oji-Cree Alphabet) and making crafts. The Real Video Awashishak obviously takes pride in the fact that they aren't just entertaining children, but teaching them as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585681</url></doc>
