<plot>This series looks at the role of Dr. Marie Cassidy. Cassidy reflects on her cases, looking at the issues which impact on the rise of violent crime in Ireland. Focusing too on her response to the media interest which continues to surround her, Death Duties is a fascinating insight into one of our most public yet elusive figures. Dr. Marie Cassidy, the State Pathologist, is a figure of much public interest and she is rarely out of the spotlight. But few understand the nature of her position or the job which she does on a day to day basis. Death Duties gets closer to the woman and her profession.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133854</url></doc>
