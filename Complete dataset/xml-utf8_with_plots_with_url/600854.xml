<plot>Gabe Tillman has finally ventured out on his own after a satisfying time spent in college and is now faced with a somewhat less satisfying professional life as a young independent bachelor. His chronic negativity stands in the way of a potentially fulfilling social life and even his "lifestyle counselor" neighbor sees a problem and offers her help. Finally, someone from Gabe's past drops back into his life and he sees it as a possible positive influence that could help him find his old self; but it's not quite that simple it turns out. There's a little more to the "influence" than what he thought and it's even at the expense of the life that he's finally achieved.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600854</url></doc>
