<plot>Dion is about to graduate University, and is still living at home with his delusional and self-obsessed family. He is also gay, and in the closet. How can he tell his family who he really is when they are completely wrapped up in themselves? It takes a surprise visit from his Godparents and a young Priest from Greece to show him the answer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069495</url></doc>
