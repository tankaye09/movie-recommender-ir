<plot>In the year of 1996, the Soshiki organisation led by Adel, was crushed by the hands of Eiji, Kayin and Ellis. After the Soshiki's reign of terror, all was thought to end the one-on-one battles. It was all a legend, until now. Now, in the year 2006, Eiji learned of some sacred weapons that could bring him all the power in the world, therefore, corrupting Eiji with an Evil Aura. Eiji then started a team of genetically engineered beings to help him with his idea of becoming an ultimate god. It is up to Eiji's son, Subaru, Kayin's little sister Naru, hopelessly flirtatious Rook Castle, Angel Girl Puella (and who also happens to be the daughter of past Toshinden fighter, Ellis.), Wild boy Fen, Prince Lancelot, Wise seer Genma, Ninja woman Miyabi and great robot Bang Boo to set up their own individual teams to compete with each other, as well as stopping Eiji and his minions (Eos and Zero) from becoming gods as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?613788</url></doc>
