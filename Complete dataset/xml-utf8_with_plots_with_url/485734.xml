<plot>Two short segments about romances between older men and younger women. In the first, Natsuki meets Uehara, a young, stressed-out company man, while riding a train one day. Uehara soon becomes infatuated with her, and decides to skip his business meeting to spend a romantic afternoon in her arms. When he learns about Natsuki's past, however, he rejects her and storms off. Will he change his mind before she is gone forever? In the second segment, Saya, a high-school student who is constantly berated by her teachers, meets an author of romantic novels. He finds that Saya inspires him to continue his work, and so he asks her to stay with him while he writes. Though he rarely speaks to her and never touches her, Saya begins to fall in love with the writer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485734</url></doc>
