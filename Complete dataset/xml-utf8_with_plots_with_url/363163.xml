<plot>Control 100 ton 'Mechs while leading up to eight hired guns into the heat of battle in the quest for the all-mighty C-Bill in MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries, the latest standalone installment of the critically acclaimed MechWarrior action-simulator franchise. And this time around, honor doesn't even enter into the equation - it's all about the money. Get your fledgling mercenary company sponsored by some of most notable and notorious mercenary groups in BattleTech history and battle your way through the Inner Sphere in more than 40 new missions as you doggedly pursue more lucrative C-Bill payoffs. With more than 35 'Mechs, new weapons, and new electronic packages available for purchase, chances are you'll need every C-Bill you earn. In MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries, being a hero doesn't pay, being a mercenary does - very well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363163</url></doc>
