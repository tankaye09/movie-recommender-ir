<plot>"Something has happened in the old far house (prison?) but no people says what: there were sliding doors, strange words, slaughters and an alone man confined in to a cellar..." Director Ruffino and his troupe went into a haunted prison in Palermo, now not more existing. They inspected all the building to find a natural location: when they went to the third floor they discovered a destroyed and "forgotten" area, rich of wrecks and nearly walled up. They entered in and found three doors: the second was closed and they had to break it, and when they where inside they find a very strange room, with an upset bed (it seems somebody was nearly inside in!), a still full wash basin and other objects, such as the room was still lived in.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135866</url></doc>
