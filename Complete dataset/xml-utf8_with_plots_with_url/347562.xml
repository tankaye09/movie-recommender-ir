<plot>The Hotel Lunik is a refuge for a group of radical utopists. In the center of it all, are the Siblings Franz and Babette, who through their anti-capitalist guerrilla campaigns call into question the basis for a money-based society. On the other side Franz's cousin Toni, is setting up a nightclub on the ground floor of the hotel with an entrepreneurial spirit in diametric opposition to it's surroundings. Guests are to be lured with a high-class lounge act along with a quiz show developed by Franz's own father, Alfons. Toni and his loyal bartender Viktor have their hands full contending with the difficulties of an unmotivated workforce. Among Lunik's odd population are Tom, the bellman with a screw loose, Nora, the pretty cook peeling potatoes and dreaming of a world in show business, and Emilia, the chronically sick photographer who wants to spend her last weeks singing in the company of friends. The criminal campaigns of Franz and Babette, reveal themselves to the undercover agent Max, as he gets closer to Babette. The two are in love. The romantic entanglements further complicate themselves as Franz falls for the filmmaker, Josephine. She arrived to make a documentary about the Luniks, upon hearing about the cause of Franz and his Christian communist enclave. Beyond that, the love-hate relationship between Alfons and Emilia thickens, as does Tom's adoration for the fed-up Nora, who's being snatched up by Toni for his nightclub pursuits. When Franz and Babette hold up a supermarket, the ground falls out from beneath them, and results in a chain of events from which no one remains unharmed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?347562</url></doc>
