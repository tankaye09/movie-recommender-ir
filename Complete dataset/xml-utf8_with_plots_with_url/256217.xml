<plot>A parable about art, propriety, and politics. A hip beat poet, who looks a lot like a child, reads poetry at the Ad Hoc Cafe; he's a success and Mr. Hipster, a powerful promoter, gets Iddy Biddy Beat's career moving with TV appearances, where the poet is a sensation. However, his poetry scandalizes Dr. Proper and his uptight wife, who arrange for Beat's arrest and imprisonment. The poet, sentenced for 10 to 20 years, is housed in a cell with an unsavory character.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256217</url></doc>
