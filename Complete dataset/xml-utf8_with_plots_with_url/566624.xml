<plot>Gill, a disgruntled goldfish, hates the world. He has nothing better to do than swim around in his fishbowl all day as entertainment for his arch nemesis The Kid, who constantly annoys him and feeds him flaky crap food.  Gill needs a babe - and needs one badly - but foul-mouthed rants and raves don't get you any action when you're trapped in a lonely fishbowl. Finally, Gill decides to take drastic action. But he never expected what's coming to him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566624</url></doc>
