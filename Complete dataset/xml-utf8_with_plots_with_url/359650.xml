<plot>Teenager Marvin looks like a huge walking hairball. His dad is convinced Marvin's lazy, so he tells him to paint the living room (while acting very lazy himself). Marvin goes off to buy paint, giving everyone he meets a flower. Back home, the mayor's televised speech about treating the city like your house gives him an idea; as his father naps, he rounds up his friends, who agree to help. Dad awakes to find the living room painted in psychedelic patterns; he's even more shocked to discover that the outside of their entire block has been painted in similarly wild patterns. But when the mayor praises Marvin for his originality and ambition, dad comes around.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?359650</url></doc>
