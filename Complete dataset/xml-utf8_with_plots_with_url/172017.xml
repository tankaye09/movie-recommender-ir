<plot>Emma, while young, took a strange decision in order to become a mother. Nobody in her town knew about her plans, and nobody ever could reproach her actions. Now that her crippled husband has died, it is up to her son Julian to find out the truth behind his origin. He will have to make choices and find his own destiny. His town, its morals, luck, Father Agostino, her beloved Macaria and the ghost of his father will be watching him closely. It is time to discover if Julian -like his mother before him- will have the guts to follow his own path no matter what everyone thinks about him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?172017</url></doc>
