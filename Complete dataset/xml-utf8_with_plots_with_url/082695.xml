<plot>First is seen a wonderful bicycle motor apparatus dashing down one of the principal streets of the city. It is closely followed by a number of engines, hook and ladder and hose trucks. All sweep by the camera, in rapid succession. The scene now changes to the front of an engine house. The horses rush out to their places in the apparatus, the large doors are swung open and out they dash in a wild rush for the scene of disaster. Next is the scene of the fire. The engines take the positions and the life saving crew hurry with their nets to the rescue of the unfortunate inmates of the burning building, who are seen at the top windows. The nets are spread by the firemen and the people are seen to jump into them and to safety. This is a very exciting film scene and is sure to make a hit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082695</url></doc>
