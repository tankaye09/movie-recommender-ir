<plot>A bloodstained abandoned car belonging to Matthew Thomas has been found in an open field, his wife Jessica, the prime suspect of his murder and his mistress, however she has a perfect alibi. Two misfit police detectives, Carter and Hayes are assigned the investigation and soon reveal other likely suspects, although the evidence is pointing towards a murder, no bodies are found and each suspect has a motive, making the detectives job more difficult than they can deal with, as their own personal life is rope tided into the investigation and becomes too foggy to make conscience of the evidence, being blinded by the blood found in the car, allowing surrounding elements take control of the investigation and their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660516</url></doc>
