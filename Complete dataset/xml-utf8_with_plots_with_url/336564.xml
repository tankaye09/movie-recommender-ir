<plot>Their music was raw, aggressive, inspired. Their look, breathtaking. Their bank accounts and pants, bulging. But hardships and tragedies, much worse than any rock band has ever experienced plagued their numerous climbs to the top and eventually brought about their repeated plunges to the depths of, like, hell. Take a ride on Likehell's turbulent rock and roller-coaster and witness their never-ending ordeals. Featuring cameos by members of Velvet Revolver and Queens of the Stone Age among others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336564</url></doc>
