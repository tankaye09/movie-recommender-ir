<plot>Joey and Barney met while serving together in Vietnam. When they came home from the war, it was impossible to fit back into normal life. Family and friends quickly slipped away. Painting houses with another burned out vet, their lives are empty and monotonous until they meet an extremely attractive but troubled young woman, Nancy Redman . . . A NEW FINISH emerges as a taught, gritty and yet humorously offbeat look at fate, love and missed opportunities. The simple act of painting a house slowly turns into an encounter that forces everyone involved to reexamine their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013863</url></doc>
