<plot>Charlie is a bachelor, a successful accountant and the world's cheapest man. In Charlie's world, women fall in the liability column of life's balance sheet - a Dutch date is preferable to a French kiss. So when a bungled ransom payoff dumps Laura, a beautiful but very extravagant damsel-in-distress in Charlie's lap, his life suddenly becomes more complicated. When that damsel solicits his help in raising the ransom to rescue her kidnapped fianc√©e, Charlie's life takes turn for the worse. When the bank freezes her assets and Laura opens Charlie's wallet to pick up the tab - for everything - Charlie's life descends into chaos. How could things get any worse? Well, they could fall in love - turning both their worlds upside-down in a romantic comedy of Odd Couple proportions. Ultimately, what will our hero do - choose love, or another Early Bird dinner for one?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101134</url></doc>
