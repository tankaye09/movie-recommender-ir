<plot>At the heart of Montreal's St. Laurent Blvd., one of Canada's most renowned and culturally rich urban thoroughfares, lies Simcha's Grocery. A month after the death of owner Simcha Leibovich, a motley group of his customers return to the legendary institution to reminisce about the enigmatic entrepreneur and eat his last batch of famous homemade pickles. A tasty and irreverent documentary romp through one of the last old-style businesses on "The Main". Featuring klezmer/hip-hop wunderkind Josh "Socalled" Dolgin, the legendary, recently deceased Montreal sculptor Stanley Lewis, food critic Barry Lazar and many more devoted customers of Simcha's. Featured as one of the best documentaries of the 2007 Rendez vous du cinema qu√©becois by 24 Images Magazine. Featuring Simcha and his late wife Fanny Leibovich, Anne Avram (Simcha's niece), Josh "Socalled" Dolgin, Stanley Lewis, Barry Lazar, Sofya Raginsky, Dan Seligman, Miro Corrcea, Joao Marques and more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?440585</url></doc>
