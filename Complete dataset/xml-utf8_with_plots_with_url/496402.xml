<plot>Sara and Unax are two quite different people looking for the same thing: what lies beyond human common comprehension. But their ways of achieving the goal take them on a journey they would have never foreseen. Synopsis: The story is divided into two main sections that will eventually merge in its climax; both sections move forward in parallel, creating nodes and intersections between the characters: Unax, a successful businessman who finds out that what he has been struggling for his whole life means nothing if faced to the main questions of existence; and Sara, a brilliant filmmaker in the spotlight of the new audiovisuals who must choose between following orders in order to make money or being faithful to herself. The stories of Unax and Sara develop in the opposite way: as Unax gains conscience of a higher level of existence and becomes more and more committed to it, Sara loses ground and starts falling and tumbling, unable to keep direction. Both of them walk the path described in the book "The Seven Valleys", by Bahá'u'lláh, but in opposite directions. They are not faced to the last stage of their journey until the climax of the film, when they finally meet and see the alikeness of their quests. That first and last meeting will turn things upside down, revealing the true nature of both characters and giving them the choice of finishing what they started or going back to their previous lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496402</url></doc>
