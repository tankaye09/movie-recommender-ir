<plot>Loss is a film eulogy for six firefighters who died in the collapse of the World Trade Center, Sept 11 2001. Engine and Ladder Company members talk about the day of the attack, how those events have affected their lives and most importantly pay tribute to their fallen fellow firefighters. The film was shot on location at various firehouses in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. All the firefighters who participated in the film were friends and collegues of the six firemen who lost their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343445</url></doc>
