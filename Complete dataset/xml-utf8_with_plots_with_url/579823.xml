<plot>Ahmed, an Iraqi doctor, runs a makeshift clinic with his father, Jasim, out of their own home in bombed out Baghdad. The victims of war pour in, suffering everything from diphtheria to gunshot wounds. Ahmed's father does not charge for his services, knowing that his patients cannot afford treatment anyways. When supplies start to run low, however, Ahmed begins to question his father's incurable idealism. Oman, a dear friend of Ahmed, is hit by a roadside bomb and the clinic barely has the requisite medicine to keep him alive. Ahmed confronts his father about the worsening situation and when Jasim refuses to charge patients money, he resolves to take action himself. Both men's lives are changed forever when a wounded journalist is dragged into their clinic while they are already operating on a compatriot. The clock is ticking and Ahmed must weigh the lives of his countrymen against this journalist- a foreigner, but willing to pay. Can Ahmed sacrifice one of his own in the hope of saving hundreds more?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579823</url></doc>
