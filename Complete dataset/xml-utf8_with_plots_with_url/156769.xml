<plot>The Roadside Motel is Dorothy's whole world. It is both her haven and her prison, a whiskey-yellow fantasy where nothing changes and everything is familiar. Her job as a cleaner allows her unlimited assess to the lives of the guests. She steals pieces of the outside world from them, creating a window of escape out of the broken, used and discarded objects that get left behind. A flash of red, a pair of wonderful stilettos, has the power to change everything. Marie has come to the Roadside motel. Dorothy is a story about two women struggling to between different stages of their lives. It is a quiet film, visually sensual, that explores the hard edge of fantasy and womanhood and the inevitability of change.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156769</url></doc>
