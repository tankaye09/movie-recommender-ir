<plot>Deborah, a third grade teacher, has a surprise visit from her best friend at the end of the school day. Although Deborah has expressed on numerous occasions to her meddling friend that 'You can't force people to like each other', her friend chooses to ignore the warning and corners Deborah into accepting a blind date to her St. Patrick's Day 'couples' party. Deborah remains optimistic until she meets her blind date, a colorblind vitamin salesman. Meanwhile, Deborah is captivated by David, a good-looking guy across the room who is being smothered by some blonde bombshell with a perfume bottle in hand . Although Deborah is unaware, David has been set up on a blind date as well and is less than thrilled about his date with a perfume model. Never fear, this is all part of 'the plan' and everyone is in on it. ( Except, of course, Deborah and David.) But, will it backfire? Does true love happen by accident? Or just one that appears to be?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074720</url></doc>
