<plot>"...by the year 2000 all the malls in the world are going to be connected. There will be a sub-culture of mall people born and bred, raised in the malls who have never seen daylight. They will be sent out with their American Express to the wafting sounds of Debbie Gibson." -Bill Hicks (1961-1994) Baraka meets McDonald's meets Giorgio Moroder. Galleria is a visual documentary that is as sad and telling as it is tongue and cheek and awkward. A slice of life portrait that candidly captures the mundane, depressing, and daily system of Canadian shopping malls driven by an electro-pop synth score by Woodhands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208976</url></doc>
