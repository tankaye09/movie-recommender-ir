<plot>Ricardo Beldini is hopelessly lost in London and becomes the victim of a mugging. He is taken into the home of Angola Niger, an elderly woman, who ministers to him by offering him a cup of tea. Eventually, he slips off into unconsciousness. When he awakes, he finds himself lying in a strange bed. He borders on the edge of consciousness, and his feet are terribly sore. The sound of bubbling water slaps against his face. He ponders for a while, taking in this strange environment. He painfully tries to get out of bed, but freezes in alarm as he sees his trainers by the wall with his feet still in them cut off just above the ankles. Angola marches towards him with a chopping knife ready to serve him up for dinner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260880</url></doc>
