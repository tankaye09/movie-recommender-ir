<plot>Desire, is a town nature has gifted with unusual blessings: healing spring waters. Its moral and economic owner is Dalmiro Bernal. He and Mercedes, his wife, run a Spa and hotel which, at the beginning of the story is about to celebrate its twentieth anniversary. 25 years ago, Mercedes got pregnant by Flauta, the town artist, bohemian and intellectual. Mercedes, being only 18, decided not to tell him about the baby, and went away to terminate the pregnancy and in everybody's eyes, she was going to the city to study. After careful thinking, she decided to have the baby and then give it up. Her parents, seeing she was very committed to her pregnancy, and foreseeing she wouldn't want to give it up, decided to deceive her telling her that the baby had been stillborn. The truth is that her baby girl, was born healthy and will be the protagonist of this story. Carmen, the name was given to her by her foster parents, is a girl with changing interests; considering her genetic heritage, she is closer to Flauta, her father, than to Mercedes, who studied medicine. Love of something or somebody is the main theme in our story, the characters move driven by old and new passions, and that's how Carmen arrives in town, believing a small amount of money will help her out of Argentina. Whereas Javier, one of the men who will change his life forever, arrives at Desire with the pressing need of getting a job done and leaving as soon as possible. But thanks to Dalmiro, he will become the leading man in the town's radio, something he longed for during his whole life, and that will give him the strongest support to take up again his old profession in front of a mike. The apparent tranquility of Desire is altered by these strangers who, related to Flauta, will form a block against Dalmiro and his power, and this will confront mother and daughter even further. The characters from Desire would rather not walk along the swamp zone. The try to avoid looking back, but the muddy waters will try to gain the space of the healing and transparent waters of the Bernals' Spa. And that means that the past, and all its deaths will prevail over the present filled with mystery and lies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168653</url></doc>
