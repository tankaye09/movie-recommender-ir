<plot>Nothing in the world is simply black and white. Three men sit in the Dog &amp; Duck, a pub in London's Soho. It's last call. One offers to get a round, and each wants a Guinness. He summarizes, "So that's three Guinnesses," and that precipitates a disagreement about the stout's plural: Guinnesses, Guinni (accent on the second syllable), or, simply, Guinness (as in one fish, two fish). Each form has its proponent. Will the lads take a break from their disagreement long enough for one to get to the bar and place the order? Will fisticuffs erupt?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072496</url></doc>
