<plot>The story of a hippo in the jungle, self-conscious about his rather round physique, with a desire to mold himself into a lean, muscle-bound mammal. However, as much as he may yearn to get fit, his fridge constantly beckons for him to snack on the tempting contents within. Will our hero succumb to the fattening goodies that taunt him, or will he be able to overcome his cravings and conquer his weight problem at last?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281720</url></doc>
