<plot>A pretty pickpocket is travelling on an express train from Osaka to her home village. She is an orphan, but wants to show off her wealth to the villagers who accused her father of being a spy. Detective Kita, who is on holiday, recognizes her and suggests to a pulp writer that he use her as a model for a story. While in a tunnel, she picks the wrong wallet from the man beside her, and subsequently loses her savings to an older woman pickpocket. At an inn, the writer replaces her money. The writer knows that the detective is falling in love with her, and the two follow her to her village. They find that the village is now part of a US air base and bombing range.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047715</url></doc>
