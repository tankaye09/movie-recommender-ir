<plot>A man in a bloody shirt enters his apartment. He's Vesser. His phone rings; his friend Sam invites him to join them for dinner the next night to meet a woman newly hired at a local museum. Vesser accepts and at a restaurant the four enjoy conversation. She's Angela, the museum's new night cataloger; she describes a new artifact, an English head crusher. Vesser perks up. Dinner goes well even though Sam tries too hard to push Vesser and Angela together. Vesser offers to walk her home. They stop in an alley and kiss; she asks him what he's wearing around his neck. With some reluctance, he shows her. From there, it's a startling turn. Until that moment, have they been blind?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074605</url></doc>
