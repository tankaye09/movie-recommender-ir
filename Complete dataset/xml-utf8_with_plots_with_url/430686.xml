<plot>Petro while on a journey, becomes footsore and weary, and lies down on a rock to sleep. The rock is immediately transformed into a bathtub, and he is drenched with water from the rocks above. Clambering out of the tub, the rock again appears, and while Petro stands in bewilderment, and shivers as though with the ague, the scene is transformed into a churchyard. Ghosts appear from behind the tombstones, and a heavy snow suddenly falls, covering the ground completely. Numerous other magical effects are seen throughout this entire picture, making it most marvelous. We can recommend this as a feature film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430686</url></doc>
