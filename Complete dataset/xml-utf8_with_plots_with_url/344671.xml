<plot>Vir is a bachelor from a small town working as a sous-chef in a five-star hotel in Mumbai. A handsome, charming, macho idiot who flirts with, yearns for and lusts after any woman who is friendly but seems unattainable. From his man-hating maid, whom he ogles as she wipes his floor, to the man-eating call center owner who could wipe the floor with him...from the too-tall model to the too-young pretty pest down the corridor...from the Bengali-Beauty-with-Brains-and-Books to the born-flirt next door - Vir is suckered by them all. Ego, Confusion, Commitment...it's so difficult to stop flattering and lying - to himself! The sometimes smart and sometimes silly observations of his all-male gang of cooks at the hotel kitchen is of little help until... Vir, an especially overconfident (and thus entertaining) specimen of the male species, is forced to grow up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344671</url></doc>
