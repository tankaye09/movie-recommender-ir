<plot>The Pink Panther feeds peanuts to an elephant at a zoo, and the elephant follows him out of the zoo and into the surrounding city. When he tries to return the elephant from whence it came, he finds that the zoo is closed. So, the panther has little choice but to open his home to the displaced hulk of an animal, which proves rather difficult in that his home is an upstairs apartment with a strict, short, pointy-nosed manager. The elephant's weight causes fractures in the between-floor foundations, spills water from the panther's bathtub, water which drops through the fractured floor onto the little man's face, and finally, while sleeping on an upper bunk on the Pink Panther's bunk bed, crashes through the bunk, floors, and panther and man beneath. Of course, the little man evicts the Pink Panther and the elephant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433268</url></doc>
