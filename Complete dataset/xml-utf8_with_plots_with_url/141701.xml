<plot>Artists reveal in casual and candid conversation, the importance of music, their favorite musicians and personal experiences directly related to the music they listened to - (ex: first instrument they learned to play, first album purchased, song they lost their virginity to, song that changed their life, etc.). They are visited in their homes and studios as they play songs from their collection, ride in their cars to hear what tunes they choose to cruise with, and see what music they need by their side.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?141701</url></doc>
