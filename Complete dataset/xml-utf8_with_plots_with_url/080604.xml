<plot>In 2001 &amp; 2002 Jamie Brooks was setting the lower division on fire playing for Oxford United. Winning the majority of the players' awards, it is not long before Arsenal get in touch and offer him a trial. However, two days before the trial Jamie is rushed to hospital where he is placed on a respirator and unable to move apart from his eyes. It is three weeks before Jamie is able to move even his little finger. This film looks at his attempts to overcome and return to playing football.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080604</url></doc>
