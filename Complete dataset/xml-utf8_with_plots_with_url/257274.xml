<plot>Kailashnath is a wealthy widower, who lives in a palatial house with three grown sons, Randhir, Rajiv, Rishi, and a younger school-going son. He manages the business on his own, but would like his sons to also take an interest, in vain though, as all three have their own interest at heart (being a Bollywood actor, singing, and boxing) and no interest whatsoever in running a business or seeking employment. To add to this, Kailashnath must now contend with a new neighbor named Kaushalya, a widow, with three daughters (Komal, Kavita and Kanchan) and a rather plump maid-servant by the name of Guddi. It so happens that the daughters have similar interests as Kailashnath's sons. So the six match-up, romance, have fun, and would like to get married. Kailashnath refuses to permit his sons to get married until and unless they establish themselves and are able to stand on their respective feet. He, therefore, puts forth a proposal to marry Kaushalya - a marriage that will douse the romance of these three couples - and change their relation into those of brothers and sisters - but will it make them take any interest in employment and business?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?257274</url></doc>
