<plot>a name, a face, a word or a woman that suddenly and repeatedly emerges in 17-year-old Aida's mind. She tries to get rid of it, but it pops up again and tortures her. The image is that of a dark and remote and possibly not so bad character; she is a stranger who polishes her finger nail and dyes her hair in a blond hue, and leave Aida no peace of mind. But the woman's end is quite real and for the first time Aida consciously experiences doubt. She realizes that beauty and pain are two inseparable ingredients and finally Aida begins to focus on a hope which she has witnessed for one moment in her parents faces. Then she feels in herself the hope for a future whose nature she does not realize. She experiences a profound moment of comprehension and that seems to be sufficient.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151891</url></doc>
