<plot>A mosaic of fiction, documentary, literature, memoir, philosophy, animation, and European Cinema - EuroAmerican is a short meditation on perceiving and cultivating a rich human life. This short film is told in segments: an Englishman's observations of the American predicament, a French exercise in perception inspired by George Perec, a young American male's facination over women, two destined lovers isolated from one another by their Apartments, a Dziga Vertov-influenced City Symphony of Wichita, Kansas, and a final Kieslowskian composition which ties the whole together. The film seeks to prod its audience into questioning its own sense of perception. We perceive, but do we see? Has the American lifestyle led to a dullness of sense? As Americans, do we fail to explore the richness of a world at our fingertips, preferring to concentrate on a future utopia we are perpetually building?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183451</url></doc>
