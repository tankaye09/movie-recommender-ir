<plot>The upper deck of a large fishing smack is plainly in view and on which a number of fishermen are seen to sort the fish. Suddenly one of their number turns on the hose and they engage in a fight in order to obtain the hose, after which they sport with it until all are soaked through and through. Lots of animation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206745</url></doc>
