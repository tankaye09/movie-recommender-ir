<plot>Typical Soviet "industrial drama" (or "production drama"). The handsome hero is a young man out of college, assigned to his first important engineering job in far-off Sibirsk. The hero tries to cope with serious industrial problems (some caused by his own carelessness), and in one case his old crane operator is seriously injured in a crane accident. At the same time the hero faces a romantic dilemma. He is torn between two loves, his current fianc√©e and his old flame, who shows up unexpectedly, still hoping to win him back. Many problems, many conflicts, subjecting the hero to a "sleepless night." Will he manage to resolve all his dilemmas?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066213</url></doc>
