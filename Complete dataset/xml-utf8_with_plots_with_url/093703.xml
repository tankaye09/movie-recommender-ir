<plot>In the annals of televison, few children's programs ever made as much impact as Captain Kangaroo. Hosted by Bob Keeshan (at one time, he played Howdy Doody's friend, Clarabell) from the appropriately-named Captain's Place, the Captain was so named because he always wore an overcoat with large, kangaroo-like pouches. Each show featured stories, skits, vaudeville acts, songs, games and other educational activities. Captain Kangaroo's friends were Mr. Green Jeans (who always brought an animal to the show); Dennis, an apprentice handyman and do-it-all person; and Mr. Moose and Bunny Rabbit. Bunny was always mute, but made his point ever-so-cleverly, while Mr. Moose always tricked the Captain into allowing him to stand under a shower of pingpong balls. As the show got on in years, new features were added, including Uncle Backwards (a tape of some simple action, such as peeling an orange or building a doghouse, shown in reverse); "Picture Pages," a matching activity hosted by Bill Cosby; and Slim Goodbody, which taught children about health, nutrition and physical fitness. Many actors, actresses and singers guest starred. In the early 1980s, new formats were attempted, all without success including the early morning "Wake Up with the Captain" (which starred new puppet friends and employed the joke-of-the-day); by 1984, the show ended its 29-year CBS run. During the early 1990s, Bob Keeshan hosted a daily series airing on PBS; it featured clips from the classic program along with new footage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093703</url></doc>
