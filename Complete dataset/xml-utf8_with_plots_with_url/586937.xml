<plot>" The Right To Be Wrong" provides a glimpse of modern Israel through the stories of ordinary Israelis and Palestinians, Jewish and Arab, Muslim and Christian, all in search of peace. The story of David and Samir is about coexistence and friendship. It begins in David's car as he drives to Samir's restaurant in Ramla, a local Arab village. Over humus and falafel, Samir talks about his ties to Ramla stemming back to before 1948. His son, Jalil expresses his torn identity as an Israeli Palestinian Arab. Interwoven with David and Samir's stories, are even more compelling stories about everyday life in Israel. Finally, the passion for peace is exemplified in a journey to Kansas City with David, and Samir to assist the in hosting a "hafla" or party.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586937</url></doc>
