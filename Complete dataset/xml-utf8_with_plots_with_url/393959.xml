<plot>Presents a barroom, with all the accessories, including a barmaid, who serves a policeman with a glass of beer at the side entrance. Two men are smoking and having a quiet game of "draw," when a couple of "toughs" lounge in and a quarrel arises, in which the policeman takes a hand and forcibly expels the crowd. A very popular and realistic subject of this kind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393959</url></doc>
