He does well in his studies, re-locates to Bombay, where he hopes to live temporarily with one Ram Mohan. Unfortunately, Raju is unable to locate Ram, but the friendly slum dwellers take care of him, feed him, and house him. He meets and falls in love with Renu, and it is she who gets him a job at Chhabria Builders where she works as a Receptionist. Thereafter there is no stopping Raju, as he climbs the ladder of success, and soon not only becomes the Chief Engineer but also finds a place in the heart of the Senior Partner's daughter, Sapna Chhabria. Sapna starts to make plans about Raju's bright future, which comes at a heavy price, as he does makes compromises, some of them serious enough to bring down a bridge that was being built under his supervision, resulting in the death of 4 persons. Watch what happens when Lalkishan Chhabria, his partner Malhotra and Raju try to cover-up this negligence as an act of terrorism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454511</url></doc>
