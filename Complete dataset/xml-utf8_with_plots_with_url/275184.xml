<plot>In this tale of rural caste divisions, polygamy is added to the theme in this story of Uma (Devika Rani), born in an orthodox Brahmin family. To the despair of her parents she values her friendship with low-caste potters. Especially with Ranu (Sahu). When she marries Nandlal (Ali), a man from her own caste, her potter friends are happy for her - until they learn that Nandlal is taking a second wife, Padma, with Uma's consent. The problem is that Uma is thought to be infertile. Uma returns to her parents' home mainly because Nandlal is paying no attention to his new wife, and when she returns she meets Ramu again. Nandlal overhears a conversation between Ramu and Uma and, when Uma suddenly discovers that she is pregnant after all, he doubts her fidelity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275184</url></doc>
