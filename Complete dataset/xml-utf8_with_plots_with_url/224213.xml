<plot>Guatemala, 1996. We entered into a guerrilla camp to film the documentary "The Word of the Guerrilla". We witnessed how they took a police headquarters, we filmed their lives in the camp. We interviewed the guerrilla fighters in a critical moment in Guatemala's History. Several months later a Peace Agreement was signed. Today we've returned to Central America to look for this same people, to hear their voices again and to know what has happened to the lives of those guerrilla fighters along all those years. Where are the motivations and the ideals that made them take up arms. Where are their illusions and hopes of a better life. Lives before and after peace.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224213</url></doc>
