<plot>In the final, uneasy week of peace before the outbreak of the Second World War, a young Sheffield factory worker with a passion for climbing sets off for Snowdonia to make his mark on the mountain. Just when it seems that Jack has the world at his feet - and the girl of his dreams - his hopes are dashed, only hours before his world is swept away by war. The wild landscape of Welsh mountains forms the backdrop for this redemptive tale, as Jack Harding struggles to escape his rigid background and the fearful expectations of the inevitable slaughter ahead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?098082</url></doc>
