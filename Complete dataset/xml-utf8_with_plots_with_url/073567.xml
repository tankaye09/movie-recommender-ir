<plot>In World War Two black American soldiers traveled to the Pacific and Australia where their experiences ranged from unforgettable love affairs with white women to being summarily shot by their own white MP's. Despite being allied with Australia, black Americans were initially turned away from her shores due to the racist white Australia policy in place at the time. But the war in the pacific intensified and black soldiers eventually came to Australia where the treatment they experienced surprised them. Sixty years later they remember their experiences of serving in a segregated army on Australian soil.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073567</url></doc>
