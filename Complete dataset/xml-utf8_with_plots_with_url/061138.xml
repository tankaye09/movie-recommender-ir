<plot>Something different in this edition of WB's long, long series of "Sports Parade" shorts (production number 3503)in that leading athletes from a number of fields use their own special equipment and skills in a golf match against an outstanding amatuer golfer, Johnny Dawson. Howard Hill uses his bow-and-arrow, Dick Miller his rod-and-reel and Charlie Stevens a sling-shot. Lou Novikoff shows up with his baseball bat, which should have disqualified him for bringing a club to a club-game. Whatever, it beats the ones featuring water skiers at Cypress Gardens. Put this one, along with two thousand more sports shorts,in the Sports Genre...that doesn't appear to exist. O.K., but it ain't no (excuse my Texas grammar) documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061138</url></doc>
