<plot>Herbert is a disgruntled office worker who is having a particularly bad day. His co-workers are annoying him and his whole life seems to be caving in. Everything revolves around money. Then a curious animated creature, King Kommercial, who takes him on an enchanted musical journey through a TV set, that becomes an animated world, approaches him. During this musical grusical adventure, Herbert realizes what his problem is, it is not the co-workers or his life, and it is he. He is the one causing himself the aggravation. Upon realizing that the world is in fact corrupt and he can do nothing about it, Herbert decides to change himself and becomes more assertive, taking on his co-workers and his universe. But is that the best thing that could happen?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350520</url></doc>
