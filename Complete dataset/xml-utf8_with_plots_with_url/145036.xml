<plot>Dickey Betts &amp; The Great Southern Band performed live at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall Of Fame and Museum September 28, 2004. Betts, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 as a member of the Allman Brothers Band, is the first inductee to record a new release live at the Museum. Dickey Betts joined the Allman Brothers Band as second lead guitarist and singer in the late 1960s. In addition to matching bandleader Duane Allman lick for lick, Betts also wrote such memorable songs as "Revival" and the instrumental hit "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed." After Duane Allman was killed in a road accident in 1971, Betts and Allman's brother Gregg shared leadership of the band, with Betts writing and singing the group's biggest hit, "Ramblin' Man." Betts released his first solo album Highway Call, in 1974. The Allmans split up in 1976, and Betts formed Dickey Betts &amp; Great Southern. The Allmans reformed in 1978, with Betts contributing "Crazy Love", "Angeline" and "Straight From the Heart." Betts returned with the Dickey Betts Band (becoming Dickey Betts &amp; Great Southern in 2002) and Pattern Disruptive in 1988. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum exists to educate its visitors, fans and scholars from around the world about the history and significance of rock and roll music. The Museum carries out this mission through its efforts to collect, preserve, exhibit and interpret this art form.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?145036</url></doc>
