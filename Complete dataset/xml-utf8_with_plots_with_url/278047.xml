<plot>This narrative short is based on a number of true stories. Joe was my grandfather. Charlie was his right knee and our imaginary trail horse until Joe died of Lou Gerhig's disease in 1976. The voices of Kip and Syl stitch together the 6 chapters of this dreamy reflection. A journey back to the house on Quapaw, discovered in severe disrepair, presents a physical representation of the decline of a household. Searching for a sense of personal history, reason, and some sort of closure, Kip and Syl confront their personal ghosts. This is a story of cowboys, of lost dreams, and of broken houses of memory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278047</url></doc>
