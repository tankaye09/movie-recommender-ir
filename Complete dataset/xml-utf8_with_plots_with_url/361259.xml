<plot>Two unsuspecting teenagers, Matt and Brian, are innocently tossing a Frisbee in the park when they find a door randomly standing in the middle of the grass. The boys argue about about the door's origin and purpose and ultimately decide the only way to find out what lies on the other side is to go through it. So they do. At first everything seems normal but suddenly Matt begins to slide across the grass as though on ice. The two soon realize they have entered a dimension of altered physics. They try to exit through the door that led to this strange place, but it is locked! After an unsuccessful attempt to break through the door, it vanishes, leaving the duo trapped in a world of stop-motion to find the key to their safe return. What ensues is an adventure that takes the boys from highways to back alleyways to long hallways, all the while trying to take advantage of the most unusual physics of this new world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361259</url></doc>
