<plot>Carhenge is a replica of Stonehenge made out of 38 junked automobiles. It is located in western Nebraska in the small town of Alliance. The film explores its creation, the battle to keep it from being torn down, and whether or not it is art. It portrays the colorful character of the creator, Jim Reinders, as well as several other interesting and unusual people. Carhenge has become fairly well known and attracts close to 80,000 visitors a year to this town of 9,000. It also has begun to show up on many films, TV commercials, album covers, music videos, and magazines. Scholars, historians, and artists give their views. It all comes together in a humorous and visually stunning documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?094359</url></doc>
