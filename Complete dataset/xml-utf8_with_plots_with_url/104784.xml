<plot>From a hedonistic collegiate whirlwind of posh parties, playboy fraternity president Christian Roane emerges only to inexplicably brood over some buried issue of discontent. By chance, a similarly misfit coed, Sarah Stein, wanders into into his sight at a party. Mysteriously, he is attracted to her despite the availability of many more welcoming targets. He follows her, and surprisingly, fails to seduce her. In the following days, on top of his broken mojo, Christian detaches himself more and more from the daily masochistic adventures of his best friend and fellow frat brother, Victor. Instead, he seeks out Sarah again on campus, and confides his dissatisfaction with his life. What begins as harmless yet calculated flirtation with the aloof young woman soon turns into an obsessive pursuit marked with surreal, strange glimpses into Christian's mind. Sarah, completely unaware of the degree of disturbance in her enamored new fan, once again rebuffs him in favor of another young man. Unrequited, Christian falls simultaneously into full stalking mode and dysfunctional depression. He appears to teeter on the brink of violent confrontation, and inevitably, the loss of his social status. Through it all, Victor tries to revive him, the frat brothers doubt him, and eerie questions arise as to the true nature of the unhinged hero and his fraternity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104784</url></doc>
