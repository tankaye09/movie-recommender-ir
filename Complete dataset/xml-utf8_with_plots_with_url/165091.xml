<plot>Jonah and his college friends are facing the real world. Unified by beer and uncertainty, Echoboom is an existential romp through private school life in the digital age. The last six months of college (starting with the 2004 Election Night) are played out through the prisms of young Democrats and Republicans, unrequited love, apathy, ignorance, the Internet, and general debauchery. Jonah battles his baby-boomer parents' wishes for him to become a lawyer as he tries to buy time to find some meaning, if only he could stay sober. Ultimately, Echoboom is a film about the next generation flooding the workforce, the heavy achievers destined to move back home with their parents. It takes friends to figure out life isn't a journey, it's a destination.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165091</url></doc>
