<plot>Dorian Westmore accepts an aspirin from a total stranger, Inez Palmer. She is distracted and fails to take it, but later gives it to her wealthy uncle who dies as the aspirin was poisoned. She is tried and convicted and her fiance, Peter Kane, tells her attorney, J. T. Vickers, that he is going to prove her innocence. Inez, reading about the trial and recognizing Dorian as the lady she gave to aspirin to, realizes that it was meant for her from the man she had been blackmailing, J. T. Vickers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317789</url></doc>
