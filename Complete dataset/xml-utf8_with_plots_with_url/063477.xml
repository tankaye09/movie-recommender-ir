<plot>Being part of the mob family means always belonging to that family. There is no way out. So, when Franco DeMaio (Zan Calabretta) gets out of jail and wants to break free, the family pulls him back in. Franco wants to live a peaceful life with his grandmother and have a new beginning, away from the mob life. However, Vittorio and Salvatore, members of Franco's old crew, want him to continue with his activities as if nothing had happened. Franco refuses and ignores Vittorio's demands and threats. Franco's life is turned upside down when on one unfortunate night he comes home and finds his grandmother a victim of a heart attack. Matters get worse when Franco finds out that she fell ill after being terrorized by Vittorio. Now, fury engulfs Franco, who goes after his old crew in a rage of revenge and he discovers that the truth will always prevail and that honor, loyalty and pride carry a lot of weight in the family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063477</url></doc>
