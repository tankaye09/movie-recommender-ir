<plot>This documentary showcases the "Floating World" theme of the 2002 Burning Man Festival capturing the energy, spirituality and passion of the annual event. It details many of the incredible art installations, the imagination and originality that went into their creation, and the artists who conceived them. Much like the festival itself, "Aqua Burn" would be nothing without the burners; the artists, performers, participants and volunteers who flock to Black Rock City each year to survive as community and push past their own physical and emotional barriers. Interviews with various burners reveal their personal connection to Burning Man, what the festival represents to them and what keeps them coming back, highlighting the surrealistic feast for the eyes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044128</url></doc>
