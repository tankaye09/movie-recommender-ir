<plot>Set and mainly shot on location in St Kilda of the late 1980s, this is a loving evocation of a time and environment that may have slipped away. Valma, verging on midlife, wants a baby with her partner Joe, who is a gentle, loving and well-meaning wannabe writer, but who has had absolutely no success in achieving self-sustainability, and is far from a good prospect as a reliable father. Even when he tries really hard, he finds himself in the job from hell ('a chicken factory? - is that where they make chickens?'). Alphonse is a 'businessman' who has 'a new business every year'. This year his main income comes from arranging 'marriages of convenience' ("when was marriage ever convenient??" - Alphonse) to help new immigrants fast-track to Australian residency and citizenship. Usually, Alphonse arranges 'marriages' between otherwise unmarriable immigrant women and gay Australian men - the latter because "there is no risk of funny business", and who are paid for their husbandry until the divorce, which is also arranged by Alphonse. However, on this occasion, to help Valma and Joe Alphonse breaks his own rule. He employs the very heterosexual Joe as a bridegroom of convenience. But here's the kicker: Joe's 'bride' turns out to be the young and gorgeous Fadya! To further complicate matters, the authorities decide to take an interest in Alphonse. Three Immigration officers each contribute their own personal version of hell to the Valma-Joe-Fadya triangle. This is a comedy, so of course it all works out in the end. Maybe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013036</url></doc>
