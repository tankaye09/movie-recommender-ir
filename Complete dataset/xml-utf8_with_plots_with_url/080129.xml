<plot>The life and adventures of Bosco, a small red-haired puppet who lives in his "bosca" (Irish-Gaelic for box). Bosco never leaves his box but discovers the world through song and stories contributed by the regular presenters and the daily trip through a "magic door". Bosco has a large number 5 displayed on his box, due to the fact that 5 is his favourite number. Bosco speaks in Irish some of the time, using words familiar to young Irish children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080129</url></doc>
