<plot>An Orwellian drama touching on the philosophical side of human existence, FADE presents a new understanding of the sci-fi genre. Chloe is an emotionless and obedient worker simply accepting her existence at face value. By happenstance, she encounters Anna, who inspires Chloe's exploration and eventual transcendence. Lifting primarily from the cultural theory of Louis Altheusser, this is an examination and provocation of meaning, of cultural human construction. Gentle in its tone, minimalist in its structure, but powerful in its message. Shot on a shoestring budget in a Minneapolis homeless shelter and an 80 acre nature preserve in Lanesboro, FADE drew in the art-house crowd of the Minnesota film scene, receiving a small theatrical run and a spot on MPR. It also received play in a graduate philosophy course at the University of Minnesota, Morris, alongside screenings of Resnais and Godard.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187525</url></doc>
