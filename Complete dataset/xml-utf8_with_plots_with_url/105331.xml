<plot>I saw this film when it came out in 1976, and I've always seen the wrong description on websites that sell this film. This film is about Fong Sai-yu going under cover as a servant in the villain's mansion. He is a famous fighter that fights for justice. While at the mansion he met the great Kow Lee played by Tao-Liang Tan also a great fighter that works there for the villain. He recognize Fong Sai-Yu right away and challenge him to a fight because he wanted to match his fighting skill with the famous fighter. At first Fong Sai-Yu declined but eventually agreed after the great Kow Lee threatens to reveal his identity. They met on top of a mountain where they fought to a draw and then became great friends. The great Kow Lee later help Fong Sai-Yu at the end of the film to defeat the villain who was very tough to beat. Fong Sai-Yu then delivered the best line of the film after The great Kow Lee died in helping him defeating the villain. " life has no meaning without friends".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?105331</url></doc>
