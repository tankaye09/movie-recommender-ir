<plot>Four grown wolves and a little one chase a sheep through the night. Little Wolf stops, captivated by the moon. He catches hold of it, and then the moon rises, with Little Wolf hanging on. The other wolves see him hanging there and try to rescue him, but their attempts are confounded by the playful sheep. As day breaks, the moon sets and Little Wolf comes close enough to earth to jump to terra firma. A celebration ensues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338615</url></doc>
