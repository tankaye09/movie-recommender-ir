<plot>Pharaoh's Revenge: Egypt's Lost Treasure tells the story of the mummy of Rameses I on its return, 150 years in the making, to Luxor in 2003. Rameses I, the founder of Egypt's 19th Dynasty, ruled from 1293 to 1291 B.C. But his mummy was spirited out of Egypt for display in a Canadian museum in the 1850s, courtesy of tomb robbers who sold it into exile. Now, with help from a museum in Atlanta, the Egyptian relic makes its way back home to a spot reserved specially for the mummy and unleashes tales of a pharaoh's travels.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431007</url></doc>
