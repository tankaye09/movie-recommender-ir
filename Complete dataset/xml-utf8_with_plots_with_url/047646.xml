<plot>Honest and dedicated Police Inspector Kumar Chandra Singh intercepts a bank robbery, and is in the process of arresting the bank robbers, when he himself becomes a suspect, and is apprehended with a suitcase containing some of the cash stolen from that bank. Kumar is stripped of his powers as a policeman; is arrested; tried in court; and sentenced to prison. As a result of his arrest, his mother dies of shock and disbelief. He is crippled in an accident, and must use the help of crutches to walk. When he is released from prison, he has only one goal in his life - to find the culprits responsible for his ruin, and humiliation. And for this he finds support in Kamini, Sonia, Sunita, and Shanker Dada, little knowing that one of these women was herself involved in getting his arrested.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047646</url></doc>
