<plot>John has captured the Captain. He proposes a boxing match: his chicken, the Honduras Hurricane, against the Captain's, which John will provide: a scrawny thing that's been kept in the fridge. The boys, spying through a window, see this and realize the Captain hasn't got a chance, and if he loses, John will take his house. Fortunately, there's a very feisty baby eagle nearby. The kids capture it and pull a switcheroo, and before long, the eagle has made short work of the Honduras Hurricane, forcing John to make good on his side of the bet and eat his boxing ring.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564879</url></doc>
