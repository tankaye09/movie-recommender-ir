<plot>Bobby's entire life has been centered on looking out for his heroine addicted brother, Chubs. It is time for him to break away and follow his girlfriend Beth Ann to Boston and to start living for himself. However Chubs, and their partner in crime Jack, convince Bobby to help them pull one last job to square away some debt. But much to their surprise, it turns out they crossed the one man you don't cross, the notorious second rate drug kingpin "Mickey". To make amends for their crime, Mickey holds Chubs hostage and forces Bobby and Jack to go on a killing spree. While on this downward spiraling circle of deceit and decadence, lines are drawn, morals soon vanquished, loyalties questioned, but love is never forgotten. Underneath the truth will lie, by the river rye.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088589</url></doc>
