<plot>"This urgent feeling... grandma is going to die. As if time were paused and all I have is this moment, to change her image of me, the way this relationship will have been engraved in memory." When Gil arrives at the hospital, she meets her grandmother, the myth, lying as a vegetable. This exchange in roles allows her to talk with her, as she never talked before. Is it possible to ask for forgiveness from an unconscious person? Perhaps acceptance can only come from within.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426659</url></doc>
