<plot>Perfect Lane is a cul-de-sac street in middle-America with three two-story houses. Two of the houses have perfectly trimmed grass lined with perfectly shaped shrubs and roses. The house in the middle is different. Perfect Lane is a comedy about the American middle-class obsession with material possession and consumption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429062</url></doc>
