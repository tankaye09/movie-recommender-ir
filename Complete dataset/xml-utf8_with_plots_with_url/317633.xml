<plot>One night in the lives of several waitresses at an upscale LA supper club. One is retiring after thirty years "in the business" and many of the younger women are jockeying/positioning themselves for the opportunity to take over her shifts once she is gone. In the course of the evening we see their individual strengths, weaknesses, foibles, and qualities. Annie Potts and Annette O'Toole play young girls just out for a good time. The job supports their fun times. They have no interest in the vacated position and can not understand the other women's rivalry over it. Elizabeth Wilson is the retiring woman's partner, both on the supper club's floor and in private life. She gets to choose which of the other waitresses becomes her new partner. Susan Tyrrell is a "hard as nails" worldwise professional waitress who sees this position as her ticket to better customers, better tips and a much easier existence. Ronee Blakley is quiet and keeps to herself, but she's teaching herself French, and recognizes that the men she is serving could be an avenue out and up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317633</url></doc>
