<plot>Their lives held such promise. Beautiful, young women on the verge of blossoming...then, suddenly, they were gone. A torn item of clothing, a cell phone, a smeared bloodstain... precious few clues are left behind. An investigation begins, police conclude the worst. Occasionally these chilling stories end well... the missing girl is found a live - or she escapes her captor and emerges with an alarming tale. But too often there's a more devastating conclusion - the girl is found, horribly murdered...or even worse, she remains hopelessly vanished, without a trace. With the aid of forensic experts, law enforcement officials, and family members, 15 cases are re-opened - cases that captivated the country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666906</url></doc>
