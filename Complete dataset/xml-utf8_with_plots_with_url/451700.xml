<plot>All that Daniel ever wanted to do was to make movies. All he ever did was sit at home, waiting for rejection slips from the foundations sponsoring young filmmakers until one day, Quentin Tarantino appeared in Daniel's dream, and told him to break into a video store to steal a camera. With glazed eyes and an M16, Daniel went in to the local video store and took hostages in order to get money from the Israeli Foundation for the Promotion of Cinema to finally make his film. He manages to befriend his hostages, but problems arise when the underground Fighting Israeli Cinema movement joins the fray and declares a revolution. "Bridging the gap between talking about film and making films - in one simple phrase, 'making movies'"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?451700</url></doc>
