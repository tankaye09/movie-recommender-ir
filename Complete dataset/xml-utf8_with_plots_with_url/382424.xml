<plot>With so much media and music today being saturated with violence, drugs and sex, the Music with Meaning tour brings rap and hip hop to high schools with a different message. As volunteers, local artists use music to teach students about respect for women, racism, and self-confidence. The "Music with Meaning" tour provides free concerts in high schools around Montreal, their goal is to use music to raise awareness about racism, peer pressure, and self respect. The show is organized by the CEO of Tru Kings Records and his team of speakers, DJs, MCs, and performers. Using hip hop and rap music, the artists teach students about the services that The Kids Help Phone has to offer and how to deal with difficult issues they face. In light of the negative influence mainstream music has today, the Music With Meaning tour breaks away from the stereotype and changes the way students think about themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382424</url></doc>
