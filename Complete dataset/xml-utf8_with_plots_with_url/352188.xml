<plot>Muggles Watching Films is an interactive program that introduces viewers to Chinese movies from both mainland China and Hong Kong. The show is hosted by Mr. Shi Hang who is a famous Chinese scriptwriter and film critic. A lot of his work have become very well-known in China including TV dramas like 'Lei Yu', 'Tie Chi Tong Ya Ji Xiao Lan' and 'She Diao Ying Xiong Zhuan'. He studied at the Chinese Central Academy of Drama and stayed on there as a lecturer. His in-depth discussions that are both informative and humorous have earned him much recognition and popularity both in academia and the media industry. Muggles Watching Films consists of a movie preceded by five minutes of discussion and another ten minutes afterward. In the initial five minutes, the host explains interesting background information about the film and gives the viewers some hints on critical points to look for while they watch. Following the screening of the film, the host offers a more detailed analysis. There is an element of audience participation: viewers can text message or email questions about the movie that the host will answer. They can also send requests of films that they would like to see in the show via text and email.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352188</url></doc>
