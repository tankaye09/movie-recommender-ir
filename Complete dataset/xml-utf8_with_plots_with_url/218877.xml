<plot>We go behind-the scenes to cover this high-stakes competition, witnessing the emotional roller-coaster ride during the feverish preparations of the chefs and organizers. Six semi-finals take place across the nation with each host city offering up on of their finest chefs. Coupled with these culinary stars are some of Canada's best known Olympic Athletes who serve as their assistants. It's all for a good cause - this competition is one of the key fundraising events leading up to Canada's hosting of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games. Each city's victor goes head to head in the Grand Finale - culminating months of hard work and emotional toil.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218877</url></doc>
