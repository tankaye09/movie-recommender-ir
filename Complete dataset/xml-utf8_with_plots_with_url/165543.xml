<plot>Wearing a black dress, too tight for her age, and too skimpy for the bitter weather, Maggie is picked up at a shabby street corner by a dark SUV. The unalarming man behind the wheel, John, takes her to a posh lounge, where Maggie tries to give him a hand-job. John cannot stand the sneers from the sophisticated crowd caused by the unsophisticated whore; he exists and leaves Maggie there by herself. Discomfort creeps upon her face when men who have had too much to drink start to approach her. Maggie leaves the lounge as well. The seemingly obvious prostitute-client relation soon turns around when Maggie gets into John's car for the second time. He takes her to a seedy alley; instead of receiving a sexual favor from 'the prostitute', John performs one on her. Immediately after climax, Maggie wants out. This time, however, John insists on a return of favor... verbal disputes soon turn into physical violence. The night evolves into a disaster and reveals more than the two are ready for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165543</url></doc>
