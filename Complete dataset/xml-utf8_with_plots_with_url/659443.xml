<plot>Summer prep art school session in Beijing. Two young men, Ocean and Wang Jing, are buddies. They think of music and girls a lot. Ocean works in his mother's tailor shop; his brother is serving a jail term for an unspecified offense. In the life drawing class, they meet a girl, Sugar. She seems more sophisticated and worldly than them. The playful, goofy innocence of their interaction gradually evolves into more complex feelings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659443</url></doc>
