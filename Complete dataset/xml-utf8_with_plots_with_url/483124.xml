<plot>To commemorate the 2003 Black History Month, ESPN is holding a roundtable discussion show focusing on the impact The March on Washington had not only on sports, but society in general. In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. defined the dream. Today, African American athletes are some of the most recognized people in the world.

This program attempts to answer that question while also tackling other issues of race and sport.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483124</url></doc>
