<plot>Simple title cards give us the day and date, from April 30 to August 15, in this film diary of a dog's pregnancy, the birth of six puppies, and their eventual departure to other families. A woman and three men in San Francisco do the filming; we see them with the dog, examining it during the pregnancy, taking it out, talking about what they know and how they feel. At the puppies' birth, at least two seem as if they won't make it. Fear and sorrow give way to elation when they do. The puppies nurse and grow. Parting is sweet sorrow, and not so sweet. Moods swing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014810</url></doc>
