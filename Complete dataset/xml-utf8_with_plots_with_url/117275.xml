<plot>In 1934 Charlie got pinched on a bogus Prohibition charge and sent to Alcatraz. There, a guy can have a lot of time on his hands, and for a guy like Charlie that's good, because he's always looking for a way to make things 'appear' like something they aren't. As he plots his escape you can bet he will find a way to retrieve the one thing back he wants the most, and that's the three coins that were confiscated from him during the arrest. Watch as Charlie maneuvers his way from felon back to freedom and settles some scores with those who crossed him along the way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117275</url></doc>
