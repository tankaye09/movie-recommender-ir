<plot>Joseph Marker has had enough of this. His little brother Hyrum ran away from home, and was later found naked up in a tree. His father Thomas doesn't leave the couch, and doesn't seem to care about much of anything anymore. His house has been toilet papered by vandals - again. And all of this is no big surprise. Caught between a father who has given up on life and a brother who more than anything wants to escape it, Joseph must decide between the responsibility that has been forced upon him, and the life he wants to live for himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279468</url></doc>
