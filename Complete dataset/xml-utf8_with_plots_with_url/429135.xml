<plot>Lee Bishop does not have the same problems as your average teenager. When his mother leaves for Iraq, Lee is forced to grow up quickly. As though maintaining his varsity spot on the wrestling team wasn't enough to deal with, his younger sister Tina decides to join the team. In addition Tina is being aggressively pursued by an upperclassman and since their father is out of the picture, Lee feels he is her only defense against the corrupting influences around her. Enter Joe Kross, the owner of a local gym, who agrees to help coach the wrestling team. Because Lee is without guidance, Joe's increasing influence threatens to push Lee over the precipice. Lee must decide how far he is willing to go to secure his own future while protecting his sister - all before personal demons, and an act of sexual violence threaten to destroy him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429135</url></doc>
