<plot>A group of predominately African American students travel from the Ivy League to the rebel state of Cuba. As outcasts within the elite cloistered environment of Yale University, they become intrigued by the revolutionary mystique of Cuba and its contentious relationship with the United States. After overcoming financial and political obstacles, the misfits take the field trip of a lifetime to the blockaded island. They witness extraordinary hip hop, reggae and rumba performances and strike up conversations with Cubans from all walks of life. The group is welcomed into a raucous block party with hundreds of people in an integrated neighborhood. Behind a cultural curtain created by political conflict, the students discover that Cuban people feel a close affinity with Africans and African Americans, and are deeply committed to ending racial injustice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062465</url></doc>
