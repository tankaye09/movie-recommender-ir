<plot>Patsy McGregor pays a call to Lizzie Murray. Patsy sends Lizzie's mother for a can of beer. As they were about to imbibe, Mr. Murray unexpectedly appears on the scene, and as he has no love for Patsy, they engage in a hot scrap, concluding with the old man throwing Patsy out. The old man is then left in possession of not only the house, but the beer as well. This is very exciting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471074</url></doc>
