<plot>This Documentary examines the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings. Much of the evidence shown opposes the view held by the 9/11 commission and the current administration. Experts in physics, engineering and demolition, as well as eye witnesses refute the possibility that the planes could have knocked the 3 buildings down, and that the likely explanation was in fact a controlled demolition. The question is by whom and why?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261174</url></doc>
