<plot>One day, Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and DK met together to share their wishes of their dreams. Then they got an idea: "Build a world on all our dreams!" They started to create their own world, naming it Mario Land. But then Wario started an argument of whose name is better to title this new world. While they were debating, Bowser invaded 'Mario Land'! When Koopa Troopa discovered Bowser has invaded, he ran toward Mario and company to tell the news. The only result was being ignored. When Toad couldn't stand it any longer, he announced "Why don't we name this land after the person who defeats Bowser?" So Mario and the gang agreed to Toad's suggestion. They started off on their new quest, dodging deep scape, meeting ghosts and pirates, trying to get their reward: Title of the new World.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?358464</url></doc>
