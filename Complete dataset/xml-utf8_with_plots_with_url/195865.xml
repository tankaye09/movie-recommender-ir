<plot>Early love represents all of what's exciting and magical about the teenage years, but it's also the source of some of the biggest dangers. Older boys pressure young girls to have sex, sometimes causing disease, pregnancy and depression; boys pressure other boys by linking conquest to popularity; and many teen romances end with dating violence. What prepares some kids to navigate this minefield, while others make mistakes? There's a dark side to early love, and there are ways to protect your children. "First Comes Love" ... but what will come next?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195865</url></doc>
