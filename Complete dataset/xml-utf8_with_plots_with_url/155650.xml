<plot>Diane Kurasik has seen all the classic films at the Greenwich Village revival theater she runs. Still single in a world of couples, Diane is reminded daily of how her life has not conformed to script. When she receives an eviction notice on the eve of her 40th birthday, her life is upended. In the pursuit of both the elusive apartment and a leading man, she tangles with a likely candidate who doesn't want the role, and gains an unexpected admirer who doesn't fit the profile.
