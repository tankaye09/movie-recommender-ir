<plot>A luxury hospital that was never completed is finished with words by its creator. About concrete frustrations. Designed as a hospital for well-off patients, the Israel American Medical Center has been going up in Tel Aviv since 1968, but it has never been finished. The architect who designed this building is invited to re-visit his unfinished work and venture into what were to have been huge emergency wards, splendid private rooms for patients and well-equipped physicians' surgeries. The abrasive contrast between desire and reality and between expectations and frustrations is present in this work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269526</url></doc>
