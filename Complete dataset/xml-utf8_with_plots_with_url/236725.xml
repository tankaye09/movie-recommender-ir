<plot>In this surreal animated saga, we get to know the tale of Princess Dawn, who must find the Whispering Orchid's cove (and the glass key therein hidden) in order to save her kingdom from the spell of melancholy, which has been placed by the evil Grump. To aid her, Princess Dawn summons young Terry Dexter, a boy from earth, and in their flying machine, accompanied by their bizarre pet Blip, they go through a myriad series of strange countries in a fantasy world in their quest for the key. But the Grump (a mix between a demon and a dwarf) is set to spoil their mission, following them close on their trail, atop a bumbling, allergic and stupid Dragon with which he has funny quarrels. Along the way, the Princess is Kidnapped, they meet Mother Goose, Blip finds true love, and Terry is corrupted (only to be turned back to normal later)... in a fantastic, kaleidoscopic series of adventures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236725</url></doc>
