<plot>Swinging London. Tom is desperate for a little excitement. He's sure the new secretary at the office fancies him. Reality never stands in the way of fantasy for Tom. His girl wants to settle down; his mum won't let him watch telly in peace. After all, he wasn't "brought up a navvy". He keeps clippings of fashion models hidden in a drawer, daydreaming that one is in his bedroom clad only in a negligée. He imagines his barber is a blonde, and that the girl at the grocer's lures him to the back with the cartons. He chats up a nice bit on the bus; she moves to another seat... Tom takes the Tube to Piccadilly. He buys himself a Carnaby St. cap to go with his mod check jacket. But the clerk in the men's shop criticizes Tom's sartorial sense. Tom pictures three birds fawning over him as he tries on a suit, the same way they go wild when he sings lead with the band playing at the discothèque. Or so he could do, if he wanted... Tom meets a posh girl in a saloon bar. Perhaps she'll like one of those "sophisticated" Swedish films...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370887</url></doc>
