<plot>"This picture was taken in front of Gen. Wheeler's headquarters at Camp Wikoff during Gen. Alger's tour of inspection of the camp. The two distinguished military men are seen overlooking the immense camp ground, and then turning and walking toward the camera. The negative is very fine photographically, and the portraiture unexcelled."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?211989</url></doc>
