<plot>It's wash day. Mabel works hard while her husband sleeps in. Next door, Fatty works hard while his wife bosses him about and dresses up to go out. The two neighbors meet outside: Fatty offers to let Mabel use his wringer. Her husband shows up just as her skirt gets caught in the wringer, and he's jealous. So is Fatty's wife when she hears the arguing. Later that day, both couples take a stroll, and, through a series of misadventures and innocently swapped purses, Mabel and Fatty's friendship blossoms, their spouses again think they have cause to be jealous, and the cops join the chaos.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349900</url></doc>
