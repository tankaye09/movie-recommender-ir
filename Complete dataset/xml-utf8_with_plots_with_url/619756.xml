<plot>An American woman, KERRY CARLSON (30) goes to County Kerry, Ireland with her boyfriend HUNTER (30s) to visit his childhood friend. Two weeks later, Kerry is found dead on a beach. Her mysterious death has destroyed the world of her best friend EMMA SAMSON (28) who was supposed to go on the trip with her but canceled at the last minute. A few weeks after her death, Emma starts having nightmares about Kerry's death. Believing that Kerry is trying to communicate to her in her dreams, Emma goes to Ireland to find out what really happened to her best friend. After arriving in the small, fishing village where Kerry died, Emma realizes the death was never really investigated and the locals don't want to talk to her. As she pieces together Kerry's last days from eye witness accounts, Emma becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and begins to believe that Kerry's death may not have been an accident. During her quest for answers, Emma goes on her own journey of self discovery as she tries to let go of the guilt she feels over Kerry's death and move on with her life. But she can't do that until she finds out what happened to Kerry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619756</url></doc>
