<plot>Two bad boys concieve the idea to play a trick on their Grandma and while she is in her old arm chair knitting, they fill the lamp chimney with flour and set the lamp in its accustomed place. One tickles Grandma behind the ear with a straw and annoys her to such an extent that she rises and seeing no one about, prepares to light the lamp. Immediately upon taking the chimney from the lamp, she is deluged with flour. She then discovers the boys under the table, and dragging out each one by the ear she dowses them in the flour barrel, and then gives them a good licking. The animation is exceedingly fine in this picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221759</url></doc>
