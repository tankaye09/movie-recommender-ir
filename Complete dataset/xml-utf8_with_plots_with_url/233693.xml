<plot>When Richard Bennett's computer consultancy business fails and he discovers that his wife, Deborah, is having an affair, his whole world comes crashing down. Out of desperation the couple pack up and take their young daughter Charlotte back to live with Deborah's grandfather Isaac in a remote, isolated, religious community where she was born. As first the plan is just to use the community as a safe haven until they regain their feet and start their lives again. However, as time passes and Richard's influence with the community grows, his plans change. After Richard apparently has a vision from God he is elected leader when Isaac dies. From then on Richard's power grows and his fanatical domination of the community knows no bounds and he starts to think of himself as God. Too late the community realizes that they have unleashed a demonic evil in their midst. Will they be able to overcome Richard's power or will he destroy the idyllic tranquility of the community in one last fiery act of purification???</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233693</url></doc>
