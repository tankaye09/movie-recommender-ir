To the outside world they pretend that he studies abroad. The only person Kiyoshi communicates to is his little sister. On the internet he has contact with youngsters who have all retreated from society and family life. It is with them that he talks about the things that occupy him most, such as drumming, sex, computer games, films, life and death.
