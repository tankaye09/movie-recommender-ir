<plot>Romantic drama set in a fantasy version of a gypsy camp telling of an amorous rivalry spanning two generations. Azurie (Rattan Bai) marries Zamorra (Jamshedji) rather than his rival Eureka (Mubarak). Later, Zamorra accuses his wife of adultery with his rival and she dies in the 'dance of death' inflicted on her as punishment. Her infant daughter Sitara (Khursheed), abandoned in the forest, grows up as the adopted daughter of Suresh but is unable to reconcile her gypsy habits with bourgeois society: she paints canvases with titles like 'Gypsy Blood'. She unknowingly gets embroiled in the ancestral rivalry when Eureka's wild son Tanzi (Nazir) falls in love with her and kidnaps her. The brutal tactic works and she marries him, which also leads her to discover her own ancestry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499273</url></doc>
