<plot>This is the incredible story of two orphans who were given a chance to dream... Durga, born in an impoverished village in Nepal, was orphaned at 10 years old - becoming Mom and Dad to her younger brother. She sent him to school while she worked at a gravel pit - chipping rocks. After being rescued by a Canadian NGO, Durga was given her first chance to go to school. Today she is 20 years old and graduating as a certified accountant. She is introduced to photographer Samantha Walker, who documents her life in photography - expressing the pain of the past to the hope of the present and future. After losing his family in the rebel wars in Liberia, Africa, Philip struggled through a series of UNBELIEVABLE events. Yet he seized opportunities that led him to become a top student at the University of Johannesburg. His encounter with singer-songwriter Andrew Smith is filled with emotion. Smith will write an instrumental song about Philip's experiences - while they journey back into his childhood of terror.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037466</url></doc>
