<plot>This film paints a fascinating portrait of Sean O'Casey: controversial playwright and one of the great figures of the Irish literary renaissance. Narrated and directed by Shivaun O'Casey - his daughter - the film profiles the writer's life of hardship and triumph, idealism and disenchantment. Topics under discussion include O'Casey's grim formative years; his activities in various socialist movements and in the movements for Irish independence; his satiric and often violent tragicomedies The Shadow of a Gunman, Juno and the Paycock, and The Plough and the Stars; and his later years in self-imposed exile in Britain</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482911</url></doc>
