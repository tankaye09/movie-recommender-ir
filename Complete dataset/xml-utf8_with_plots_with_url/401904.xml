<plot>Paola, Emma and Benedetta are sisters, but they have lost touch. It's their father's birthday and the three of them meet in the hospice where the old man lives, for what is supposed to be a happy family reunion. But they can't stop arguing, even in front of their old father. However, when the time comes to leave, they feel a deep need to be together. The sadness of the place, the ageing of their father, the knowledge that they can never reach the happiness they had in their childhood all contribute to a need for a strong drink together. Even though it's just for a short while, on an autumn afternoon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401904</url></doc>
