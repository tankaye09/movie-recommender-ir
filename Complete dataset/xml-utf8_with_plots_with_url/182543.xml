<plot>One of the traditions peculiar to Europe is the annual Eurovision Song Contest, in which hopeful singers from across the continent - from Slovenia to Sweden and Cyprus to Croatia - attempt to prove their nation's dominance in the field of pop music. Filmmaker Marina Zenovich (WHO IS BERNARD TAPIE?) took her cameras to host country Estonia - the winner in 2001 - to document preparations for the 2002 contest, and found a hotbed of jealous rivalries, national outrage and soap-opera-style scandals. Why did winning duo Tanel and Dave break up just weeks after their win? Why is handsome actor Mart Sander passed over for the presenter job? How does Tanel's sister react when she fails to make the cut for the 2002 contest? Through interviews and observation, Zenovich creates what the London Guardian described as "A Star is Born with extra snow."
