<plot>Doorman Bobby Whitaker arrives at work one morning and finds the elder Night Doorman has died in his sleep. As he takes over the Night Duties and begins to train a young replacement, he contemplates whether he is willing to continue his life as a doorman only to end up the same way. As he pulls multiple all night shifts, the presence of the lobby TV's only channel, the Game Show Network, begins to seep into Bobby's reality. A snarky 50s game show host begins to invade Bobby's thoughts and consciousness, constantly asking him what he's done with his life. Ultimately, despite a domineering boss and eager new recruit, Bobby realizes that the only thing in the world that cares if he's alive is the potted ficus he's been taking care of in the lobby. Bobby decides to steal the young plant and quit the doorman trade for good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579338</url></doc>
