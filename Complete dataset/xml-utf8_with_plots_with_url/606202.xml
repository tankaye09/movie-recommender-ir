<plot>This "Thrills of Music" short (production number 9953) headlines the Lecuona Cuban Boys, and before the audience was finished asking "Who?", disc jockey and platter-chatter host Fred Robbins (II)(if he is two, who was the first?)ups and informs that the group has grabbed off 12 World Exposition Grand Prizes for their music. Robbins did not explain whether that was all in one year, or scattered across several years, nor did he go into much detail about who or what the World Exposition was. The group performs "Dark Eyes," "Ti Pitin" and "Oye Mi Rumba." No one shows up also to explain why the word was sometimes spelled "rumba" and other times 'rhumba."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606202</url></doc>
