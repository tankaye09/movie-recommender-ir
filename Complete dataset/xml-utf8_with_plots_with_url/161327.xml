<plot>The Fam are a crew living the dream, signed to a major label, Number One in the charts, the world is at their feet. The question is, when guns, gangsters, drugs and money follow success, how long can they hold onto it and how far are they willing to go, to keep it? With such a long way to fall, The Fam begin to self destruct, until it's not just a question of keeping it together, it's a matter of staying alive. More like brothers than friends, Devil and Millz began it all, and their whole life has been about making music and dreaming of success. The Fam is that dream. Laurissa is the first lady of The Fam, adding beauty, an incredible voice and a serious cocaine habit to the line up, and then there's Mikey who's got energy, charm, good looks and which ever girl he chooses to take home. With a ruthless and violent manager behind them, brutal gangsters all around them, and fame, money and everything they ever dreamed of in front of them, can they do anything to stop their explosive and fatal fall from grace?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161327</url></doc>
