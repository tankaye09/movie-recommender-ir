<plot>"A companion picture to 'Who's Got the Red Ear?' The scene is the same, but in this instance one of the young girls goes away for a minute. The young man takes advantage of the opportunity by starting into make violent love to the girl who remains. The other girl returns, and spying them from behind a corn shock spoils their fun by pushing the shock over on them. The presence of a number of ducks and chickens, and an old dog in the picture lends a realism which must be seen to be appreciated. This picture is immensely popular wherever it has been shown."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345407</url></doc>
