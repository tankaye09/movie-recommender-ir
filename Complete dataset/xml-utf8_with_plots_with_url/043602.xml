<plot>Prasanna (Kamal Haasan) is nursed back to health after a bloody fight by singer Bhairavi (Srividya). The two are slowly drawn to each other and they decide to marry inspite of their age gap, and a past relationship she is still unextricably tied to. In the meantime, Prasanna's father (Sundarrajan) embarks on a relationship with a younger girl Ranjini (Jayasudha). Both relationships are given a new twist by the addition of an unexpected new variable. A couple of daring concepts thrown in, but too much of the standard tamil film melodrama and reliance on fabulous coincidences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043602</url></doc>
