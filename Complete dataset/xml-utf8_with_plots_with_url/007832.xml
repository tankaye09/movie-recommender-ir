<plot>In this musical treasure, Bobby finds a dog on the way home from school and sneaks him home, but his strict father won't have a dog in his house and intends to punish Bobby. The pixies and dwarfs in the pictures on Bobby's wall come to the rescue and take his father to Pixie Court and put him on trial for being neurotic and erratic and child-like. It's a real surprise to find out who the judge is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007832</url></doc>
