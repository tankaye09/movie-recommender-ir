<plot>In 1995, two young women ventured out onto the open road, across the United States, to document a subculture they knew very little about: the lifestyle of the American truckdriver. Living with them in their trucks and seeing the country through their point of view, Adrianne Jorge and Tamy Ojala videotaped the everyday lives of these men and women as they drove from state to state, day and night, delivering and picking up the everyday products of our consumer society. A no-budget verite' documentary, Truck attempts to capture a way of life in which work and survival take on a whole new meaning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619315</url></doc>
