<plot>The World Wrestling Federation's predecesor to "Monday Night RAW" and "Raw is War"; "WWF Prime-Time Wrestling" was a weekly two-hour program, which aired on the USA Network from 1986 to 1993. The program went through three distinct formats: 1. From 1986-1991, hosts Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan introduced matches and analyzed them afterward. 2. In 1991, the show used an audience participation-type format, with hosts Vince McMahon and Heenan. WWF wrestlers were the frequent guests. 3. From 1992-1993, McMahon, Heenan, Monsoon and two other members of the WWF cast (one a face, or good guy; the other a heel, or bad guy) participated in a roundtable discussion about the goings-on in the WWF. In all versions, the program featured wrestling matches, interviews, promos featuring WWF wrestlers, updates of current feuds and announcements of upcoming local and pay-per-view events.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645454</url></doc>
