<plot>Great Balls of Fire is a multimedia installation that explores acts of seeing. The installation environment is an everyday living room, one from which anyone might have witnessed the limiting loop of information on September 11, 2001, and the days that followed. It also has characteristics of a personal library, a realm of interpretation, translation, and the a/v equipment and guts and system wires are showing. The video intercuts homeless visionary James E. Jones's sidewalk commentary with the visual task of an observer trying to grasp those 48 hours during and after the attacks. Horror and humor run on a loop - at once whetting stone and inoculation. In this constructed context of the quintessential living room/personal library, one is asked to re-experience the act of seeing, making sense, and remembering those days, the time that has since passed, and by extension, any day in history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222219</url></doc>
