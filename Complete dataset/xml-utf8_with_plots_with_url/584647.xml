<plot>A young widow with two babies is looking for work, but she cannot find a position that would allow her to care for her children.

Because the institution is under-staffed and under-funded, the widow's baby, like the many other children there, faces many unfortunate hazards and disadvantages.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584647</url></doc>
