<plot>The Human Space war against the Outsiders was set to destroy both races and this region of the galaxy along with them... and us. Higher order beings intervene against this. The Gardeners will erase one race to restore the balance, but which one? A solution is found. A champion is elected from each fleet and a contest to death set between them. There is no time limit, food or water. Their champion is a fully armed cyborg. Our champion is a weaponless, pregnant woman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581048</url></doc>
