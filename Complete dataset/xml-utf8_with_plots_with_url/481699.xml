<plot>They call him Scotch because he's so smooth. What woman isn't turned on by a dab of aioli on a waggling tongue? By day, he's a voice actor on the children's cartoon show, 'Hair of the Dog.' By night (or early afternoon), he's the best customer at his local bar... until one Christmas Eve, when his show is canceled and suddenly he's just another unemployed Hollywood drunk. It gets worse at 2 a.m., when alcohol sales throughout Los Angeles are prohibited for the next four hours, and all Scotch wants is one more drink.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481699</url></doc>
