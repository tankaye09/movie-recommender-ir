<plot>In a world where romance has been replaced by speed dating, is arranged marriage the hassle-free way of getting hitched in the new millennium? This documentary takes a lighthearted look at young American Desis who are willingly placing their destiny in the hands of their parents, marriage brokers, and internet matrimonial ads. Navigating us through the film is Rupa Gawle - a young, hip, and very single popular Desi columnist. As she tries to understand how young, successful South Asian-Americans would want to subject themselves to the age-old tradition of arranged marriages, we are introduced to a cast of colorful characters who will tell us exactly why.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652259</url></doc>
