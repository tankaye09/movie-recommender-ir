<plot>Unlike her previous cable-TV interview series, Exhale With Candice Bergen, actress Bergen wasted little time with the standard, sedate couch-and-desk format on Candice Checks It Out. Instead, the host emulated both Charles Kuralt and George Plimpton, going on the road in search of courageous women who lived "on the edge," and as often as possible participated in her guests' adventurous activities. Among the professionals profiled on the series were female astronauts, wild-animal trainers, "ladies who luge," bungie-jumpers, street performers, and even dominatrixes. In other words, it was Murphy Brown for real.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092677</url></doc>
