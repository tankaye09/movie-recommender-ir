<plot>Babu is a naive, young man who likes to go out of his way to help people. He has fallen in love with Kammo, but in the process of helping another, he lands himself in jail for two years. When he returns he finds that a lady who had once helped him, is now destitute, a widow with a small child. He drops everything, and decides to help this widow and her child. He gives up his personal life, drives a hand-drawn rickshaw, saves some money, so that he can buy provisions for them, as well as send the child, Pinky, to a decent school. Pinky does attend school, but ends up a snob, who is clearly embarrassed by her poor mom, and cannot stand Babu, making them both wonder if it was worthwhile investing so much time and energy over an ungrateful child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054488</url></doc>
