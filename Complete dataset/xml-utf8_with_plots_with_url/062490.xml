<plot>Nimord and Zuker, two close friends, are use to sit around the local park and discuss daily affairs. Beautiful Tamar suddenly walks by them, as both of them immediately fall in love with her. The three then decide to embark on a triangular journey, vivid, yet comprehensively demanding in its sub-textual and libidinal virtues, up the street, while Tamar eventually has to allegedly decide which of the two fellows is her favorite. Her one conclusion is that Nimrod satisfies her intellectually while Zuker satisfies her sexually, as an (in)evitable outcome must come.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062490</url></doc>
