<plot>Eleanor Carmel is in a snit. Ever since her new neighbor, Mr. Mackenheim, the former ruler of a distant alien planet, moved in, all the cats in the neighborhood have been disappearing. She confronts him, but the smooth talking Mackenheim seduces her into a romantic dinner at his house. It's all going well for the very single Eleanor, until she realizes it's all a ruse. Mackenheim's only after her cat. But the wily alien quickly learns never to come between a woman and her cat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350318</url></doc>
