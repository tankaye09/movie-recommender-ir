<plot>Sometime before the beginning of World War 3, a young man tries to poison a bunny rabbit for eating from his perfect little garden. As a result, he soon discovers that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, when his home becomes infested with maggots, and flies are ruining his meals and his peace. To win back control of his home he must defeat the tiny enemy invaders in an epic battle. [The film was photographed with a digital still camera and eight thousand still images were put together to create a flipbook movie.]</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344078</url></doc>
