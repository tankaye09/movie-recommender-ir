<plot>Francis Coppola wanted a classically based score realized completely on electronic synthesizers. This documentary explores this hyper creative phase including the composition and recording of the landmark synthesized soundtrack. The score went through many transformations; originally six or seven songs by The Doors were to be used. (Only "The End" remained as the film's opening.) The documentary reveals the influence of the Japanese arranger Tomita and his quadraphonic ideas. Also featured is The Grateful Dead's drummer Mickey Hart who designed a percussion-based score for the film. And of course The Doors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577967</url></doc>
