<plot>An independent film using the streets, buildings and parks of NYC as sets that was distributed by bottom-feeder Madison Pictures which means it was barely distributed at all, as Madison was mostly the supplier of changed-title PRC films made a decade or so earlier. Marty (James Lipton) is a shipping clerk in the garment district and a wise guy trying to cut corners and get by on angles, and not very good at it. He meets Helen (Gaby Rodgers) and decides to change his ways, but lack of patience in slow-progress jobs leads him to become involved with a neighborhood gang.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?543533</url></doc>
