<plot>Another one of the many "voice-only" Movietone shorts and/or newsreels in which radio actor and sportscaster Paul Douglas toiled for a decade before getting his break-out role in 1949's "A Letter to Three Wives." Douglas did most of these displaying the wryness and humor that personalized most of his acting roles. This also is yet another seemingly never-ending tributes to Florida that appeared to pop up weekly in shorts-produced-in Hollywood and shot-in-Florida for about a decade following WW II. Evidently, the Florida Chamber of Commerce was more willing to spend money on self-promotion than its counterpart in California.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351911</url></doc>
