<plot>Mangal Singh is the head of a village that gets it's revenue by selling cocaine. When Police Inspector Kisna finds out he goes to live incognito with the villagers to try and talk them out of dealing with drugs. He meets and falls in love with Mangal's daughter, Savi, and gets married to her. When the time comes he asks Mangal and the villagers to surrender the drugs to the police. When they agree to do so, the police are summoned, and to Kisna's horror and disbelief a large number of the villagers are gunned down, many of who die, while others, including Mangal himself, are crippled for life. The villagers no longer trust Kisna and drive him out. The police arrest Kisna, he is tried in Court and sentenced to several years in jail. Seven years later, Kisna escapes from prison and returns to the village. Nothing is the same anymore. He has a son who refuses to acknowledge him, the villagers call him a coward, Savi and Mangal will have nothing to do with him, and the new head of the village, Jinda, wants him dead at any cost.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287503</url></doc>
