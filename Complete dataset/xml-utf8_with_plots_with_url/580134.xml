<plot>There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was produced by IMP, or released by Universal at this time. Chances are production of the film was either suspended before completion, or else the title was changed before release, quite possibly to avoid confusion with the similarly titled Vitagraph release The Old Guard (1913) (q.v.).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580134</url></doc>
