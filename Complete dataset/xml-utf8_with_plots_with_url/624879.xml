<plot>Jos van Pinxteren has been a smuggler all his life. When he is caught in 1941 by the Nazi's for the illegal slaughter of a pig, he ends up in the Ukraine. Now Jos has Alzheimer and Korsakoff disease. History literally fades, makes way for a bare insight in Jos' character. At the same time we see Ukraine's more recent history: the accident with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power-plant, where radiation-particles have disappeared, but the radiation is not gone, and people of an Ukrainian mountain-village. They do not talk about what has happened amidst them. Or does someone still know about Pieter Menten, a well-known Dutch war-criminal?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624879</url></doc>
