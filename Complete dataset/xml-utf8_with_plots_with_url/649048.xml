<plot>Robin and Rachel are a two-some, they need each other and they spend a lot of time together, mostly shopping, looking for pretty things, or the next lotion or potion to ward off aging. When out and about together they are often ignored, almost invisible to the people they enjoy observing while sitting on a park bench or eating ice cream at the local mall. On the surface their ventures may seem unimportant, but they function as bonding rituals affecting a generational continuity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649048</url></doc>
