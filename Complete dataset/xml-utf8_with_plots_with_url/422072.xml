<plot>This scene was taken shortly after the completion of the railroad in 1899. The impression received by the audience is that of riding on the pilot of an engine. Shortly after starting, you plunge into the darkness of the tunnel, afterwards to emerge, and crossing a high trestle skirting the edge of a deep chasm, you continue to wind about among the mountains and gorges. The ice-covered peaks of the distant mountains form an ever changing background.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422072</url></doc>
