<plot>Billy Hunt's life is pretty good; from the loving relationship he shares with his partner, Lisa, to the successful restaurant he runs with his mentor, Gary. Following the death of his estranged grandmother, his only living relative, Billy finds himself haunted by painful childhood memories that had long since been buried. He had been sent to live with his grandmother when he was just twelve years old and remembered nothing of his time before. But as the memories begin to creep back, Billy is driven to the point of obsession; the very trait that has made him successful threatens to bring about his downfall. Billy is willing to risk everything, his business, his relationship with Lisa, to find out the truth about his past, leaving only one question unanswered: How much will he sacrifice?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133099</url></doc>
