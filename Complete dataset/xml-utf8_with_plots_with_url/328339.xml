<plot>THE BIOGRAPHICAL DOCUMENTARY OF A FEARLESS MILITARY LEADER Pain, destruction and suffering cannot conquer the infallible war hero Oscar Jackson in "Left for Dead." He lives through injuries that would overcome most men. A natural leader, Jackson abandons his studies of law to recruit his own company of Ohio soldiers, who then serve with the Ohio Brigade. Consumed by the Union's cause, Jackson fights in some of the deadliest battles of the Civil War, including the Battle of Corinth where he is blasted in the face with a musket ball. Thought to be mortally wounded, the captain is "Left for Dead." The invincible Jackson not only survives -- he continues to lead his company until the end of the war, despite the lingering effects of the bullet still lodged in his head. Jackson thrives both on and off of the battlefield, later becoming a U.S. Congressman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328339</url></doc>
