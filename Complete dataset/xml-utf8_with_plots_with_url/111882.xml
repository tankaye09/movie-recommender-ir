<plot>Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen: This classic comedy concert film launched the careers of Tim Allen, Chris Rock and Jackie The Joke Man Martling. It also features the definitive performance of legendary Bill Hicks. The Heavyweights of Comedy: "Fat is where it's at!" This heavy film was shot on the same weekend as Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen. It features 8 of the heaviest and funniest comedians ever. Among these comedians are some rare jewels, including Bob Woods who died in 1990 . Woods' comic impression of Jackie Gleason is considered among comedians as the definitive Gleason impersonation of all time. You will also recognize Tim O'Rourke as the bartender from the "Drew Carey Show" and Thea Vidale who had her TV series, "Thea". This uncensored, no holds barred comedy film ends in a comic feast so large that even the chairs could not hold them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111882</url></doc>
