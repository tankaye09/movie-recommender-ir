<plot>Remember, this is not one of those old style couchee-couchee scenes, but a perfect picture of a street in Cairo, showing camels, Bedouins, Egyptians and masked face women natives of Egypt, showing off in fine shape the beautiful and Got Me costumes worn by both male and female natives. This picture is a perfect specimen of the photographic art. Clear and distinct; life in every inch of it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518205</url></doc>
