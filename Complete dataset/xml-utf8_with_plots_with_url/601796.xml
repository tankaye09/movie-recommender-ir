<plot>Patty Cauldron, wife of noted food critic Nemo Cauldron, has become dissatisfied with her increasingly boring life as the wife of a food connoisseur. Her husband's business trips leave her home alone for long periods of time and her desire (and mind) begins to wander. Coming home from a particularly excessive trip, Nemo discovers that Patty has been having an affair, and the fists begin to fly. Patty defends herself with a kitchen knife, planting it in her husband's back- opening up her mind to a new world of paranoia, mistrust, and madness. A macabre tale ensues, as Patty meets several strange caricatures along the way: A naive farm boy, cannibalistic backwoods hicks- could these people be real? Or do they only exist in her mind, a place just as dangerous? Paranoiac reality and escapist fantasy parallel and interact as the story is told through comic book styled reality and stylized comic panel fantasy sequences in the tradition of 1950's horror comics, such as E.C.'s Tales From the Crypt and The Vault of Horror.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?601796</url></doc>
