<plot>With almost 40 years of history and hits behind them, Steve Miller Band has churned out some of the greatest and most memorable anthems of their generation. Songs like "Fly Like An Eagle", "Rockin' Me" and "Take The Money And Run" still sound fresh today and continue to turn young fans on to the magic of the band's sound. One look at the audience that attended the band's two sold-out nights at Chicago's famed Ravinia, and it becomes clear that this is a group that continues to develop an ardent fan base while drawing long-time fans eager to hear their favorites time and time again. Steve Miller Band is as vital today as ever. This three disc set (2 DVD/1 CD) is the ultimate addition to any Steve Miller Band fan's - or fan of great music in general's - DVD collection. The first DVD features 20 of the band's greatest hits along with a few rare gems captured live over two nights in glorious High Definition with 32 cameras. The second DVD is an all-new, never-before-released documentary that includes a private tour of Chicago with Steve Miller himself - join Steve as he takes you on a personal musical journey of the sights and sounds of the city that inspired him. This disc also includes a bonus narrated photo slide show, featuring a number of photos from Steve's personal collection. Lastly, there is a Greatest Hits Live collection of all of the SMB favorites. This triple-disc set comes in a beautiful, expanded digipak, with a full color booklet and numerous bonus features.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?515463</url></doc>
