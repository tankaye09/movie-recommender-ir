<plot>Neal and his wife, Vera, are having an argument. Vera, while trying to teach their cook the Charleston, lets Neal's breakfast burn, and the argument is also heating up. He tells her that if he ran his office the way she runs their house, it would be in a mess all of the time. She challenges him to stay home and take care of the house and she will take his place at the office. He takes her up on it and she is barely out of sight before he has caused the cook/maid to quit. He has many problems with the ice-box, the iceman and the washing machine, and everything is in shambles where Vera comes home, and tells him what an easy day she had. She neglects to tell him it was Labor Day and the office was closed for the holiday.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372832</url></doc>
