<plot>Have you ever fallen in love with a complete stranger? Hummingbird is a short film about that moment of "What if?". Set in an urban landscape, a young man daydreams about a girl he has never even talked to. Her idealized image leads him to action outside of his regular routine. The film explores our impulsive romantic desires and the idealism of our imaginations, influenced by the romanticizing effect of music.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250050</url></doc>
