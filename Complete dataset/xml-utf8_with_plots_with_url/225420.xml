<plot>We've all had Friday nights with nothing to do. We all, however, do not have friends like Ray. Gutter Balls follows Ray, a neurotic homophobe, who literally "drives" his friend Pete insane on their futile search for something exciting to do. Having recently broken up with his girlfriend, Pete is looking for anything involving "hot girls and alcohol" to get his mind off his ex. Unfortunately, his unstable friend Ray prevents this from happening with a dizzying array of questions and paranoia that unfolds into a hilarious sequence of events culminating with a bowling disaster.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225420</url></doc>
