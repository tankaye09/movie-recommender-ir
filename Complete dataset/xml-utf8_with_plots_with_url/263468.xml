<plot>In the Shadow of the Condor documents an expedition in January of 2002 into the spectacular pristine Corcovado wilderness in Southern Chile. The expedition traveled up a "heart of darkness" river, bushwhacked through a vertical jungle, and then emerged out into a magnificent landscape of glaciated granite walls. Filmmaker Michael Brown and Chilean conservationist Pablo Sandor climbed upward to find a jewel of a lake tucked between the highest peaks. Sandor and his Ayacara Foundation are working to protect the Corcovado region from development and the United Nations has just selected Ayacara to receive a prestigious conservation award. Ayacara leaders give important credit for the award to Brown's film, which dramatized for U.N. and the Chilean Government's decision makers first-hand why the region should be included in a national park. "In the Shadow of the Condor" was produced by Outside Television, in association with OLN.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263468</url></doc>
