<plot>Morgan Stipe is not a film maker. He is a self centered dreamer from small town Rhode Island, obsessed with becoming a Hollywood player, regardless of the cost. Driven by ego, Morgan launches a new production company "A Flash of Yellow Pictures," relying entirely upon the efforts and connections of others. His childhood friend, Quinley Blais, a successful Rhode Island videographer, is dragged into Morgan's twisted universe, grudgingly subsidizing Morgan's dream by providing the technical know how and by hosting the gala cocktail party celebrating the rollout of the fledgling production company. All the while, Morgan's dutiful girlfriend, Mel Cafferty, tries to salvage their relationship in spite of Morgan's relentless pursuit of fame. Morgan's real ace in the hole is a dirty little secret - known only to himself and an old friend who has already hit the big time: the now famous falling star and local hero, Jacob Mattison. With this long standing debt of silence to Morgan hanging over his head, the deeply troubled Jake is forced to be the centerpiece of the party and the catalyst for Morgan's ambitions, at the same time that he must face up to his estranged family and deal with his own demons. But will Morgan's own past will rise to face him as he trades away his soul for fame and fortune ? So as the dozens of colorful characters arrive at the party to reach for the brass ring of fame on the silver screen, friendships are strained, love is tested and dreams are made and broken by ambition, greed and desperation as each one struggles to get free of the past and, finally, get out of Rhode Island.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213641</url></doc>
