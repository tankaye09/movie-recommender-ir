<plot>Gandy Goose is induced to become an Army Air Corps pilot by a hardboiled flight commander, a rooster and it only takes a short time to discover that Gandy has no equilibrium or sense of direction. The training progresses from desperate difficulties to ignominious disaster, before the rooster pronounces Gandy ready for a solo flight, which also does not end well. The rooster then takes Gandy up for a flight and orders him to bail out and then kicks him out. Gandy takes the rooster with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198567</url></doc>
