<plot>Sayoko is a junior college student whom everyone thinks is too aggressive: she gets fired from a boutique job for slapping around shoplifters, then fired from a gas station job for beating up a molester. One day she gets in a confrontation with Ami, a Korean living in Tokyo who constantly berates the Japanese for being too passive. By coincidence, Ami rescues Sayoko's little sister a few days later.
