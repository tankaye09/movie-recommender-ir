<plot>A man awakes in his bedroom and is aroused by the view from his window. His neighbor asks him via intercom whether he will accompany her for a morning swim. He says he will. Before he can exit his apartment wearing swim wear, he must first become unaroused. Meanwhile, as his neighbor applies sunscreen lotion while waiting in the hallway, she becomes aroused. When the man is ready to exit, the woman is ready for indoor activities. During the ups and downs of one man's morning, he discovers that love has as much to do with timing as with desire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557900</url></doc>
