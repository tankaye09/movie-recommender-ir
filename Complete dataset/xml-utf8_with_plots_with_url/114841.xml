<plot>"'Courtesy of the Red, White &amp; Blue'" - Discusses the Toby Keith post-9/11 song. "'The Pill'" - Examines Loretta Lynn's 1975 hit, banned by many stations. "'Independence Day'" - Analyzes response to Martina McBride's song and video on domestic violence, which re-emerged after the brutal murder of Nicole Simpson. "'Would You Lay With Me In A Field of Stone'" - Revisits the mid-1970s hit by Tanya Tucker, then an underage adolescent singing about sex. "'Indian Outlaw'" - Presents several points of view on the Tim McGraw novelty hit, including a wide range of perspectives of famous Native Americans. "Johnny Cash vs. Music Row" - Focuses on Cash's battle in the 1980s to convince radio stations to keep playing his songs, in the middle of a shift to promoting younger artists exclusively. "'John Walker Blues'" - Explores Steve Earle's song about American expatriate John Walker Lindh, the center of a firestorm for his service as a Taliban soldier. "Kris Kristofferson" - Looks in particular at the singer-songwriter's famed "Sunday Morning Coming Down," a hit for Johnny Cash despite (or due to) lines such as "wishin' Lord that I was stoned." "'Okie from Muskogee'" - Presents the Merle Haggard song of small-town life, questioned by some for expressing what they described as "divisive" political opinions. "Murder They Wrote" - Examines famous songs of violent death, such as Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues" and the Dixie Chicks' "Goodbye Earl." "'Stand By Your Man'" - Discusses Tammy Wynette's most famous song and its reception by feminist groups at the time of its release ... and long after.
