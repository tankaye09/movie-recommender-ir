<plot>Laura, a young woman from an impoverished desiring to be an actress, finds achieving success to be more of a struggle than she anticipated. She meets the wealthy Willard Brockton, and seduced by his gifts, realizes she will no longer have to financially struggle if she takes "The Easiest Way" and become his mistress. While living the high-life of luxury, she meets and falls in love with writer John Madison, who forgives her past transgressions as she was so desperate to escape poverty. Madison has to leave her to make his fortune to get enough money so they can marry, and while they are separated, Laura falls back on hard times. She returns to her wealthy benefactor, Brockton, and becomes his mistress. When a wealthy Madison returns two months later, he finds out what she has done and rejects her. Brockton also abandons her, repulsed by her greed. Laura must now find another man to support her or commit suicide.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554772</url></doc>
