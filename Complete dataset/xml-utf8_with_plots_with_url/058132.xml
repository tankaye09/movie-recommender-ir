<plot>Where are they now? A documentary look at what's become of Curious George, former star of children's books,= - with talking-head commentary by Raggedy Ann and Andy as well as by Harold, the boy with the purple crayon. George himself and his agent also comment. George has dealt with alcoholism; he harbors hard feelings, and justifiably so, toward the Man with the Yellow Hat. But, George also remains optimistic. What's the future for any of these former stars?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058132</url></doc>
