<plot>Lynn is a thirty something Chef who has it all; a great job, an eccentric but loving mother, and very caring friends who watch out for each other. She is a tough city girl that pulls no punches when it comes to her sense of humor, or life in general. Something is missing though. Through a seemingly misdialed phone call, Lynn meets the man of her dreams. A man she has never seen, but only heard his voice. Even when they are physically together, he requires her to wear a blindfold. Their relationship evolves into a Dominant/submissive game of intrigue that she must keep a secret from everyone she knows. With her giving him complete control over her, her vulnerability eventually becomes her demise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433236</url></doc>
