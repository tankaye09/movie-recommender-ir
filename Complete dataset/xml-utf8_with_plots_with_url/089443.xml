He has encrypted this project in code words known only to him and his daughter, Reshma. Then Wong abducts his wife, Paro, and blackmails the professor. The Professor is ready to turn over the project to Wong, when Wasco abducts Reshma and holds her for ransom in exchange for the same project. C.I.D.
