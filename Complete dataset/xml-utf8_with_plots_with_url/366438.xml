<plot>Child-hood sweethearts, Ajay and Durga, decide to get married. While Ajay re-locates to Bombay, where he gets a job as a Police Inspector, finds accommodation, and then asks Durga to join him, which she does. The only difference between them is that Durga has never learned to spell and write in English as there is a jinx in her family. Durga, with the help of Gangu, soon finds out that there are a lot of problems in her neighborhood, mainly with the way Assistant Superintendent of Police, Chaurasiya, who is also Ajay's boss, conducts himself. Durga decides to expose him, but before that could happen, she herself gets entrapped in a web of lies, deceit, and corruption, is arrested and tried in Court for Prostitution. Watch what impact this will have on Ajay and their married life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366438</url></doc>
