<plot>Janki Kapoor (Nutan) and her two sons (Ravi Kapoor and Vicky Kapoor) come from a poor middle class family, and have difficulties making ends meet. To add to this burden, the family has to content with the waywardness of Vicky Kapoor, who is always getting into trouble with the law, and getting into fights. Vicky is determined to get a job overseas Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as he has heard of thousands of Indians making a successful living there. Ravi arranges for his visa and the money to go to Dubai. Once in Dubai, the Kapoors receive no word from him, and eventually give up on him. Vicky has encountered problems in Dubai, as he was cheated out of a job, as he had obtained a visa under false pretences. In order to remain in Dubai, he must work for an international and ruthless smuggler named Rana (Paresh Rawal), and must earn his keep or be turned over to the authorities. Memorable songs: "Chithi aai hai vatan se, chithi aai..."; "Tu kal chala jayega to main kya karunga, tu yaad bahut aayega to main kya karunga..."; "Amiron ki shyam, garibon ke naam...."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?387512</url></doc>
