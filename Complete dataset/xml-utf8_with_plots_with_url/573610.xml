<plot>Two teams, each composed of a celebrity and a contestant, played. A giant electronic screen flashed a question, with the first team to answer correctly winning one point. The first team to five points played a pinball game on a giant 20-by-12 foot machine. Each team member manned one of the two flippers, and the object was to keep the ball in play for 60 points by hitting bumpers which were worth prizes and other noisemakers, but by avoiding "out" holes which stopped play on that ball. If after two balls, the teams earned 15,000 points (or 1,000 less than that upon subsequent visits), the team played Money Ball with cash awards given for hitting certain areas of the pinball machine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573610</url></doc>
