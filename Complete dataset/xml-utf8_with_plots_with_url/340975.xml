<plot>John is a lonely man who lives in a torn, dirty flat, eating cold take-away, where his only company are the girls on his porn tapes and the babes in his fantasy. However, he imagines himself a vintage hero, a man's man, who the dames can't resist. But when his neighbor, Mrs. Robinson, another pathetic soul, dies in a most unflattering way, John realizes he needs to change if he doesn't want to meet the same end. Always worried about others' perception of him, he changes his music, clothes, and reading material, and even cleans his flat, thinking it will do. However, it's not the outside that counts and contrary to his efforts, nightmares of an undignified death start to haunt him, pushing him closer and closer to his inevitable doom. In a silly way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340975</url></doc>
