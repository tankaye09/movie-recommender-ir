<plot>"RÄƒsunÄƒ Valea" (Reverberating Valley in translation) is a classic communist inspirational movie about the building of a railroad through the mountains. Thousands of young volunteers sign up to work on the site. There's tunnels to be drilled, rock to be blasted, earth to be moved... Besides the work there are other perilous things jeopardizing the site such as the malevolence of persons such as lazy Niki-the brigadier-(brigadier=rank in the communist work forces in Romania, similar to a foreman). Conspiracy also seems to be aiming at putting the project in peril. Towards the end of the movie, everybody seems to realize that they need to work together for the good of others by building the railroad. The enemies of the project-some of which are even brigadiers- are being exposed and face the consequences of their betrayal. The peasant Ion leads the pack who finally gets the railroad built.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?455859</url></doc>
