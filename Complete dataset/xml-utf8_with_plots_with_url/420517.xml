<plot>"Paint it Black" is an intense psychological ride into the heart of Los Angeles' 80's punk scene. Fitch's indelible heroine, Josie Tyrell, after rescuing herself from a meager white-trash existence, finds herself at a crossroads when her lover, Michael Faraday, unexpectedly commits suicide. As in her previous work, Fitch masterfully explores the relationship of two complex characters as Josie and her lover's overbearing mother, Meredith Loewy, battle over his love even after his death, leaving Josie to unravel the mystery of Michael's death that will leave audiences guessing until the redemptive climax.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420517</url></doc>
