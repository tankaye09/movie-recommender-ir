<plot>Film Specialist Chakra D. Dhari lives a poor lifestyle in a flat in Mumbai, is unable to pay his rent, but is determined to make a Bollywood movie at any and all costs. He manages to con Tiku, a Japan-based businessman, to finance a film, on the condition that the movie is produced by yesteryear heroine, Barkharani. That done, Chakra goes about recruiting a lead actor, a photographer, a dance director as well as a former beauty queen, Yukta Mookhey, and an established South Indian actress, Sana Shaikh, and takes them on location to Japan. Chakra will soon find out that his entire cast and crew have not only a secret agenda of their own, but the work on the movie will soon also be hampered by the presence of gangsters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345376</url></doc>
