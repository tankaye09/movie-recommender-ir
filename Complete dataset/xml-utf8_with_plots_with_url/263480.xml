<plot>The Internationally Multi-Award Winning Feaure In the Shadow of the Palms is the Only documentary filmed in Iraq prior to, during, and after the fall of Saddam Hussein. It documents the changes in Iraqi society, and the lives of ordinary Iraqis by focusing on a cross-section of individuals. The film presents audiences with a window into the everyday realities for those living through this controversial war. The film documents how life is for the society and people living under twelve years of sanctions and the regime of Saddam Hussein. When the inevitability of the US-led conflict increased and people across the globe protested the war, the filmmakers recorded the changes in the lives of the Iraqi people, focusing on a cross-section of individuals representative of the broader Iraqi community. The film follows these individuals as they prepare for the coalition war against their country and as it becomes the target for tens of thousands of coalition cruise missiles and guided bombs. The film shows first hand the effects of the bombing campaign on the lives of civilians.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263480</url></doc>
