<plot>Johnny Murdock (Johnny Mack Brown),who hasn't seen his father for some time, learns at Gold Flats that he has been killed by road agents, according to mining engineer Carter Morgan (Bill Kennedy) of Brandon Enterprises. He doesn't inform Johnny that Mark Brandon (Steve Darrell) has secretly inherited the rich claim. Johnny's old friend, Dusty Hanover (Raymond Hatton), gives Johnny an old poster which shows Brandon to be an escaped convict. They advise prospector Cramer (Ted Adams) to keep quiet about his own gold strike, but he partly reveals the location to Morgan before he is killed by Brandon's henchmen, while en route to the recorder's office. Mary Cramer (Virginia Carroll) is informed by Johnny of her husband's murder. Their young son, Bud (Lanny Rees as Sonny Rees), has a letter from his father which indicates the strike to be under a peculiary-shaped rock. Brand kills himself when Johnny confronts him with the old wanted poster. Brandon's daughter, Marcia (Virginia Belmont), blames Johnny and in revenge reveals to the public that Cramer's strike is on Dead Man's Basin. Morgan order the wagon train destined for the gold area to be wiped out by his men posing as Indians, but Johnny and Dusty help Mary and Marcia excape. The strange rock and the gold aare discovered by Johnny, and Mary becomes a rich woman. Morgan is killed by Johnny in a gun fight, and he and Marcia make plans for their future happiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418981</url></doc>
