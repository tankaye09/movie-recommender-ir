<plot>Ria Singhania lives a wealthy lifestyle along with her husband, Amit, in a spacious bungalow. She runs a company, Spykar Jeans. One night she gets a call from the Police that her husband has been found dead, possibly murdered. She co-operates with the Police, who suspect her as she was having an affair with her subordinate, Siddharth Sardesai, who may have helped her kill Amit, who, in turn, was also having an affair with Sonia Sharma, who works for an ad agency run by Divakar. Ria meets with Aditya, who also works for the same ad agency, and is attracted to him, both get intimate, but Aditya, who is married to Neha, and has a school-going son, Arya, decides to break off this relationship much to the chagrin of Ria, who decides to teach Aditya a lesson - and she does this by acquiring the ad agency where Aditya works, and is all set to turn Aditya's life upside down. Aditya confronts her and returns home in a drunken state with blood on his clothes. Shortly thereafter Aditya is arrested by Police Inspector Kelly - and the charge is murder - that of Ria Singhania. A frantic Neha hires Advocate Milind Mehta - but will hiring a lawyer ensure the release of Aditya especially when the Police know that he had the motive and was possibly the last person to have been with Ria?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?189756</url></doc>
