<plot>Abe is obsessed with collecting eye wear. He carries several pairs with him at all times and in uncomfortable situations and encounters, he starts rapidly switching his glasses. Visiting his brother over a cup of coffee, Abe gets a new jacket as a present. Wearing this new jacket, Abe goes to the library and comes across the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. In this moment of awkwardness Abe reaches into his jacket to switch his classes, but since the jacket is new, it holds none of his eye wear. He drops the pair he was wearing in chock, and a guy passing by steps on them by accident. Abe is now left to face the situation with out his regular protective shield.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484472</url></doc>
