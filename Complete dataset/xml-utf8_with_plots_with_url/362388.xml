<plot>Arjun (JAYAM Ravi), an unemployed youngster and Deva (Rahul Dev) a powerful don both fall in love with Sailaja (Shriya), a middle-class beauty, at the same time on a rainy day at a railway station. Arjun keeps bumping into Sailaja coincidentally every time it rains. This makes them both feel that it is perhaps the rain that keeps bringing them together, and they start to fall in love. Deva, on the other hand, takes the back-door route to get the girl, with the help of her good-for-nothing father (Kalabhavan Mani). After learning of the Arjun and Sailaja's love, Deva and Sailaja's father work up devious plans to break them up. And finally they succeed in creating a rift between the two lovers. Though Arjun realizes what is really happening, Sailaja falls prey to the foils of the Deva and her father. The young lovers part ways; Sailaja becomes a leading lady in the movies and Arjun works with his uncle in a quarry as a demolition expert. Deva is cheated out of some money by Sailaja's father, and as revenge, he finds out where Sailaja now lives and kidnaps her from right under her parents' noses. Sailaja's father realizes that the only person who is daring enough and cares enough to get his daughter back is Arjun and goes to him with his pleas. It takes much convincing, but Arjun finally decides to rescue Sailaja but for reasons other than love. How successful is Arjun in rescuing Sailaja? Will Sailaja realize that Arjun was true in his love? Will they fall in love again?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362388</url></doc>
