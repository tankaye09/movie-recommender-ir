<plot>Assistant Commissioner of Police, Uday Dhirendra Thakur, is a rogue cop, known for his relentlessness in pursuing criminals, and bringing them to justice, failing which, killing them in false encounters. It is this reputation that gets him transferred to crime detection, and counseling at the hands of Dr. Mehak. Then a series of homicides take place, and the police feel that they are serial killings. Uday is assigned this case, and after a preliminary investigation, he knows that the suspect is author Avantika Suryavansh, as the killer is killing his victims in the same manner as described in her book "Inteqaam: The Perfect Game". Avantika is a poised, sophisticated, and intelligent young woman, and is not at all intimidated by Uday, and his persuasive methods. No previous information is available about Avantika, and her background cannot be verified. Then Uday comes to know that her mother was in an asylum for the insane, and when confronted Avantika loses her poise, and reveals a character that she may have been concealing from others, including herself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266723</url></doc>
