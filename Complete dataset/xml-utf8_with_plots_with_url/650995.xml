<plot>Dressed as a gentleman, Stanton is actually the leader of an outlaw gang. His men have rustled Art Weston's cattle and robbed the bank and are about to make their getaway. But Stanton is after Art's girlfriend and has gotten her to elope. Art intercepts her and the gang's wait for her arrival will give Art and the posse time to run them down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650995</url></doc>
