<plot>Trieu is an orphan who lives with her mother-in-law and her brother-in-law Thien. They work the family land, and also weave towels. Trieu's husband Dai returns to the village, after a four year absence, to ask Trieu for a divorce, because he has started a business in Hanoi with his girlfriend. Trieu refuses, but Dai leaves her ten pieces of gold and the divorce papers to sign. After a row with Toan, the local towel buyer, Trieu manages to sell the cloth to the distributors herself, and uses the gold to set up a weavers co-op. Trieu and Thien grow closer together, but village custom would disapprove of any relationship between the siblings-in-law, even if Trieu were divorced.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214544</url></doc>
