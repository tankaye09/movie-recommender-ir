<plot>These 5 Stories express the diverse meaning of love within the passage of time, and together they are a reflection of our aspiration for happiness. From youth to the old age of death, five love stories spread out. A ten year old girl, promising her competing admirers that she will choose one before she is twelve; a Russian doctor, who left his lover and emigrated to Israel, meets her unexpectedly again; the story of a French Kibbutz volunteer and a Kibbutz girl, who fall in love, separate, and meet up again twenty years later; a virtual romance between a religious settler and a secular, bubbly Mexican woman looking for a second chance; and the story of a 92 year old woman, who goes out to fulfill her dying husband's extraordinary last wish. The stories are mostly melodramatic, coming from a concrete social substance and shown in a quiet resourceful tone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?228195</url></doc>
