<plot>The story is centered in and around the ficticious mining town of Newby and the experiences of 2 sisters and their husbands during the strike of 1984/85. Michelle is married to Gary and Linda's husband is a local policeman. In the early days of the strike the men's respective jobs have little effect on them personally but following a violent incident in a local chip shop and the mobilization of outside police forces Gary and Paul's relationship becomes strained and the sisters also polarize. As the weeks turn to months and bitterness becomes the norm, things begin to change. While Michelle suddenly finds herself wanting to get more involved in the strike, Gary begins to wonder whether he shares his fellow picketers passion for the strike. Paul becomes more and more voluble in his opposition to the strike and Linda looks around her at the women of her community who have now found a voice and independence; the scene is set for an explosion both political and personal that will change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187911</url></doc>
