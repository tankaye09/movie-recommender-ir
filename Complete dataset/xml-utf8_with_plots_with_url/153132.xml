<plot>Notorious bandit Tantia Bheel is arrested by the Police, tried in Court, found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in jail, where he gets to meet Jailer Vijay Saxena. Shortly thereafter Tantia breaks out of jail, and re-joins his fellow-bandits, led by Bhairav Singh and his son, Jagga. Acknowledging his failure, Vijay tenders his resignation and vows to bring Tantia back to jail so that he can complete his sentence. Vijay does find Tantia and readies himself to apprehend him, but he must first overcome an unexpected opponent, in the shape and form of Shankar, who is out to avenge the death of his sister, Pammi, at the hands of Tantia. Watch what happens when both Vijay and Shankar clash with each other for Tantia - while the bandit remains at large.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153132</url></doc>
