<plot>The greatest series of sporting pictures ever attempted. It shows a stag hunt from start to finish. Beginning with the party starting away with the pack of hounds, numbering over 250, the tally ho proceeding down the road to the scene of the hunt, and the start from the village. It shows the chase of the stag over the hills and through the bogs, there being in the picture over 500 horsemen at one time. The effect is most startling as the hundreds of horsemen followed by the largest pack of hounds that was ever gotten together, dash over the hills and through the thick underbrush. The stag is finally cornered in a stream in the woods, closely pursued by the entire pack of hounds. The dogs finally close in on him and the death of the stag is shown. As he is dragged from the water, the entire body of hunters and dogs gather around, making a realistic and sensational closing to the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562436</url></doc>
