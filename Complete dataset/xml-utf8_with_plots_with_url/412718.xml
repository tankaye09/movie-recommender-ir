<plot>Travel to a remote village in the Caribbean, where a surprising number of people are born with extra fingers and toes. For some, "too many" is a source of amusement; for others a source of pain. For a teenager ashamed of her four extra fingers and toes, a surgeon's promise is a dream fulfilled. Follow her brave journey to America for the surgery she thought she'd never have. Half a world away, a girl with three legs spends her life hiding from ridicule until extreme surgery changes her life. And there's the exceptionally rare case that's a life or death dilemma: a baby born with an extra head. Her parents face a heartbreaking decision, to keep her as she is, or risk her life in an unprecedented operation. Finally, meet a boy for whom surgery is not the answer ? for him, five more fingers and toes is a blessing. These are the extraordinary stories of people living with ONE TOO MANY.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412718</url></doc>
