<plot>At 76, Lydia Durham is dying. An old stage performer, she lies in a bleak hospital room, falling in and out of consciousness. Her daughter Mandy comes to see her and finds a hidden photograph. It is the only personal artefact in the room. To Mandy, it is an image of shame and she becomes desperate to understand why her mother chose to have it by her deathbed. As Mandy dissects the image and the memory of the day it was taken, she comes to an acceptance of her mother. A woman with an incredible lust for life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431453</url></doc>
