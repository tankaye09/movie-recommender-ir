<plot>Subconsciously Harry derives a sense of serenity from his predictable, routine activities, and tends to develop emotional bonds with what &amp; whom he perceives to be permanent fixtures in his life. One day an unpredictable, random change to a part of his routine stirs up strong emotions in him, and sends him scurrying elsewhere in search of predictability and tranquility. There is a bit of Harry in every one of us. As the saying goes - No surprise is a good surprise!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108832</url></doc>
