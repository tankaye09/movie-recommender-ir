<plot>The Spice Power video is non-stop Girl Power attitude! You'll see for yourself how the fab five stormed the charts with their debut single, and went on to turn the pop world on its head with their own style of raunchy music in the form of a string of hits. Spice Power traces how they have come from being five unknown girls to take their thrones as the undisputed queens of pop with four consecutive number one singles under their belt. Jam packed with individual fact-files on Geri, Emma, Mel B, Victoria and Mel C, background information on the girls and a look at the individual Spice styles that have created a sensation. Spice Power is the ultimate expose of the pop phenomenon of the decade!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510208</url></doc>
