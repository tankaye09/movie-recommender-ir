<plot>We all have it. A junk drawer, a messy closet, a pile of mail, lids but no containers. A little clutter, a little bit of chaos. But what happens when that little bit of chaos becomes a big mess? You've got major clutter that is blocking your chances for success and happiness. And it's time to call in the NEAT team! NEAT is a dramatic makeover series that transforms interior spaces and people's lives as well. Host Hellen Buttigieg, is a professional organizer and life coach. She believes that now that we have everything what we really want is less of it. Her goal is to make space for what matters most. NEAT captures the humour and emotion of dealing with the inevitable clutter of our modern lives. Laughter, tears and solid takeaway information await the viewer of this light-hearted yet meaningful series that has its finger on the pulse of something that plagues us all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391953</url></doc>
