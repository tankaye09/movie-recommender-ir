<plot>Wally is having a tough time. He's broke, he's depressed, and he just found out that he's been fired from his job. Oh, and he's a giant lizard monster. When Jake (Jack Lance) tells Wally that he's no longer afraid of him, it's up to Wally's friend Chet, a rock-a-billy vampire, and the rest of his motley crew of ghouls to rally around their friend and try to bring him out of his slump. But, is Chet really looking out for Wally or does he have an agenda of his own? A tale of growing up, moving on, and what it really means to be scary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062085</url></doc>
