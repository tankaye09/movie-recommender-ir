<plot>LOW is a trio from Duluth, Minnesota, comprised of Alan Sparhawk, Mimi Parker and Zak Sally. The band has been stunning audiences with their mesmerizing harmonies and quiet intensity for over ten years. Director Sebastian Schrade joined the band on a string of live dates from Germany to the UK, as they toured in support of the album Trust. Told through van ride conversations, backstage banter, hotel room chats and late night revelations, LOW IN EUROPE is an illuminating portrait of a group making music at the height of its powers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346130</url></doc>
