<plot>"Taken in front of a country grocery store. The storekeeper has put out a sign: 'Nice Fresh Tomato Catsup for Sale.' A mischievous small boy by a quick change on the sign, causes it to read 'Nice Fresh Tomcats for Sale.' The small boy hides behind a barrel to await developments. Soon a country bumpkin strolls in, stands and laughs at the sign, and as he does so, the grocery keeper comes out. He at once jumps to the conclusion that the country bumpkin is responsible for the change in his sign, and proceeds to assault him, much to the amusement of the small boy behind the barrel."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037266</url></doc>
