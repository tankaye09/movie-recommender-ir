<plot>Tuli (Filipino for circumcise) is the story of Daisy and her life in an isolated Philippine Province. Daisy's father is responsible for the circumcision of almost all the Males in town. Daisy's father is also an abusive drunkard who abuses his wife and Daisy. Because of this Daisy creates a hatred towards her Father and Men. Daisy's father forces Daisy into a fixed marriage. Daisy doesn't want to marry the Man her Father chose for her. All the while Daisy's best friend is suffering herself. As is the tradition in this isolated Philippine town Daisy must follow in the footsteps of her Father and become the town's official circumciser. Daisy challenges the status quo and rebels against everything that she hates while a young Man defends her. Tuli is also the story of two best friends who deepen their relationship beyond friendship and a young Man willing to give Daisy everything he's got.
