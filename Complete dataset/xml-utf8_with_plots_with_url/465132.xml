<plot>Ruth and Ray, two drifting strangers, hook up and head to the West Coast in search of a better life. A trip full of fun, lust and a whole lot of risk spins out of control as they end up stuck in a roadside town with a bag full of cash, a psyhco drug dealer hunting them down, and one big double-cross waiting to happen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465132</url></doc>
