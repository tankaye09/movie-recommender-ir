<plot>An online machinima series, created using the World of Warcraft video game engine, MMOvie parodies dozens of popular films as it follows the comedic story of treasure-hunter Indiana Pwnz. On his adventure Indy is joined by his two companions, Bridget Pwnz, an impulsively vocal elf maiden, and Harnold, a dim-witted brute who speaks only in Arnold Schwarzenegger movie quotes. Together the three adventurers seek an ancient treasure, the Hallowed Artifact of Legend, in hopes that finding it will give them enough credibility to join the most elite guild of adventurers in the realms. On their journey, the heroic trio is followed by the villainous orc mastermind Nefario, his scheming troll intern An00bis, and his undead secretary Shelia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349192</url></doc>
