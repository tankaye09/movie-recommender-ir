<plot>An unfaithful husband comes home from work and discovers his wife has locked herself up in their bathroom. Unsure of what the problem is, he tries to communicate with his wife through the door and eventually threatens to open it. His wife responds to him not through speech, but by writing notes and placing them under the bathroom door. The husband reads the notes and discovers through them that his wife does indeed know about his infidelity. He pleads with her endlessly making every endeavor with words to coax his wife into leaving the bathroom. As hours toll away at the bathroom door, he soon realizes all too late that he may not be ready for what will confront him once the door is opened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185827</url></doc>
