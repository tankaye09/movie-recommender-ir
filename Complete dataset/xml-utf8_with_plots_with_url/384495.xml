<plot>My Mother's Journey demonstrates how change can take place through the dedicated efforts of individual community members. The film documents a critical piece of American history, and shows how far the nation has come in addressing issues of poverty, while at the same time, raises awareness of the many circumstances and statistics that have not changed. The story is intended to motivate community members to continue to reinvest in the tradition of addressing important issues of social change and justice.Inspired and invigorated by Rochester's tradition of progressive community dialogue and action, My Mother's Journey can be a catalyst for dialogue on building greater social capital. The film is designed as a tool to improve insight into issues surrounding poverty, race and class. The film addresses these issues in a deeply honest way, aiming to influence a shift in peer attitudes and foster respect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384495</url></doc>
