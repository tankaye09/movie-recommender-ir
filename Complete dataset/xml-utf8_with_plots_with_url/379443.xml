<plot>Cultural boundries dissolve, and the family of a man struggle to reinvent itself within a new cultural context. Mr. Ahmed is the story of such a conflict - the old and new world: India and America. This simple, yet poignant drama, paints a portrait of a man caught between two worlds. As memories of a home and family left behind seep to the surface, the collision of the old and new world forces his life into a critical turn, and an act, which could destroy both of them. "an enigmatic masterpiece" (The Times of India)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379443</url></doc>
