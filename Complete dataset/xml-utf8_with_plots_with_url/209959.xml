<plot>There's Jacob Manansala, a man with a firm desire to claim what's rightfully his. He's willing to fight tooth and nail for the riches taken from his father. Then, a mother named Viola Ojeda goes all out to achieve her hard-fought dreams. She selfishly chose to abandon her child for a more comfortable and properous life. Kevin Rodrigueez is the son who wickedly schemes for power and wealth. His ambitious ploys for prestige will drive him to fiendish revenge. Meanwhile, Viola's assistant/protégé Eloisa conspires with Jacob to plan her boss's downfall. While the plastic surgeon girlfriend of Kevin named Janelle supports all his plans.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209959</url></doc>
