<plot>Avner, a 30-year old policeman, lives with his elderly grandmother. She is cared for by Noi, an illegal immigrant, with whom Avner is having a clandestine affair. His partner, Nathan, finds out about it. The affair and its having been kept a secret drive him to alienate the two. Once Avner realizes he can no longer remain oblivious to reactions of people around him, he begins to seriously examine his true and sincere feelings. He is forced to confront an unexpected reality. Ultimately, Avner, who had believed in a formula that would reconcile between opposites, finds himself deprived of virtually everything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?098986</url></doc>
