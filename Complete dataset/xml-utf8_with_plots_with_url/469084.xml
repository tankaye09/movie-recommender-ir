<plot>In December 1998, Mark Dallagher was convicted of the murder of 94-year-old Dorothy Wood in Huddersfield. The prosecution's case was based on evidence found at the scene - a print said to have been made by Dallager's ear. When 94-year-old Dorothy Wood was murdered, the only real clue was a print said to have been made by the murderer's ear as he'd listened at her window. Experts said that ear prints were like fingerprints, telling the jury that Mark Dallagher's ear print matched that on Dorothy's window. Mark thus became the first person in Britain to be gaoled on the evidence of an ear print. Mark spent seven years in prison before tests proved that the DNA on the ear print belonged to someone other than Mark. The police have since refused to reopen the inquiry. The BBC was given access to film and interview Mark in gaol, the first time a serving prisoner has been interviewed alleging a miscarriage of justice in Britain, and to the defense and prosecution teams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469084</url></doc>
