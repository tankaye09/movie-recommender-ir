<plot>Gina and Kevin are the perfect match. The two are deeply in love with each other and on the same page with many things including their opposition to marriage. Afraid that marriage will ruin her relationship as it has done to her parents' marriage, Gina has vowed never to marry. After being pressured into marriage with the mother of his two sons, Kevin has vowed never to marry again. But when Gina's co-worker, Lenny, invites her to his church, as he routinely does each Friday, odd occurrences happen that will lead her to a powerful message. Questions are answered that she has secretly had in her heart but ignored. Now seeing her relationship with Kevin in a new light, she has a decision to make. Does she walk away from all that she and Kevin have built or does she ignore the new love that she has found in another?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009570</url></doc>
