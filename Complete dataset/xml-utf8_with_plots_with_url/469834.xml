<plot>Two hoboes appear as a Rube approaches. The latter sees a weighing machine and decides to weigh himself. Pulling a long bag from his pocket he makes a dive for a nickel and drops it in the slot, and at the same time jumps on the machine, which in turn throws him up in the air out of sight. The hoboes make a dive for the coin bag which he drops in his sudden ascent and disappear also. A sure hit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469834</url></doc>
