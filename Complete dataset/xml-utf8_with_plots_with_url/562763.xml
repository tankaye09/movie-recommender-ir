<plot>Set on the storied streets of South Boston, The Greening of Southie is a feature documentary about Boston's first residential green building, and the skeptical workers who are asked to build it. From wheatboard cabinetry to recycled steel, bamboo flooring to dual-flush toilets, The Macallen Building is something different--a leader in the emerging field of environmentally friendly design. But Boston's steel-toed union workers aren't sure they like it. And when things on the building start to go wrong, the young developer has to keep the project from unraveling.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562763</url></doc>
