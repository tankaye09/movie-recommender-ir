<plot>Two doctors, a father and son (Edward Asner, Gary Cole), conceal their alcohol and drug problems in this potent look at the abuse of those substances that exist in the medical profession. Asner portrays a well-thought of surgeon who over-indulges in alcohol. His son, who follows in his father's footsteps, has become addicted to morphine and amphetamines. Unlike his father, he completely hides his usage, even from his own wife (Kate McNeil). When his father's over-indulgence becomes apparent, the son moves back home to help his father's practice. After the father almost kills a bicyclist in a drunken driving incident, the son confronts the father. But the father has also learned of the son's addiction. Neither will admit their need for help and ultimately leads to tragic consequences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?642058</url></doc>
