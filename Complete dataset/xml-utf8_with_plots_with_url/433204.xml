<plot>Ping Shao Han: Ascension is an impressive, 21st-century throwback to the good old days of mythical gods and old school kung fu as seen in many martial arts films from Hong Kong and particularly Taiwan during the '70s. Unlike some short films that struggle to combine clich√©d dialogue and stunt work, Ascension shuts up and delivers the action, and without resorting to parody. Co-writer, director and action choreographer Lon Beyer is Ping, your typical martial arts-lovin' everyman who crosses paths with a martial beauty on the streets of Anytown, USA. Dressed in period Chinese garb, her name is Pay Ying (co-writer and producer Elle Beyer) and she's in a hurry for you see, she has a date to catch. But this is no ordinary date for Pay Ling is the daughter of the mythical Emperor God and her cherished companion she is to meet is none other than the Monkey King of Journey to the West fame. After a misunderstanding results in a brief duel between Ping and Pay Ling, he follows her to a rooftop where Su Wu-kung (Harry Hsu), the Monkey King in human form awaits. A battle of wills that began in heaven between the two gods continues on Earth with Ping siding with the girl he has just met.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433204</url></doc>
