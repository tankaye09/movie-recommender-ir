<plot>Four people from the same family leave home to seek consolation at the bar. Byong-hwan, while very drunk, goes outside to relieve himself on the side of the truck, and is consequently hit by the very same truck. His family is now hard pressed to come up with the necessary funds for medical treatment, with Jong-lim resorting to prayer; which they believe is responsible for the insurance company granting them $400. With the family now feeling inspired, they are encouraged to better their current situations with hard work. They then reform and start a new business, which makes them more crazy as they make more money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?228382</url></doc>
