<plot>Each season fashion designers desperately search for the next big thing. In many cases, they turn to the past for inspiration -- Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Doloris Del Rio, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Marlena Dietrich -- their legacies still haunt the runways. Everything we wear is grounded in a bit of history. But you can't wear history or can you? Take a walk with us down Madison Avenue and count the pairs of Jackie O' sunglasses, bellbottom pants and polyester pullovers. Tune into the "Today Show" to get a glimpse of Katie Couric's flashback-to-the-'50s in those classic twinsets.
