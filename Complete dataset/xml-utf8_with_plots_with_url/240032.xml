<plot>When investment banker BOB comes over to meet his graphic artist girlfriend, JADE's old art friends from NYU- 'The Hipsters', all hell breaks loose. Literally. In HIPSTER TREATMENT, a comedy of bad manners, first impressions mean a lot. Bob's polite, interested questions reveal Jade's seemingly talented, brilliantly 'creative' friends to be incestuous, lazy, trust-fund wannabes that don't actually do anything. When the TV reveals a riot of out of work Wall Street bankers- the so called 'living dead'- turning into a full fledged Zombie massacre, only Bob and Jade seem the least bit concerned. Bob futilely barricades the door in an attempt to save himself, and the Hipsters. Meanwhile, our Hipsters have no time to be concerned about their impending doom by the hands of the Zombie masses, and Bob eventually tires of trying to save them. And so, Bob is left with just one choice- The Hipsters or the zombies?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?240032</url></doc>
