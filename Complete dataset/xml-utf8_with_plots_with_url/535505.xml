<plot>Yuusuke as a shy, unassuming high school student whose father has gone abroad and left him alone at home for the first time in his life. He doesn't suspect how much his life is going to change -- on his way to school he stumbles upon a naked girl, with a halo over her head, sleeping in the forest. She wakes up and proclaims that he's her husband. He runs away but can't escape -- she's the new student in his class, and her family of Munster look-a-likes have moved into his house. After overhearing him declare to his unresponsive crush that she's like an angel to him, Noelle (the girl with the halo) declares that she's going to become an angel for her Yuusuke. There's a villain in the underworld who wants to make sure she never becomes an angel -- she has the halo and just needs to sprout the wings -- but the villain's agenda is not revealed until later in the series. Sugary-cute and excessively pink, the series starts of extremely cute but becomes darker and more twisted at the end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?535505</url></doc>
