<plot>Maxine decides to sever a long-term relationship and take a job as a house sitter, only to discover she has become the object of her new female employer's sexual desire. As Maxine resists these new advances, she becomes even further despondent and withdrawn. She decides to paint a portrait of a doll that she finds in the basement. Maxine becomes obsessed with the doll, and her identity gradually disintegrates as the portrait nears completion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154590</url></doc>
