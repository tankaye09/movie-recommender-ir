<plot>A small Italian husband kisses his tall, fat wife goodbye as their children look on. He's immigrating to America, land of opportunity. But he misses his wife terribly. He sits on a bench at Coney Island, bawling and kissing his wife's picture. But a sexy shimmy dancer soon takes his mind off her. He makes overtures to her until the stern look of a policeman cools his ardor. But wait, that's no policeman: he's only a wax dummy. The Italian sees another policeman, but, assuming he's another dummy, kicks him in the shin. Too bad this policeman is real. He gives chase. The Italian manages to lose him, ending up in a big tent where a hootchy-kootchy dancer is performing. The dancer is his wife. Later, the audience is invited to follow the bouncing ball and sing along to "Mariutch Down at Coney Island."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?358604</url></doc>
