<plot>Is it a legend, or a myth??? The one question has plagued mankind throughout the ages has always remained, but finally comes to unfold here in a new chilling Thriller. The Native American Indians thought it was fact... they respected, feared it and Believed to be a GOD. Ten Years ago, there was a "Ghost-like something" seen killing people in the dark unforgiving woods as people were culled away one by one and some never to be found. What really happened? This year reports have surfaced that it was all just a "Hoax"... But a local philanthropist believes different and puts a $2.5 Million Dollar Bounty on this "Beast" in the woods and a team of expert hunters go out looking for the "Silent Killer." But now years later it was never to be found and they dismissed it as an unsolved mystery! When BARBARA SANDERS and her free spirited college friends venture off into the deep woods of the Northeastern Valley Mountains to look for this so called legend and for a weekend retreat, their camping and canoeing trip fun turns into FEAR in the FOREST and a dangerous roller coaster adventure ride when they each encounter the unspeakable terror! Now it's a serious struggle against Man Vs Beast in which there can only be one in the end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191413</url></doc>
