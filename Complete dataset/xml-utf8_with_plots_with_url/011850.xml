<plot>Shows the old familiar game, "Hoist the Sail," played on an unsuspecting Grandma. Grandma is seated in a big chair, with her six charming granddaughters gathered about her. They stand over Grandma counting up to six, when up goes Grandma into the air. Suddenly they let go their hold and down comes Grandma. Grandma retaliates by seizing one of her granddaughters and giving her a sound spanking. Very humorous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011850</url></doc>
