<plot>Horatio Nelson was born on September 29th, 1758, into a fairly poor but genteel family in the quiet backwaters of Norfolk. From his unassuming background, he rose through the ranks of the British navy, eventually becoming Admiral and a viscount, and one of Britian's greatest heroes. His name is synonymous with warfare at sea, as he established himself as the greatest tactician of the waters, victorious in virtually every encounter, culminating in his victory over Admiral Villeneuve at the Battle of Trafalgar.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327683</url></doc>
