<plot>Italian Soldiers (Spaghetti Requiem) is a portrait of a youthful and exceptional adventure which unfolds during an unforgettable summer. We are behind the scenes of CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN by John Madden ('Shakespeare in Love') - starring Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz: a bunch of Italian actors singing, cooking and charming the entire set, and a historical background both unknown and shocking. A dark page in the second world war.The young actors feel happy and very fortunate but gradually become increasingly aware that essentially they have been hired to play a general chorus which leaves little room for any individual expression of their talent. And more, they are constantly asked to play the stereotyped italian clichè, which is not so distant from reality. Intensive rehearsals include singing, dancing and military training. They are constantly in each other's company, on and off the set and are accomodated in a hotel which quickly takes on a family atmosphere. The entire experience provides them, in equal measure, with constant gratification and frustration at every turn, unbridled fun and profound sadness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270755</url></doc>
