<plot>Cubans form a warm nation that sticks together, and are more than any others, a people filled with an incredible pride. Cubans are proud of their Revolution and of their country. But every day, thousands of citizens of Havana somehow manage to retain the guides of socialism and yet do everything to chase the American dollar, very perilous, surrealist and humiliating. While taking about their daily life, their dreams and their ambitions, they tells us about the reasons why they depend on the American dollar. How can one balance a budget in a country where a doctor earns less than 20 American dollars a month? For all those Cubans that juggle between staying and leaving towards a better future, how do they live on that land, two steps away from the United States?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252164</url></doc>
