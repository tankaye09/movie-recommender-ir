<plot>As in the previous incarnations, the 1980 version of "To Tell the Truth" featured a team of three contestants one the actual person associated with a story and two imposters. After the affidavit is read, the celebrity panelists question the three contestants in an attempt to ferret out the liars. The celebrities then voted separately as to who they thought was the real person associated with the story. Payoffs were based on the team's ability to fool the panel $100 per incorrect vote and $1,000 for four incorrect votes. Two such games were played per show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?610027</url></doc>
