<plot>As though torn from today's headlines 'Pricks' brings to life a contemporary urban legend and melds it with the genre of reality entertainment. 'Pricks' pushes the boundary of how far media driven projects should venture in an attempt to satisfy an audiences hunger. This 10 minute short evokes both hatred and admiration for it's central characters. Upon completion one is compelled to view it again in order to balance their emotional attachment to the transpired events. 'Pricks' delves headlong into a topic that crosses the comfort barrier of the audience. It has the potential to generate controversy and will at the very least, get under the skin of individuals who are unsure how they would react should they be placed in similar circumstances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?443303</url></doc>
