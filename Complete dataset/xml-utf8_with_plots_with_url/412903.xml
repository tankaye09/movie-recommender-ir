<plot>The death penalty has been abolished and the punishment for murder, however slight, is life in prison. These two factors lead to a problem: prison over-population. A solution is needed... Prisoners in groups of nine are taken to an off-shore facility and locked in a room. There, supervised by an enigmatic Director and his brutish Assistant, the nine are forced to participate in a game that will reward the last one standing with a full government pardon. The stakes are high and the reward great. But does the end justify the means? Only one will find out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412903</url></doc>
