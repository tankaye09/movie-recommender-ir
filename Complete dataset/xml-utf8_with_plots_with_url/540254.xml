<plot>Andy Griffith, Ron Howard, Rodney Dillard, Don Knotts sat in their court room set where the show was made. They talked about the show and how the show affected their lives and how others react to them when they see them now. Archive footage was shown of their favorite moments and of those who had died that were part of the show. Ron Howard walked with Andy Griffith on the road that opened the show. Ron, at age 49 whistled the theme song and threw the rock just as he did as a little boy, and comparative footage was shown. After they finished talking they all hugged and told they loved one another. Andy Griffith turned the lights out and the show ended.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540254</url></doc>
