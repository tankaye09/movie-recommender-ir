<plot>'I Am The Bluebird' is the story of Ethan Galloway, a young man recovering from surgery with temporary memory loss. As he re-enters his life, his past slowly becomes familiar, though not without a few changes - his neurologist father, Charles, is remarried; his mother, Jill, has become an alcoholic; and his younger sister, Ally, is dating his childhood friend Luke. As Ethan gets used to his new life, he receives a picture of himself with a beautiful girl on the beach - a forgotten memory - one that never came back. Confused, Ethan attempts to look deeper, but is constantly kept from the truth by his family's own dysfunctional problems. He finds nothing but inconclusive evidence and dead ends, until he runs into Camille, the girl in the picture. As their relationship grows, he becomes paranoid of the people around him whom he once trusted, and one by one, discovers the lies that have kept him from remembering the haunting event that brought him to the experimental surgery that was performed on him by his own father. As Ethan becomes further entangled in his search for the truth, he realizes that not everything is what it seems, and that his surgery may very well have been a cover-up for a condition that no one wants him to know he has. Beginning as a simple quest to uncover one's haunted past, "I Am The Bluebird" takes you on an emotional journey to find the true meaning of happiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252036</url></doc>
