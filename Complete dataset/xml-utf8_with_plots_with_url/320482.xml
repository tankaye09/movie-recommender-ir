<plot>Harvey Harris is an author and his latest novel has been universally rejected. He is feeling more distanced than ever from the world and everyone that surrounds him. A desperate move leads him to sneaking into the very funerals he writes about as a bizarre form of self-help therapy, gaining temporary love and acceptance from those people who are at their most vulnerable and self-less state of mind. The death of Harvey's mother, coupled with a chance meeting of a strong-willed woman named Mona, will force Harvey to confront his greatest fears about loss and rejection and how to find a way to connect through the most severe forms of disconnection.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320482</url></doc>
