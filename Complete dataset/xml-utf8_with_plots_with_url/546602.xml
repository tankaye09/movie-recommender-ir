<plot>This is a very humorous picture in two continuous scenes. The first shows a bedroom, where an elderly couple have retired for the night. The burglar enters cautiously through a window and is heard by the wife, who awakens the husband. He (the husband) is about paralyzed with fright, but his wife persuades him to get up, and the two proceed to hunt for the burglar. The latter in the meantime has made his way into an adjoining room, where the couple come armed with a revolver, and in great trepidation try to locate the thief. They finally discover him in the closet, and the husband makes the wife stand guard while he goes out for a policeman. When the officer enters and captures the burglar a funny climax is given by the husband suddenly assuming an attitude of great courage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546602</url></doc>
