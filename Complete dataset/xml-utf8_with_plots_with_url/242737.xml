<plot>Several farmers are discussing politics in a country grocery store. A bunco man enters and takes an electric battery from a bag. He induces the Rubes to join hands and take hold of the handles. The current is turned on and they go through some very funny stunts, while the bunco man goes through their pockets, taps the till, and makes a hasty exit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?242737</url></doc>
