<plot>This is the street parade of the great Indian Scout, Col. Cody, better and more familiarly known as Buffalo Bill. The entire aggregation is seen on parade accompanied by the wild animals they have secured during their journeys around the world, and presents an interesting spectacle. Everybody loves to see the street parade when the circus comes to town, but this is decidedly more interesting than a circus parade.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085774</url></doc>
