<plot>Reena lives a very wealthy lifestyle with her businessman dad, socialite mom, and widower paternal grandfather in a mansion. She studies in college, is very bored, and joins protesting students who are agitating against rising college fees. She has a crush on their family doctor, Samar Chowdhary. She goes on a date with him to a club and falls for the club's singer, Sharad, who rejects her. Still bored, she gets friendly with Kitty, who in turn introduces her to Rana, and from thence on Reena gets hooked on drugs and starts coming home late at night. Her grandfather notices this and tells her dad, who in turn confronts her, and convinces her to get married to Samar. The marriage does take place but Reena is unable to keep away from drugs, and refuses any treatment. She gets pregnant and is hospitalized. Her parents who have been away, return home several months later to view their grandchild little realizing the horror that awaits them and that soon their daughter will be arrested by the Police, and may face the gallows for shooting a man to death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391598</url></doc>
