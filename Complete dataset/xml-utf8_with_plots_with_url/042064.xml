<plot>There is no way to make this pretty, it is a dirty and difficult life living on the street. "Another Man's Treasure" is a look at a world that most of us would rather not see. But whether we see it or not, it is there, people living off of what the rest of us throw away. What may be trash to some is a means of survival to others. This documentary short shows what some are doing to get by in America today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042064</url></doc>
