<plot>As the Colonel is getting ready to go to sleep, his wife reproaches him for having eaten rarebit, which always gives him strange dreams. Sure enough, the Colonel soon has a dream, in which his wife takes in an odd stray animal. In his dream, the new pet has an insatiable appetite - but what really causes trouble is that every time it eats something, it immediately gets larger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159702</url></doc>
