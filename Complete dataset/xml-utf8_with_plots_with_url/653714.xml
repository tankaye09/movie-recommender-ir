<plot>An imaginative 8 year old boy, Delroy Kincaid, is raised in a seaside Caribbean fishing village by his grandmother who teaches him to draw and paint. Then when Delroy's parents 'send for him' to live with them in North America Delroy and his grandmother immigrate. After his grandmother dies soon after the journey, an alienated Delroy begins to notice that many of the white children in the neighborhood go away to the outdoors for the holidays while the other black children in the inner city never travel anywhere. One winter Delroy's artistic imagination comes alive and takes him on a journey in which he tries to come to place with the death of his grandmother and his life in the reality of this new foreign land.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653714</url></doc>
