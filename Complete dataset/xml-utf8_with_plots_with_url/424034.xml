<plot>A revealing urban portrait of a local park and the rich assortment of characters who spend time there or just pass through. This documentary, made over five years, gains the trust of it's subjects and offers a unique insight into one of London's lesser known green areas. In an age when entertainment and documentary are often difficult to distinguish it is refreshing to find a non-fiction project that approaches its subject with intelligence and integrity. The film looks at the little things that can help us all to make our own judgments and see the bigger picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424034</url></doc>
