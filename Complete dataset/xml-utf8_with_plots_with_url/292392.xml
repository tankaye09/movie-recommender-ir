<plot>On the occasion of the visit of King Edward and Queen Alexandra in London our camera occupied a most advantageous position on the Strand, London, and we show an excellent portrait of the King and Queen seated in their carriage drawn by eight cream colored horses. They are accompanied by Field Marshall Lord Roberts and staff and the Imperial Yeomanry, mounted cavalry, etc.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292392</url></doc>
