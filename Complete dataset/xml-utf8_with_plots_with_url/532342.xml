<plot>In an attempt to regain her beauty queen status, Darlene leaves her small southern town after the death of her husband. She arrives in LA to discover she is too old, and too late. With no other means of support, she resorts to taxi dancing for 75 cents a dance. With all her hope and dreams dashed, she learns what it means to survive as an independent woman, far from the southern traditions she'd known her entire life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?532342</url></doc>
