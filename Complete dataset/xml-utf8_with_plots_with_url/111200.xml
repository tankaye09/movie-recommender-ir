<plot>Tony Kenny's "Columbarium" is a film set in the head of a disembodied, warped and mute poet embarking on an elliptical and interminable perambulation of Dublin. Concerned with the nature of perceived duality, consciousness and conscience, it is a subjective examination of mans compulsive mind; a meditation on the nature of addiction, escapism, grief, hallucination and acceptance: obsessively wrapped up as a long form visual love poem with lots of birds, bees and biplanes. Jury Prize Winner at Darklight Festival Dublin 2006 contact: tonyk@ireland.com Tony Kenny is an artist and filmmaker. In 1996 his interactive digital artwork 'Shoplifting' was acquired by the Glasgow Museum of Modern Art for permanent exhibition. In 1990 he was awarded the special jury prize at the Hamburg International Short Film Festival for his film 'Cogito Ergo Phuq'. 'Columbarium' was commissioned by the Arts Council of Ireland in 2004.
