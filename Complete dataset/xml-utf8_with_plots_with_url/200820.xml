<plot>'Forgotten New York: Collect Pond' is the first episode of a series of short documentaries that explores the history of New York City. In this episode we examine Collect Pond. The Pond used to exist in lower Manhattan until it became polluted and was filled in with dirt during the early 1800s. Buildings and streets were erected in it's place and the neighborhood became the infamous Five Points. Our documentary deals with the history of the pond and it's site as well as what evidence we could find of the pond today in Manhattan's concrete jungle. For example, Manhattan's Canal Street used to really be a canal. It was built over a natural stream that drained Collect Pond. The story of Collect Pond is told with old drawings, historian interviews, and footage of what the original environment of New York City used to look like.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200820</url></doc>
