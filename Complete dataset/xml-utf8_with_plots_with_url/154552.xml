<plot>It's the story of a mother-in-law who thinks the Indian daughter-in-law is not as good as her counterpart in the USA - the Dollar Bahu (played by Chandni Toor) who lives in the golden land. The mother-in-law craves to be with her son in America and later when she herself spends a year there, she realizes that the problems most Indian-Americans face in the USA are similar to those back home and that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Dollar Bahu will also give insight about the large, prominent and growing South Asian community in the USA. The serial shows the struggle of Indian immigrants in the USA and the clash of both cultures; one inherent and Indian, the other alien and American. If the serial gets permission to shoot in Pakistan later, it will be the first serial to be shot in India, America and Pakistan. Dollar Bahu stars Himani Shivpuri, Rakesh Pandey, Mayoori Kango, Chandni Toor, Ismael Bashi, Kunika, Deepak Parashar etc. in prominent roles</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154552</url></doc>
