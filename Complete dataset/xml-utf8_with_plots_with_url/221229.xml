<plot>A great series of pictures taken on the parade grounds at West Point on graduating day, the day President Roosevelt decorated Cadet Titus with a medal as a reward for being the first United States soldier to go over the wall at Pekin. The picture shows the entire command of cadets marching upon the great parade grounds and being reviewed by President Roosevelt. The marching is superb. The cadets are finally drawn up in line in front of the President, and Cadet Titus is called out to receive his medal, which President Roosevelt personally pins on the cadet's breast, amid the great cheering of the people in the reviewing stand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221229</url></doc>
