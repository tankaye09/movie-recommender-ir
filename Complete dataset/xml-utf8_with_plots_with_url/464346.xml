<plot>Award-winning documentary film-maker, Tara Veneruso's newest project, RISK: At-Risk Girls Behind the Camera, launches into production this June in Kansas City and St. Joseph Missouri. She will explore the question, "What are the pressures of being a teenage girl today?" Ms. Veneruso's look at teenage girls participating in a summer film-making program will observe girls from different races, cultures, and socio-economic conditions from the Kansas City and St. Joseph areas as they create movies that tell their own personal stories. The audience we will get to watch the students learn how to tell their stories on film through workshops with Ms. Veneruso and her colleagues, such as John Serpentelli who specializes at working with at-risk youth through his company Animation Stewdio, whose work has been featured and commissioned by HBO Kids, Nickelodeon, and the up-coming Discovery Kids Network. Risk, a new film, in the style of popular documentaries such as Mad Hot Ballroom, Our Town, and Spellbound further describes the difficulties and woes of being a teen in today's society. The film will also include Veneruso's personal journey to becoming a film director despite being an at-risk girl herself. "A single teacher reached out to me when I was 15 and taught me it was fantastic that I was different and that I could make a positive difference in the world regardless of the negative and horrible things I had experienced in my life. This film will capture this experience with a new group of girls and hopefully encourage the audience to reach out to teenagers who need our support and guidance." Production Dates: production for Risk: At-Risk Girls Behind the Camera begins June 11th, 2007 and will complete principal photography July 10th, 2007. The film will be released in early 2008.
