<plot>The Hobbit Enigma examines one of the greatest controversies in science today: just what did scientists really find when they uncovered the tiny, human-like skeleton of a strange creature on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003? Since the discovery was made public a bitter dispute has split the world of anthropology. Are the bones a previously unknown and bizarre primitive species of human? The Hobbit discovery forces us to rethink some of the most fundamental questions of human origins. How could the Hobbits have survived for so long and until so recently? Who were its ancestors? Is it possible that human origins are to be found in Asia, not Africa?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564665</url></doc>
