<plot>Dr. Marcus Ryan is a brilliant physicist specializing in multi-dimensional quantum mechanics. His life is his work until the day his wife and daughter are killed in a tragic accident. Devastated, Marcus sinks into the blackness of alcoholism and depression. One night, wrought with anger and despair, Marcus decides to kill himself and jumps from the roof of an eight-story building. But he lives. Somewhere in between him hitting the pavement and his comatose state in the hospital, Marcus sees blue-prints and schematics of a mysterious machine flashing before his eyes. He comes to the conclusion that he survived his suicide attempt because he was meant to build this machine. Willing himself out of the hospital, Marcus spends the next 6 months in rehabilitation learning to walk again. He shuts himself in his house and spends 3 years building the machine he sees in his head. What he thinks is an infinite energy machine, a machine that will give free, pure, clean and limitless energy to the world, becomes something much more. It becomes a conscious entity that helps Marcus overcome the pain and loss of his family and transforms his life and all those around him for the better.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?588878</url></doc>
