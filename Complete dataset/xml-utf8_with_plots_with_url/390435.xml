<plot>14-year-old Natalie, with her geeky glasses and uniform and her unflattering hairdo, arrives home from school on a Friday afternoon to find a list of chores waiting for her, including checking on her Nana down the street. She rushes through the list, creating chaos in the process, so that she can transform herself with makeup, trendy clothes and big hair into the dancing queen she feels inside. Mom arrives home and isn't too happy with what she sees, but she finds a unique way to deal with her spirited teen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390435</url></doc>
