<plot>Truck-driver Dharam Singh lives a middle-classed lifestyle along with wife, Banto, and son, Raja. He adopts an orphan, Veer Singh. When his brother, Kaalia, returns after being discharged from jail, he asks him to leave. Then he turns in some smugglers, who are arrested and imprisoned. But their boss, Mangal Singh, confronts Dharam, and ends up killing both Dharam and his wife. With the police hot on his tail, Mangal disappears, leaving Veera to bring up Raja with the help of Mehar, their neighbor. Years later, Veera and Raja have grown up with Veera looking after the trucking business, and Raja studying in college. The Police have been unable to even locate Mangal Singh. Veera would like to avenge his foster father's brutal killing, but before he could do so, Kaalia re-enters their lives, instigates Raja against Veera. As a result Raja accuses Veera of theft and asks him to leave. The question does remain: Will Veera and Raja ever reconcile? What exactly was Kaalia's motive in separating Veera and Raja? And where exactly is Mangal Singh?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?387500</url></doc>
