<plot>If Turner Classic Movies has this one in their Shorts vault, it will hopefully stay there. There is a xylophonist who plays with his feet as well as his hands; a tap-dancer who plays the piano to accompany himself (well, that is worth-while viewing), and a musical horn soloist mingled in with hillbilly and Mexican singers. Music played includes "Die Fledermaus Waltz", "Nola", "Sweet Sue" and "Dinah."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382491</url></doc>
