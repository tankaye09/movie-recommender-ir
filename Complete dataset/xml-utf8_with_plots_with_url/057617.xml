<plot>August 2005, Israel is about to withdraw from Gaza. This year is also a turning point for Daniel and Elad. Both are joining the army. They are only 18, yet they are convinced that they chose the right way. Daniel is willing to sacrifice his freedom and Elad his life. Will they succeed to achieve their goals? And who will be accountable if they fail? The film deals with choices that never before confronted the young Israelis. This is a story of a divided country and its children who are searching for a way, of big dreams and small dreams, of people and land, and parents who are afraid for their sons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057617</url></doc>
