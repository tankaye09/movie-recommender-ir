<plot>Elaine Shiver, having witnessed her own mother's life of domestic oppression, resists the accepted convictions that had been forced upon women into the 1960s and wants to travel a different path. Her world is changing and it has been profoundly influenced by Alan Shepard's recent historic flight into space. Through a series of events, Elaine finds herself engaged in a project with Jimmy, a middle school-aged neighbor, who is struggling to complete an assignment for his science class. As she offers help and encouragement to her young friend, Elaine must overcome criticism of her own ambitions by her mother and an overbearing and very traditional teacher, who are convinced that a woman's place is in the home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060278</url></doc>
