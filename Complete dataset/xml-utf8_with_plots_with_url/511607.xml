<plot>On a tree-lined suburban street in what is probably the San Fernando Valley, Elaine is doing some serious spring cleaning, filling and carrying boxes to the curb while her slothful husband Al sits in front of a large TV napping and eating chips and Cheetos. Seeing the tool box in the laundry room seems to give Elaine an idea, but her thoughts are interrupted by her neighbors, June and Ward, who carry on lovingly under her window. Does Elaine's idea lead to action?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511607</url></doc>
