<plot>This sports comedy features two brothers from Youngstown, Ohio. One is a lifelong Steelers fan, the other a lifelong Browns fan. They're lives and careers mirror the successes and failures of each team. The Steelers fan, the older brother, is a successful businessman. The Browns fan is a down on his luck, sad sack loser career wise, and in personal relationships. The movie chronicles the younger brother as he becomes so distraught when the Browns announce they are moving to Baltimore, that he orchestrates an elaborate, hysterical assassination attempt on Browns owner Art Modell. He is hospitalized, and we follow his treatment for depression from inpatient psychiatry, to more outside of the box treatments (a sex therapist). Treatment for depression is satirized, along with pharmaceutical companies, and modern psychiatry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233581</url></doc>
