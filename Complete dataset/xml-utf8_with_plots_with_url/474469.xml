<plot>Raju and Guddi are childhood friends and neighbors, who are virtually inseparable. They separate tragically, after Raju's dad is arrested after a dramatic police chase for break, enter, and theft. Guddi grows up to become a professional stage singer and dancer, while Raju grows up to be a card-sharp and a thief. Years later both Raju and Guddi meet each, but now Guddi is called Seema, and Raju is called Chander, their real names, both fall in love with each other, without knowing they are childhood friends. While Seema is on her way to her birthplace for religious reasons, Chander too is headed that way, not for religious reasons, but to get himself arrested so that he can be jailed - for a motive that will get him a hefty sum of money from a gangster.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474469</url></doc>
