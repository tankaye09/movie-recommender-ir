<plot>A group of soldiers out on maneuvers is having a conversation about "triggers" that cause people to want a cigarette. The discussion segways into an urban/military legend about a soldier who is trained from birth to snap out of a seemingly normal existence and into a lethal killing machine when someone utters the "trigger" word. The film takes the audience into a visual story of this soldier, whose romantic day in the country with his beautiful wife is brutally interrupted by a group of thugs who kidnap, rape and kill his wife. But as she is dying, she whispers the something into her frantic soldier's ear that causes a chain reaction of events that leaves the rednecks in a heap of gore...except for the killer, who gets away unseen. But is the "legend" actually true?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?618054</url></doc>
