<plot>Legendary Bluesman, Cody Blackstone, loves playing at the Delta Blues Bar owned by his surrogate father, Barrelhouse Jones. Above it is the Delta Blues Hotel where most of his "extended family," old retired Blues players, now live. Cyrus Fordham, who owns most of Memphis, wants the land on which the Delta Blues Hotel stands and will stop at nothing to get it. However, he makes the mistake of having some of Cody's "family" murdered. Now Cody must put down his guitar and take up the sword becoming the other thing that he is know for; a one man wrecking crew. Battling corrupt politicians and their enforces in the police department, Cody evens the score and brings his own brand of justice to the Fordham Empire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135949</url></doc>
