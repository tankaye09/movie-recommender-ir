<plot>A man attends his new apartment for the first time, when he finds out the previous owner has left a lot of stuff behind. He decides to call him up, so he can retrieve his valuable belongings that he obviously has forgotten. Surely he doesn't want to miss his floppy disks, cookbooks and his pigeon calendar. But that's not all. A quick look at the house shows there's plenty of other 'items' he left behind. Maybe he does have a hidden agenda.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393952</url></doc>
