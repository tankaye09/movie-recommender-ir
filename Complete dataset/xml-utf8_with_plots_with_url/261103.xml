<plot>Businessman Joe Doakes receives a letter from Washington, DC. The last paragraph of the letter is highlighted and shown on the screen. It reads: "Therefore, if you are going to be in Washington or the vicinity on Thursday, August 26th, I could see you at my office, 5A4758 Pentagon Building. You might telephone me at NA 1234 on your arrival at the station and my secretary will make a definite appointment with you." It is signed by Henry M. Maartelson. Upon his arrival at the Washington train station, Doakes telephones Maartelson's office. His secretary tells Doakes that her boss is on Baltimore and won't be returning that day. He sleeps at the train station and tries again the next morning, but Maartelson has been called to New York. Doakes returns from his trip and is very vague as to the "important business" he discussed in the nation's capital.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261103</url></doc>
