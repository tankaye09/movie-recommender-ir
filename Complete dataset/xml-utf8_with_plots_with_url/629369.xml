<plot>"Under There" asks some pretty profound questions in a lighthearted way. Eight-year-old Samantha (JASMINE ANTHONY of ABC's popular drama Commander in Chief) is playing soccer in a cemetery when a mourner named Roman (RICHARD EDSON of Stranger Than Paradise, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Do The Right Thing) takes offense at the little girl's failure to show what he considers to be proper respect for the dead. Roman scolds Samantha, then takes it upon himself to explain the Christian perspective upon death. Samantha listens politely; however, in the end, she clings to her unschooled understanding of the relationship between body and soul. As far as the naive Samantha is concerned, human beings simply return to the earth when they die. And you know what? She may very well be right!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629369</url></doc>
