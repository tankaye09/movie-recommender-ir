<plot>Three smart girls enter ninth grade at top schools. There they confront, for the first time, a world very different from the one they come from. A story of youthful adventure. The tumultuous emotions of coming of age. The anxiety of measuring up to the standards of their new communities. Armed with freshness and honesty, the girls pierce through the preconceived notions of a new world, whose attitudes don't encompass a larger sense of experience or history. An intense and intimate journey that tackles a timely theme: How do we rethink "belonging" to include differences?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341048</url></doc>
