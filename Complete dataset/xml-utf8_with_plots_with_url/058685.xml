<plot>Banker to the Poor tells the enthralling story of Muhammad Yunus himself, who set up the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh to lend tiny sums to the poorest of the poor, who were shunned by ordinary banks. It's the story of overcoming skepticism in many governments and in traditional economic thinking. It is a story of a struggle and the unique and extraordinary methods he invented to combat human despair. It's a story of a man who fights to make his dream come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058685</url></doc>
