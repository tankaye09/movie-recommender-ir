<plot>In an old warehouse, on a wasted back-street of urban Los Angeles, an eccentric salesman, named Mr. Gun, sells weapons to a brooding ex-con named Demetri. As the arms deal progresses, Demetri grows increasingly agitated with Mr. Gun's eccentric sales approach and outrageously expensive prices. As Demetri reaches the end of his fuse, Mr. Gun offers one final deal. He brings to the table a strange, futuristic, toy-like weapon at a ridiculously low price. Taking this offer as an insult, Demetri becomes enraged with the dealer, and threatens him at gun-point. But, Mr. Gun has an Ace up his sleeve. In an explosive twist, he turns the tables to reveal a strange insight into Demetri's powerfully violent future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379703</url></doc>
