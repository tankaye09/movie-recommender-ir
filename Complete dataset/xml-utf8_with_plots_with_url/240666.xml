<plot>A bachelor is seen preparing for his morning tub. He steps behind a screen and apparently disrobes, as various portions of his attire come flying over. The house maid enters, and proceeds to clear up the room. Suddenly she becomes aware of what is going on behind the screen. At this moment the screen falls, and she is horror-stricken at her predicament. It turns out however that the young man is fully clothed in a suite of pajamas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?240666</url></doc>
