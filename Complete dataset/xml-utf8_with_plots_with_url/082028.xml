<plot>Peter Conway ('Clive Brook' (qv)) is a playwright and his new play is having its first night. At the party afterwards Peter is kissed by a woman he claims not to know. The woman is Pamela ('Judy Campbell' (qv)). At first she persues him but then produces some letters where he declared his undying love for her and she sues him for Breach of Promise (as the ladies could in the 1940s). But Peter has a nice scheme to defeat her plan - he marries her. She then does her best to bankrupt him. But why does she want to destroy him? A series of misunderstandings follow as we gradually realise what is going on as Peter &amp; Pamela part and come back together time and time again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082028</url></doc>
