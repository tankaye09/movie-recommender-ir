<plot>Loosely inspired by actual events, this film is partly a story of someone who feels that her world simply doesn't hold what she needs. It is also about the experiences children go through that aren't taken seriously by most adults (we prefer to think of children as essentially innocent and less complicated, while ignoring the depth and complexity of their inner lives). It is also about putting the viewer through an experience similar to that of a person being forced to re-evaluate what they thought they knew about someone, based on an unforeseen event.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401011</url></doc>
