<plot>DoriAnn is a Mormon Fundamentalist who shares a husband with her younger biological sister. During a private bathing ritual and candid interviews, DoriAnn explores the surprisingly everyday challenges of her marriage, and reveals her struggle to balance her faith with her feminism, and her spiritual ideals with her earthly emotions. As the film unfolds, the bath becomes a baptism and DoriAnn emerges as a full-bodied woman: complex, individual and utterly human. When DoriAnn explains why she stays in polygamy despite the daily heartbreak, her frank answer about spiritual transcendence is universal and unexpected. In a time when the practices of Mormon fundamentalism offer sensational fodder for the evening news, but little honesty, Sister Wife offers a rare and unflinching glimpse into a cloistered lifestyle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499169</url></doc>
