<plot>Instead of working for a living, Duke (Richard Bakalyan) and Freddie (John Brinkley) steal auto accessories and sell to a fence. While Duke is out driving with his girl Peg (June Kenney), she tries to dissuade him from a life of crime. Angered, he taunts her with another girl, Janice (Jana Lund), who has driven up alongside him, and they have a race. A motorcycle policeman who is chasing them is killed when he crashes into Janice's car, and she is held. Duke, who has driven off, paints his black car light blue to escape detection. Janice learns his license number, and in fear of being discovered, Duke kills her. Duke coerces Peg to leave town with him, committing holdups along the way. Realizing his luck will not hold out, but unwilling to surrender, Duke sends Peg back and remains alone in an abandoned roadside fruit stand, awaiting his fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246307</url></doc>
