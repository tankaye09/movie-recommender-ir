<plot>A mockumentary/dramadey about young man with a pitch and a dream to make a short film about short people, but things quickly take a turn for the worst when the director has intentions of continuing his streak of murdering his clients on film. In case of classified ads at their worst, this short brings laughter, suspense, and a ridiculous knife duel that takes you inside of the action and permanently breaking your funny bone. Death Lens challenges you to follow your creative endeavors with an optimistic attitude in a worst case scenario.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133897</url></doc>
