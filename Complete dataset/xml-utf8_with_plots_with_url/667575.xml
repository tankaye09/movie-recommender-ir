<plot>The morning after a one-night stand, Peter reads and rates obituaries, as per his usual, except Margo is there. Margo is there and wants to be noticed, but the obituaries are calling and he's just too focused. Feeling rejected and sensing his hypocrisy, Margo hurries out of his apartment, missing one shoe, asking him the legacy he's leaving behind. When he can't answer, she gives him the only shoe she can find and leaves. Later, reading the paper, he stumbles across the obituary for Juniper Winnows, a poet of intensely autobiographical themes, who, despite critical acclaim, left no remaining survivors and a legacy of contradictions. Sparking a personal revolution, Peter desperate and nearly heartbroken goes to Margo's apartment, rambling about Juniper Winnows death and the lost shoe. He apologizes. She finds him sincere. She offers him tea. He accepts and finally feels that, if nothing else, he might be OK.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667575</url></doc>
