<plot>This open-ended drama is designed to trigger discussion on the subject of equal opportunities for women in the workplace and on the role of unions in securing those opportunities and eliminating discriminatory labor practices. Though set within a hospital and focusing on one of several staff women who are denied access to a pharmacy training program despite suitable qualifications, the underlying premises, conflicts, and responses have implications that reach far beyond the hospital walls.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036932</url></doc>
