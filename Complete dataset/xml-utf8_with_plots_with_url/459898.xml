<plot>A woman is driven away from a funeral. As she gazes out of the car window, she enters an altered mental state and ponders key moments in her life and her own mortality. Statues in the cemetery trigger her memories and we see enchanting montages as she remembers being a carefree little girl; a pensive bride and an overjoyed mother- to -be. The only words spoken in the film are, "Thank you," and the last thing she focuses on is a sign saying 'Future Development'. Interwoven through out the film is a woman creating an exquisite sand mandala. At the end of the film, the mandala is destroyed in the Buddhist tradition, as a symbol of the impermanence of all things and the truth in life's temporary beauty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459898</url></doc>
