<plot>PETER, a young man has a rare genetic accelerated aging disease. Physically he has the withered body of an eighty-year-old. But mentally - emotionally - he is still 28. With all the passions and desires that young man has. JILL, his young wife loves him, but is physically repulsed by him. Beyond either's control, he is kept at an isolated rest home. Peter's been a resident there for going on four years now. Jill's visits, once regular, now grow sporadic. He's watching her slip away from him. He's losing her. MIKE, a young orderly has noticed Jill on her visits. A moment passes between them. Peter tries to rekindle their passion. Jill tries to fight her repulsion - and her growing attraction to Mike. This comes to a head, a confrontation that explodes into violence - and an unexpected ending.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036833</url></doc>
