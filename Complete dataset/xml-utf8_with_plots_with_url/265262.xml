<plot>It was Mickey Mouse who helped forever change the course of animated shorts. From his first appearance in 1928's "Steamboat Willie" to the current day, millions (billions?) of people worldwide have been entertained by the antics of Mickey and his large cast of friends would include, over time, his girlfriend, Minnie Mouse, and faithful canine companion, Pluto; Donald Duck, his girlfriend, Daisy, and nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie; Goofy (originally Dippy Dawg) and countless others. Each episode of the Disney Channel's "Ink &amp; Paint Club" shows a compilation of these classic cartoons, produced in color and (sometimes) black-and-white. Each show has a different theme, showcasing the most memorable cartoons from Disney's studios. More recent Disney cartoons are not featured (most of them produced as prime-time, Saturday morning or syndicated TV series); the collection featured on "Ink &amp; Paint Club" ranges from the 1920s through the early 1950s.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265262</url></doc>
