<plot>The boys show up simultaneously to take Olive to the movies. She needs to visit the hairdresser first, and tells the boys to take care of Swee'Pea: bath, dress him, and nap. Of course, with these two, nothing is simple. Bluto tries washing him like a shirt on a washboard; Popeye fights him, and Swee'Pea sneaks off and starts playing with a pen. Popeye cleans him up again. Bluto wrestles with Swee'Pea's night shirt for a while until Popeye solves the problem. While they carry the tot up to his room, he gets set down on a railing, ends up in the fishbowl, and gets rescued again. In his room, he is put on the windowsill while the boys argue again; a quick rescue later, he's back in the room, in Popeye's arms, while Bluto is punching Popeye out (thus making him rock back and forth).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?403112</url></doc>
