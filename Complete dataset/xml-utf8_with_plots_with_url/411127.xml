<plot>Days before the one year anniversary of her father's death, Jenny Dryden is released from the hospital facility where she was treated for depression. She returns home only to discover everything that was once familiar in her home has been removed or is in boxes and the walls to her bedroom torn down. With her life exposed and nowhere to hide, Jenny struggles to find a balance with her mother while fighting to keep her father's memory alive by spreading his ashes at their favorite place, a park near their house. However, Mary has different plans and has given away the ashes to Jenny's grandfather. Now both mother and daughter have to finally open up to one another and grieve together in order to move on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411127</url></doc>
