<plot>The Gloria family's new tutors are assigning homework-in subjects that aren't taught in most schools for young ladies of good breeding. However, despite the eager minds and bodies before them, things are looking grim for the teachers. Someone is out to ruin the family and they don't care who gets caught in the crossfire. And when a field trip ends in a fight for survival, it becomes obvious that someone wants school to be out permanently! But the truth will out, and when Kira and Beowulf discover who's behind the plot to destroy their charges, there'll be hell to pay. The women of the Gloria family won't be the only ones going down in GLO*RI*A!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208154</url></doc>
