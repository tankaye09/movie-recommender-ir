<plot>Here we bring into view what is considered being the most crooked railroad in the world. The steep grades and dangerous curves between these two stations are very stirring and the ride is one which all tourists take who visit California. A choice strip of scenery is shown in this film and the scene is greatly diversified as the train changes its direction suddenly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422028</url></doc>
