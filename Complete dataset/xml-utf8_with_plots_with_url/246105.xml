<plot>Using the same title as a 1941 Andy Clyde Columbia short, this ghost-host film finds Edgar (Himself) house shopping because his brother-in-law (Jack Rice) sold Edgar's home so he could get Edgar to buy a house from him. Edgar rents the rumored-to-be-haunted Parkhurst home, and after enduring all manner of haunted tactics, discovers that the late Mr. Parkhurst (Chester Clute) is very much alive and pretending to be dead in order to hide from his wife (Ida Moore). Edgar is now forced to buy his brother-in-law's house.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246105</url></doc>
