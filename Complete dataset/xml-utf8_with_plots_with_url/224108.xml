<plot>Johnny, a musician, belongs to the itinerent troupe of Hameed the ventriloquist. The star attraction of their show is the talking doll Urvashi - seductress, eternal child-woman, one who cannot age or die. When Hameed's voice fails, he sells Urvashi to Johnny, who returns to his small neighbourhood in suburban Mumbai. He reunites with his childhood sweetheart Rosemary and plans to resume his stage performances with Urvashi. To Rosemary who is eager to help Johnny, Urvashi almost seems like the other woman. Johnny's music and his talking doll are a hit with audiences which only fuels Rosemary's insane jealousy. Communal riots break out in the city and Johnny's songs unveil the true culprits behind the controversy. They hit back and Urvashi is destroyed. Johnny is silenced because his medium of expression is gone. Now Rosemary draws him out of his despair, brings him back on the stage and dances in place of Urvashi - the woman becomes the doll.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224108</url></doc>
