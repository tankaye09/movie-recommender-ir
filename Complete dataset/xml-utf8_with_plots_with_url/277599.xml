<plot>Tom just popped "the question" to Suzi and she couldn't be more excited. Everything seems perfect at first, but is Suzi all that she seems? When Tom wakes up finding himself tied and bound in a plastic covered room, he soon learns exactly what Suzi expects their life together to be like. As she literally cuts away the flaws in their relationship, Suzi makes it clear that this marriage will not be without sacrifice. Jitters is a graphic short film. Many scenes will test the stamina of audience members.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277599</url></doc>
