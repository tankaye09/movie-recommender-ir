<plot>Kapil's (Naseeruddin Shah) younger brother, Buntu, dies as a result of a drug overdose. Kapil vows to put an end to drugs and drug-dealers, by joining the police. He soon attains the title of C.I.D. Inspector. He lives in Bombay with his mom (Kamini Kaushal). One day his friend from Goa, Albert Pinto (Pankaj Kapoor) is killed in front of him. He vows to avenge his death, but the local police will not permit to do so, and they assign this incident to another inspector. Frustrated, Kapil decides to travel to Goa. Once in Goa, he finds out that he has no powers as a policeman, and the Goa police regard him as a nuisance. He attempts to uncover Albert's death, with the help of Jojo (Archana Puran Singh), but instead gets into brawls, is arrested, and is escorted by the local police, back to Bombay. But Kapil escapes from police custody, and soon he is on the run, not only the police, but local goons also, who will not hesitate to kill him instantly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273184</url></doc>
