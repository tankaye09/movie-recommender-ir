<plot>"Turnabout" unfolds in the course of a night - the night Billy Cain swallows a bottle of pills and collapses into the ocean, willing the waves to swallow him up. Instead, some fishermen carry him back to shore. What do you do when you're still alive on the night you planned to be dead? Billy calls his old high school pal Perry Hayes, whom he hasn't seen in 15 years. Perry has a family now, and a respectable career as an optician, but his life isn't perfect. Perry picks up Billy and buys him a meal, grateful for the chance to talk truth with an old friend who's in no position to be judgmental. When Perry confides his marital woes, Billy convinces him they both need to visit a local strip club. Before it's over, they lure two strippers to a motel room. The night turns into a haze of alcohol, sex and drugs. And somebody winds up dead. When a guy can't be sure what he did or didn't do, the slickest manipulator in the room decides who will walk free, and who will pay dearly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621298</url></doc>
