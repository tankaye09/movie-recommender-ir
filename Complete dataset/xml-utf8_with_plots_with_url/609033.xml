<plot>In 1968, armed with a ukulele, a falsetto voice, and songs from a forgotten past, Tiny Tim burst out on national television... People were wide-eyed, slack-jawed and confused. Who was this man; this troubador from another planet? They had never seen anything like him before... An eccentric singing machine. From his televised marriage on the Johnny Carson Show, to his sold out shows in Las Vegas, to his number one hit 'Tip Toe Through The Tulips', he had become unstoppable. Then... it all went away. So did he. Or so it seemed. This film documents the last 10 years in his life. From the entertainment company that began to revive his career in life, his tourmate and the venues that booked him, we are given true accounts of the man and his bizarre behavior. Welcome to the universe of Tiny Tim.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?609033</url></doc>
