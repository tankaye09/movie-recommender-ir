<plot>A man and his wife must get a mortgage payment to a banker's house by 6:00 pm or his mother will lose her house. He figures a train would be the fastest way to get there, but unfortunately he winds up on the Lazy Line, which is run by two goofs who care nothing for schedules--or speed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411193</url></doc>
