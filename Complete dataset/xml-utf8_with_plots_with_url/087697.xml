<plot>Scene III of the Buster Brown Series. Shows a bargain counter in a department store and a large gathering of women examining goods. It is a special sale, and a great deal of interest is shown by the ladies, who jostle and crowd each other to secure the choicest bargains. Mrs. Brown enters, accompanied by Buster and Tige. Mrs. Brown is unable to get near the counter and is in despair. Buster sees his mamma's predicament, whispers in Tige's ear to "take a fit," which he does by throwing somersaults high in the air, and running wildly about as though mad. The dog's actions frighten the shoppers and they scatter in all directions. After the stampede Mrs. Brown proceeds to make her purchases, while Tige seats himself on a stool, and Buster looks on very innocently.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087697</url></doc>
