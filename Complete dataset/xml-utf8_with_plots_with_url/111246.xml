<plot>This Columbia "World of Sports" short (Columbia production number 3809) features tennis champion Bobby Riggs, when he was in his prime, and three decades before he beat Margaret Court in a "Battle of the Sexes" tennis match, and then mouthed off so much about it that Billie Jean King, then in her prime, took him on and wiped up the court with him and put his old bones into retirement. There are those that think she could have beaten him in 1942 also, when she was still a baby. Riggs got more milage and attention out of playing against two women in the 70's then he did out of the many titles he won when he was younger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111246</url></doc>
