<plot>1991, Welsh band Manic Street Preachers arrived on the British music scene proclaiming their ambition to make one album, sell 16 million copies and then split up. 18 years, 9 studio albums, one missing member and many controversies later, they're one of the UK's most highly acclaimed bands. Narrated by their fans and featuring exclusive footage of recording sessions, live performances and interviews with the band combined with archival materials, No Manifesto takes an in-depth look at the Manics' history and creative process and explores the deep relationship between the band and their audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398336</url></doc>
