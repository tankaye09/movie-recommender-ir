<plot>A bitter divorce and a played out custody battle have left Adam unable to maintain the once flourishing relationship he had with his daughter Rebecca. Having to play the puppet to his ex-wife Karen's manipulative ways out of fear that he will never see his daughter again, Adam is rendered incapable of interfering in her new Beauty Pageant upbringing. However, when Rebecca begins displaying unusual sleeping habits and reveals her dislike for her mother's new boyfriend Bob, Adam is hit with the terrible truth that things are occurring with his daughter that are out of his control. A father's love compels him to make a decision that will change the fate of their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339166</url></doc>
