<plot>Ms. Appleton is a friendly and highly organized elementary school teacher who is nervous about a meeting she has scheduled with the parents of Dante, her most challenging student. Worry turns into real trouble for Appleton when she soon realizes Dante's parents can only see their child through 'rose-colored glasses'. Both absurd and only too real, "Parent-Teacher Night" tickles the funny bone as it tells its cautionary tale about people who believe everything they're told by the one they love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423665</url></doc>
