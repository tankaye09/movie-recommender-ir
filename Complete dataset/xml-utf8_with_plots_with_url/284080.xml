When the other backup knights arrive at the murder scene, Queen Catalina intentionally accuses Allura of the murder of her father, but Allura was not the murderer and Catalina was falsely accusing her due to her hatred of Allura. With Allura in a bad situation, her maid Rachel, helps her escape to the Black Forest. As the pursuers attempt to hunt down Allura, Rachel distracts the pursuers and Allura makes a run to the mansion. Just as Allura attempts the open the mansion's door, her right arm suddenly reacted with the Hand of Evil. Inside the mansion, Allura hears the voice of the Fiend, ordering her to kill anyone who tries to stop Allura. As the pursuers arrived in the mansion, Allura's right arm was revealed with the Hand of Evil which made the pursuers believe that she was the murderer of King Olaf. With this, Allura uses the magical power of Hand of Evil to control and set various deadly ceiling, wall and floor traps that would be her hope to kill off the pursuers going after her either to kill or capture her. As this crisis continues, Allura hopes to find the truth of who actually killed King Olaf and clear her name. Will she succeed?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284080</url></doc>
