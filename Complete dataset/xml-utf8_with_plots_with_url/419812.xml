<plot>Widowed Shantidevi lives in a small village in India with her daughter. She would like to see her daughter get married and settled down in a decent family, however, her headstrong daughter falls in love with a Bombay-based man named Arun, and when met with disapproval, she elopes with him. Shantidevi refuses to do anything with her anymore. Now about 18 years later a friend of Arun, Dr. Shakti Kapoor comes to meet Shantidevi, informing her that both her daughter and Arun have passed on, leaving behind their daughter, Paayal. Shantidevi reluctantly welcomes Paayal to her house, but subsequently both warm up to each other. Paayal meets and falls in love with a slacker named Arjun, and when introduced to Shantidevi, is approved and accepted. However, Arjun does not meet with Shakti's approval, and when Shakti persuades Shantidevi, she too rejects Arjun. The question remains why is Shakti against Arjun's and Paayal's marriage, and what made Shantidevi change her mind about Arjun?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419812</url></doc>
