<plot>After being teased and bullied by the other children in school because of her family's poverty, young Sakurako makes a pledge to her mother that, no matter what, she will never be poor when she grows up. As an adult, Sakurako is now a beautiful flight attendant hoping to find a husband with a promising future. She meets and falls in love with the brilliant Nakahara, but quickly dumps him when she discovers he only runs a small fish store (he had abandoned his career to take over the family business when his father died) . She then meets and gets engaged to a wealthy young doctor who expects to inherit his father's position as the head of a large private hospital. Everything seems to finally be going Sakurako's way, but she feels that something's not right in her life. Is she really making the right choice by taking a life of comfort and ease over life with a person she could truly love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663807</url></doc>
