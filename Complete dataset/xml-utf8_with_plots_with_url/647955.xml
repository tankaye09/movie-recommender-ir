<plot>Lavinia Academy is the elite boarding school for the brightest - or richest - girls in the nation. Maggie Reynolds is one of the bright ones, attending Lavinia on scholarship and kept outside the circles of her wealthy classmates. Her closest friend, Ria Navier, is similarly rejected but responds with a secret aggression; Ria steals their clothes from the laundry room then wears them as her own. Tonight Maggie will find Ria's dead body on the outskirts of campus. And tomorrow she'll discover that senior Ka Newton knows far more about Ria than she ever should. But now, Maggie is simply wondering why her friend skipped dinner, where she has gone, and what she meant when she cryptically whispered, "I know who it is."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647955</url></doc>
