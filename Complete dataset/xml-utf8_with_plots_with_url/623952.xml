<plot>"Taken at the Dry Tortugas, where the 'Nashville' is awaiting orders to sail. She is a gunboat, built in 1893, of about 1400 tons displacement. She differs in design from the rest of our navy, having very tall unprotected smokestacks. As she goes out of view, smoke is seen rising from the rear funnel. The honor of capturing the first prize of the war, the Buena Ventura (literally 'Good Luck') belongs to this speedy gunboat. A very strong picture, outlines well defined. The water is wonderfully calm and the reflection effects are marvelous for an ocean view."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623952</url></doc>
