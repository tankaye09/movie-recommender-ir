<plot>What would happen to the men of the world if all the women vanished? How would they manage with menial, day-to-day tasks, like making meals, tending to the baby and fetching things? Such a computer projection is "disproved", as a spokesman "demonstrates" how girls are innately softer and weaker than boys, and "explains" why men are superior to women - while ordering his secretary around the office. By the time he's finished, the women really HAVE left, and the men are left helpless. A witty, incisive and instructive look at casual and concerted male sexist attitudes towards women, this short cartoon (written by a man!) pokes fun at sexism by trying to pass it off as "natural".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017283</url></doc>
