<plot>Dario has just spent six years in prison for a sexual offense. On the day of his release, he swears that he will never return. The only problem is that Dario does not have a job or a flat, and he cannot stay with his mother Susann. He has no choice but to move in with his godfather Roger, who is living with his companion Borka and her daughter. Because Borka's daughter Tanja is the same age as the victim of Dario's crime was, Roger tries to keep his godson's past a secret. A hungry journalist from the local television station, however, uncovers Dario's past and warns the public of a second offense. When Dario goes to the annual "Street Parade" in Zurich together with Tanja, he is already being hunted by the press and the family of his victim who seek revenge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127042</url></doc>
