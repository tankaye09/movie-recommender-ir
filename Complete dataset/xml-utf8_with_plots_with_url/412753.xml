<plot>As a cruise ship threatens moving into Mayport Village, residents and supporters band together showing that community, livelihood, environment and health can not be bargained for. Journey the seas with shrimpers, and unveil Jacksonville's astounding lost history. This grass roots effort explains the story of this small fishing village fighting the wealthy and powerful cruise ship industry.
