<plot>To the sound of the title song being sung by a campfire, a cow and her calf are bedding down for the night. The calf is frightened by a shadow, until it's revealed to be a jackrabbit. He follows the rabbit deep into the woods, but neither of them notices the wolf following until it's too late for the calf. The calf is trapped in a niche under some rocks, which the wolf quickly digs out. The wolf is closing in on the calf when the rabbit tries to distract him, to no avail. The rabbit bounds off in search of the calf's mother, while the other animals use a porcupine like a battering ram. This buys enough time for the calf to run for home, just as the rabbit and cow are closing in. One look and the wolf runs off, and everyone heads home, with the calf looking back to thank the rabbit, whose ears clasp together above his head in victory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?244113</url></doc>
