<plot>Soon after starting his new job at an old Victorian manor, Eddie Silverton began having strange dreams. Dreams that would be usually forgotten the following morning, if it wasn't for the fact, he kept having the same dreams, night after night... Dreaming about places he never been too, and people he never knew, yet so familiar, dreaming about a man he does not recall ever seeing before. After becoming obsessed about the man from his dreams Eddies wife Denise becomes suspicious about his sexuality. This is a compelling story about a man plagued by hallucinations and haunting dreams that revealed a disturbing truth about his past life. Leading him to the edge of the cliff, the edge of sanity, to the place where seagulls cry is a song...to the place where it all began, to the place where he died.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653830</url></doc>
