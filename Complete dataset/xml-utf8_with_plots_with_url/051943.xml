<plot>A man is forced to choose between a life of perpetual uncomplicated slackerdom with his wise cracking crony and settling down to loving domesticity with his girlfriend. Director Mark Wihak handles this simple story with aplomb; the three characters are all believable and sympathetic, the uncomplicated direction never intrudes on the narrative and there is a lightness of touch throughout which is refreshing when compared to the showy MTV style of much contemporary cinema.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?051943</url></doc>
