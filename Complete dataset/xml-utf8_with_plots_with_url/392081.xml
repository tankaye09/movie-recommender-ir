<plot>After the death of his son, a hired killer struggles to escape the haunts of a lifetime of sin. Now asked to kill another man's wife, Alexander Poversky tries to hold onto what's left of his sanity as he spirals downward into a never-ending nightmare, making it increasingly difficult to stomach his chosen profession. Each death has become a tragedy, a tragedy followed by an obituary, an obituary with a name and a past. A name and a past for Alexander, he only wishes to forget.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392081</url></doc>
