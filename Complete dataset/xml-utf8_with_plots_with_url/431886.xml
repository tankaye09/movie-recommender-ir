<plot>This modest little movie filmed in Montreal offers almost an hour and a half of fresh, cute models engaging in hot sexual action. Filmed with a high-quality handheld camera, Director Conor J. Murphy (whose work we are unfamiliar with) captures all the action nicely at almost every angle from far-away to close-up. Throughout the movie, Murphy and his evil assistant Booster finds their models walking around the chilly streets of Montreal. Once inside, the guys are all personable, cute and know how to have a good time. It includes 5 hardcore sex scenes</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431886</url></doc>
