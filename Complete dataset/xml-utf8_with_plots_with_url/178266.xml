<plot>End of the Line traces the filmmaker's exploration of past relics and newer attractions of Coney Island behind her Super 8 camera on a hot day in July, as she takes in the the people around her, beach, the rides, the subway cars visible from the boardwalk, an abandoned museum building, and their stories. Having grown up listening to the stories of family who had spent much of their youth there, the filmmaker longed for her own experiences, and finally set out to discover first-hand what Coney Island had offered families and the world before it ceased to exist. Through the musing of memories by residents and visitors interviewed, and her exploration behind the camera of past relics and newer attractions, the film brings the viewer on a visual journey of a search for meaning and magic in Coney Island.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178266</url></doc>
