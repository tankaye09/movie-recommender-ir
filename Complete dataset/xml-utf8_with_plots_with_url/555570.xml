<plot>"The Epic Tale of Kalesius and Clotho" is a deadpan farce about the many forms of obsession and a hilarious chronicle of the first filmmaker to make a movie based on Koufos' ancient Greek myth Kalesius and Clotho. Director Kyle Gilman is obsessed with Jennie, his former leading lady. Unfortunately, she has moved away to New York and wants nothing to do with him. When he finds Janine, an actress who bears a striking resemblance to Jennie, he is sure that she will be the perfect replacement. Kyle's struggles to overcome his own incompetence, the incompetence of his cast and crew, and his obsession with Jennie, lead to increasingly awkward and comic situations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555570</url></doc>
