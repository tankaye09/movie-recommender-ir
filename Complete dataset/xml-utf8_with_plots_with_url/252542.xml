<plot>Set on L'ÃŽle-d'Yeu, a fishing island off the coast of Brittany, 'I KNOW WHO I AM !' is a carnivalesque multinarrative in the form of an epic trailer about a group of people desperately hunting for intrigue. It is an operatic, island-wide parlor game whose objective is to avoid discovering what remains when character is exhausted. SAKANAMA is a collective of creators whose work involves multimedia art, performance, writing, filmmaking, music, choreography and social engineering. SAKANAMA's primary members are Catherine Despont, Theodore Fivel, Chethwith Murosian, and Michael Portnoy, and individually their work has been presented at museums, galleries, theaters and music-venues and in printed-matter internationally.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252542</url></doc>
