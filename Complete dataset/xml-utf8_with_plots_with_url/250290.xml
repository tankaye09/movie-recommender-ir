<plot>It's the first day of tourist season at Peachstone National Park and Ranger Willoughby is told by his superior to "keep things ship-shape". When the tourists arrive, Willoughby tells the park bears they are free to take whatever food the tourists give them... all except Fatso, whom the ranger deems way too out-of-shape and instructs to diet intensely. Craving food, the bear tries to elude Willoughby and "pig out" but the omnipresent ranger always puts a stop to his antics. Finally, tourist season ends and Fatso, having gotten no food, is thin as a rail. Says the ranger, "Fatso, you're a mess. Have you been dieting?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250290</url></doc>
