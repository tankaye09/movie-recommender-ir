<plot>"Something Unknown is doing we don't know what.." is a quirky feature documentary on the science behind psychic phenomena. Is it possible that some people can read your mind? (Telepathy) Or look into the future ? (Clairvoyancy) Why is it that some people can cure themselves while in the last stages of a deadly cancer? (Healing). Are people who claim to see "distant" objects (Remote Viewing) fooling us? Or do they really 'see' something? Where is the boundary between real magical powers and fraud? Can these 'miracles of the mind' be explained? These and more questions will be answered in this documentary by Dutch filmmaker Renee Scheltema, who was inspired to explore the realms of psychic phenomena, after a series of curious and unexplainable events happened around her all at once.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506070</url></doc>
