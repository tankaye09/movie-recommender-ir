<plot>It was at the Meena Bazar that Shehzada Khurram first laid eyes on Arjuman Banu. When their eyes met it was love at first sight for both of them. When Queen Noor Jehan, one of the wives of Shahenshah Jehangir, finds out she is enraged, as she wants Khurram to get married to her daughter, Ladli Banu, even though Arjuman is her niece. She plots to hold Arjuman as a prisoner in her palace, but in vain; then she attempts to have Khurram sent away to battle - again in vain, as Khurram returns triumphant, and is named 'Shah Jehan'. Then she has her step-son, Saifuddin, arrange to kill Khurram - again in vain. Khurram gets stabbed but with Arjuman's help he recovers, returns home, but does not tell his father, fearing for his health. When Jehangir hears of Arjuman's assistance, he gladly arranges their marriage, while Saifuddin ends up marrying Ladli. Then Khurram is sent away to another kingdom, leaving Noor Jehan to plot against him. When Jehangir falls ill, she takes over the reins, has Khurram declared an intruder and sends her armies to bring him in or alternatively his two sons. Watch as events unfold, which will ultimately lead to the building of one of the seven wonders of the world - The Taj Mahal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?528946</url></doc>
