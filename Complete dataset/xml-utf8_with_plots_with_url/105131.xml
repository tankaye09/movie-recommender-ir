<plot>Christopher is a terrific kid. He's cool, he's nice and he's smart. But he has one big problem... he's messy! His shoes smell funky, his fish bowl stinks... even the cockroaches can't stand it. In the chaos of Christopher's room, his fish rise up from their scummy bowl in protest. They enlist the help of a fastidious, well-connected cockroach. Together, the fish and the roaches hatch a plan that will change Christopher's life and his cleaning habits forever. Christopher, Please Clean Up Your Room is part of the NFB's Talespinners collection. Created for children aged five to nine, Talespinners uses vibrant animation to bring popular stories from a wide range of cultural communities to the screen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?105131</url></doc>
