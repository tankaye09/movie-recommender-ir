<plot>A fugitive, wanted for helping the IRA in a bombing gone horribly wrong, is smuggled into the SF harbor. In order to hide here, and to lose all vestiges of his Irish past and disappear; into the new American identity. Sean soon finds himself at the mercy of one of his captors who is intent on using him in as series of hackneyed drug deals to make money. Sean searches desperately for a way out, but everyone seems to have their own motives with him. As Sean's past and future seem to disappear, Sean is left with little hope of a way out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151608</url></doc>
