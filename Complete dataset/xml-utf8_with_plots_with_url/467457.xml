<plot>Malky is a tattoo covered nightclub doorman with a penchant for violence. His armour is his heavily muscled body, his weapons - his hands and his feet. He has used physical prowess to beat back and keep at bay his many enemies. It is something he has done all his adult life. That is, until now. Malky is forced to come out of his dark world, finding himself at confession where he asks for forgiveness. Not for something he has done, but rather for something he is about to do. Something that will finally lay his hidden past to rest forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?467457</url></doc>
