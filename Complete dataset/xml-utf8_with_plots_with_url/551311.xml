<plot>The Cuna Indians live on small islands off the Caribbean coast of Panama. With no resources on their islands, families must paddle or sail their canoes daily to the mainland, to get water in the rivers, and to grow, gather, and hunt for food in the rainforest. They trade coconuts for many of their other needs. The women make their famous "Mola" applique blouses, and earn money by selling some to tourists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?551311</url></doc>
