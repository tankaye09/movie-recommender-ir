<plot>Travis, a self-absorbed photographer, is having a difficult day. He gets knocked off his bike while carrying equipment when he runs into a man crossing the street, who kisses him on the forehead and moves on the other way. When he's in a work session, he loses concentration when he sees visions of his client crying over a bib. He visits a friend who is angry with him and imagines violence. Finally, he meets a cable-access success coach whom he chooses to pass his recent gift onto, understanding that he's received the growth experience from it that he was supposed to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?414212</url></doc>
