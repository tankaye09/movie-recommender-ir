<plot>Vishwanath and Kalicharan are neighbors and close friends. They would like to get their children married, and thus strenghten their friendship into a relationship. But their children, Vishal and Priyanka, are quarrelsome, and not even friendly to each other, even though they are told that they will be getting married in the near future. Both enlist the assistance of landlord, Ramprasad, to convince their respective fathers that marriage is not for them. Ramprasad decides to create misunderstandings for the fathers, resulting in comical chaos, and danger from an unexpected source, for the two families and their friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277911</url></doc>
