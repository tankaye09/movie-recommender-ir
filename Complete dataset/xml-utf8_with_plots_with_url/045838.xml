<plot>Arnold Frenzy is the owner and presenter of The Strangely Compelling Flea Circus who has taken his group of fleas and musicians around festivals for many years. Friends and colleagues say that he will make it big one day and that the quality of his product and energy of his delivery will take him into the history books along with the masters of the art from years gone by. However things did not go totally to plan and his craft started to become an obsession that would lead him deeper into the world of flea circuses to the point where he started to lose connection with reality. This documentary looks at the rise and fall of the once great Arnold Frenzy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045838</url></doc>
