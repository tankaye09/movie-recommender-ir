<plot>There are two Hollywoods: One brings laughter &amp; entertainment to millions, the other is the site of endless toil in service of the industry. "No Plans for the Weekend" is the story of Bud, a lovable socially challenged newbie to Hollywood who, though out of his league in many ways, is driven to realize his dream of creating "tight" music videos. Working in the heart of L.A.'s music video industry Bud is in awe, not only by the glitz and glamor but also by the outrageous personalities he works for and with at Music Video Productions. At Music Video Productions, a.k.a. MVP, Bud is going to learn what it takes to succeed in La-La-Land.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398539</url></doc>
