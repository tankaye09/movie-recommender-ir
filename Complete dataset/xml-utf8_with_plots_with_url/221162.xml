<plot>The patient is a reclusive miner living on a lonely farm. Gracie is the object of his desire. On his deathbed, the result of a failed suicide, the patient re-lives both real memories as well as thoughts and images conjured by the obsession of a woman he loves but could never have. As a priest and nun sit at the patient's bedside, prepared to deliver him his Last Rites, we watch as the madness of the patient's comatose thoughts unfold through a landscape of terrifying nightmares. But, also through the dreams he envisions to be bliss-leaving him in a hellish perpetual state of his love and hatred for Gracie.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221162</url></doc>
