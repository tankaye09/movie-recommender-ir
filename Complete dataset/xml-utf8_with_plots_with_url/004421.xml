<plot>Behind the scenes at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Completed only months before 9/11/2001, "24/7: Airport" is a rare award-winning look at the inner workings of the famous airport (from the Tarmack to the Control Tower) that has been called the Ellis Island of the Space Age. Made in full participation with the Port Autority Of New York &amp; New Jersey, this fast paced film details many of the arduous and often dangerous tasks facing the thousands of men and women whose job it is to keep one of the world's busiest international airports operating smoothly - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Through sunny skies and three New York sized blizzards, Director/Cinematographer Neil Barrett and Producer/Cinematographer Chapin Wilson go behind the scenes where few cameras have been before or since.</plot><plot>Behind the scenes at John F.
