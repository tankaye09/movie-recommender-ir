<plot>Larry, a popular young boy, is looked up to and admired by his friends. It turns out that the reason he is so popular is because of his personal hygiene habits. He constantly washes his hair, cleans between his toes, lines public toilet seats with paper and has even more disturbing obsessions. As the narrator says, Larry's extra-squeaky-clean hygiene habits--something psychiatrists nowadays call obsessive-compulsive disorder--"are what give him such self-confidence!"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429757</url></doc>
