<plot>Vikram and Ajay are brothers who live a middle-class existence with their mom and dad. There is one important thing that Vikram learned from his father - the game of chess and how to remain ahead of the competition always. It is through his teaching that Vikram is now the unchallenged Don of the underworld in Bombay. Quite unknown to Vikram, his former rival Barrister Singh Chowdhry has recruited Qamaal Khan's gang to kill Ajay. They do succeed, leaving an enraged Vikram plotting vengeance, which includes making Raja, another gang leader, who runs black-marketing and other petty cons, to replace Ajay. Vikram uses Raja to avenge Ajay's death by killing Afzal, Qamaal's brother. Qamaal then kills Raja, and Vikram appoints Raja's friend, Vijay, who manages to kill Chowdhry, while Vikram is contemplating his future, not knowing that he has alienated himself from one of his closest associates namely, Peter D'Souza, who has now decided to betray him. The question remains, when one's very own pawns decide to change sides, who will then protect the King?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209152</url></doc>
