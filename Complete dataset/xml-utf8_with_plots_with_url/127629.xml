<plot>Four small time crooks, played by Aftab Shivdasani, Chunky Pandey, Ishrat Ali and Snehal Dabi, turn towards kidnapping for some quick money. They kidnap a millionaire's daughter, played by Isha Sherwani and are forced to barge into the home of a vegetarian Gujarati family of 35. The head of the household is played by Ishrat Ali. Their stay in the house gets extended when they learn than the hostage's father has gone abroad and they have to wait until he returns. The kidnappers are forced to take more hostages to keep their identity secret and prevent the kidnapping venture from failing. What follows is a "mad-mad comedy of errors". Manisha Koirala plays the part of a sales girl who is dragged into the fray when she arrives in the house in order to sell them shampoo.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127629</url></doc>
