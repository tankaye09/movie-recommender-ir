<plot>Former child actor and award winning Hong Kong martial-arts movie idol David Chiang directs and stars in this Chang Cheh sponsored outing which is a surprisingly liberal and progressive departure from their usual conservative themes as found in their signature martial arts resume. Instead, fans are refreshingly treated to this mature kaleidescope of comic sketches more along the lines of Li Han Hsiang's late filmography portraying human nature and man's search for love and desire, infidelity and sex during the free-wheeling 1970s in contemporary Hong Kong. Highlights of this satiric anthology include a youth who upholds his chivalry in the presence of his besieged girlfriend threatened by a gang of street thugs, a handsome bachelor cruising for action with tastes that aren't what it appears to be, a well-heeled established businessman with a propensity to frequent seedy love hotels or an outrageous raincoat clad flasher who is emasculated by an equally brazen female flasher counterpart and more. Co-stars Shaw luminaries including the director's thespian wife Maggie Lee and his brother Paul Chin Pei with a supporting cast including Shaw beauties Shirley Huang and Chen Ching, Kung Fu actors Philip Kwok, Lu Ti and Li Hoi Sheng, Cantonese screen legends Lee Heung Kam and Tam Bik Mun and with cameo appearances by Tina Chin Fei, Wu Ma and Adam Cheng.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?223941</url></doc>
