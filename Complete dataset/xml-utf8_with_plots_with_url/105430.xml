<plot>The comedic story of a man named Chob, who enjoys flirting with In-tu-orn, the daughter of a powerful and wealthy landowner who owns almost every acre in northern Thailand. In-tu-orn's father asks Chob to prove his love towards his daughter by taking a seven-day trip upcountry, attempting to quarrel with anyone he meets along the way. If Chob can complete this unusual mission he will grant his daughter's hand in marriage, along with half of his property. One of the first people Chob meets is northern girl Nalin, who is unlucky in love and wants to go home to cure her heartbreak but can't afford to travel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?105430</url></doc>
