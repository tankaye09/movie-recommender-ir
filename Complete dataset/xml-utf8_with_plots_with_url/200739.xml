<plot>Set in a small town outside of Chicago, Betty, a 96-year-old widow from Poland, lives a lonely life. Her day consists of simple chores, past memories, and waiting for the occasional visitor who never comes. But today is her ninety-sixth birthday and her young, twenty-something grandson visits her to celebrate for the day. He persuades Betty to get out of the house and takes her for a ride in her old '55 Chevy. The trip enlivens Betty, and as her grandson leaves and her birthday wanes, she is forced to confront her future and own mortality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200739</url></doc>
