<plot>It is afternoon at the time of the winter solstice. A small house stands on a hill overlooking the inland sea. Inside, an old man lies ill on a bed, attended by his son and daughter-in-law. Outside, another man sits by the door keeping vigil. Down on the shore, a boat is slowly being loaded with the personal possessions from the dying man's home. An old woman waits patiently nearby. After some time the son and daughter-in-law must depart, leaving the old man alone with his dreams and fading breath. His house, container of lives and memories, is closed and locked. Soon after, the old man reappears on the shore and is greeted by his wife, who has been waiting for his arrival. They board the boat that is to carry them to the Isles of the Blessed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599454</url></doc>
