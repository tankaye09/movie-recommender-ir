<plot>Tim and Angela Bayer's marriage has had its share of rough spots, but things seem alright for the time being. Tim has a good job working in Angela's father's diamond business, and the couple are expecting their first child. Their world comes crashing down around them, however, when Tim meets and spends a passionate night in the arms of a beautiful and alluring stranger, Carla Rainer. The following morning, as guilt-ridden Tim tells Carla that their one-night affair will never be repeated, he assumes the incident is behind him. Soon after the fateful night, Tim's life begins to spiral out of control. First, he receives a videotape in the mail showing him making love to Carla. Next, Tim's father-in-law invites Angela and him to a business dinner with a prospective client. This turns out to be Carla posing as another woman. Shaken, Tim agrees to meet privately with Carla, who threatens to destroy his family unless he turns over to her a large shipment of diamonds his father-in-law has ordered. When an acquaintance of Tim's who agrees to do some investigation of Carla, is found murdered, Tim begins to panic. He realizes that Carla is a vengeful force to be reckoned with.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185061</url></doc>
