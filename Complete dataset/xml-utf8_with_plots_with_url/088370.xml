<plot>Welcome to Football! is about being in love with the ultimate sports fan, and learning how to deal with it. It's not about making fans out of women who don't like or care about sports. It's not a feminine strategy for navigating a mans' world. And it doesn't go on and on about all the supposed "fun" you've been missing. It's all about having a richer, more meaningful relationship by discovering just how deep his emotions go, understanding why he cares so much, and bringing that passion beyond the game and into the whole of your lives. With 3 real life couples, a relationship expert, football instruction, a quiz game, plus honest interviews, the DVD explores a fan's love of the game, the rules of the game, and more - to help you understand what he can't express.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088370</url></doc>
