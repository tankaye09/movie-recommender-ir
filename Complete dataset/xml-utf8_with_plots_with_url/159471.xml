<plot>As his wedding day approaches, the architect Yannis keeps having a recurring dream that leaves him shaken when he wakes up. The girl in his reverie is stunningly beautiful, a blithe spirit who taunts him with her smile, her shapely figure, her sensual persona - all that a man would want as a companion for life. The real world, however, offers him someone entirely different. Anna is sweet, attentive, down to earth - all that a man could wish for in a normal marriage. The right decision, it appears, is made. And then it happens: Yannis's dream comes true - on his wedding day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159471</url></doc>
