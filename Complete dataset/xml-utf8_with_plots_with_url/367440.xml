<plot>Here is a subject for which there is great demand. It is a bull-fight complete from beginning to end and the fighting shown therein is spirited and full of action. The Toreadors are finally victorious and conquer the huge bull who, after being slain, is drawn by a team of mules from the arena, after which a new bull is introduced and the fighting continues. This is one of the most exciting pictures ever made and will take exceptionally well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?367440</url></doc>
