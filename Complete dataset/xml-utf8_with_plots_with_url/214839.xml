<plot>An extremely unusual and well-liked children's show starring Bill Jackson of "Clown Alley" fame. Each show was devoted to a "life lesson", like learning about responsibility, fire safety, etc. Jackson would also display his considerable artistic talents, in particular during the segment where he would go find a lump of clay named "Blob" (an actual vocal character who mostly made strange mumbling noises) and shape him into something.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214839</url></doc>
