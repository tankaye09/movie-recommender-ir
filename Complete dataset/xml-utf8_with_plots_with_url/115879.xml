<plot>In "Corralling a School Marm", the correct title for those who like their film history neat, local rancher/school board president Tom Simpson (Lee "Lasses" White) becomes smittened with the new school marm, Alice Lorraine (Virginia Vale), and thinks she is the same with him, which is not a great leap of reality for characters played by Lee "Lasses" White. Neighboring rancher and widow Martha Bakely (Jane Keckley), who has a bead of her own drawn on Simpson, enlists the aid of Simpson foreman Ray Whitley (Ray Whitley) and his musical cowhands to bring the old coot to his senses, which is a great leap for characters played by Lee "Lasses" White. Three songs and 15 minutes or so later, Simpson and the widder are paired off correctly, as are Whitley and the school marm.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115879</url></doc>
