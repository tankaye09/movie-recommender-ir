<plot>The Gooner Review highlights all the key talking points of the season and features the opinions of formers players including Bob Wilson, Perry Groves, and Peter Marinello. Gooner celebrities such as Starsky and Hutch legend David Soul, Fever pitch author Nick Hornby, Actress Linda Robson, Paul "Dennis Pennis" Kaye, DJ Judge Jules, ex-Eastender Tom Watt, magician Marvin Berglas, and the fans who go every week to support their team also voice their thoughts on the season. A part of the proceeds from the sale of the DVD will go to The Willow Trust - Bob Wilson's charity which was set up in memory of his daughter Anna. Anyone who joins the Gooner Review Club can vote on who should be in the film, what questions we should ask and which interviews we should keep in. And members also get the chance to be in the film and to come to the gala premiere.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?561713</url></doc>
