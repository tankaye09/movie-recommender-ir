<plot>Gerald Trimble, a humble, intelligent and sensitive man has been mistreated by society for the last several years, ever since he was wrongly accused of committing a sex crime against a young and vulnerable woman in his care. From a promising, well-respected graduate with his whole life ahead of him - He has had to face the loss of most of his friends, disowned by his family, ridiculed by members of the public, treated with scorn and contempt and facing constant suspicion by the police. He makes attempts to redeem his shattered life but considers reintegration into society is a lost cause. Trimble sets out to make himself forever free of his life of misery. But before he retreats away somewhere else in the world, he has one final task to complete... Vengeance. IR is a thought-provoking, serious drama that addresses society's ill-treatment of ex-prisoners released back into society and the potential fatal consequences that may ensue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267615</url></doc>
