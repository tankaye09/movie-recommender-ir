<plot>"Pappy Boyington Field" tells the story of the grassroots effort to honor a WWII Hero in the town of his birth. Veterans battled against bureaucracy for years to add a commemorative name to their local airport...and the campaign was not without controversy. Pappy Boyington was the Commanding Officer of The Black Sheep Squadron in the Pacific during WWII, he was an ACE Fighter Pilot, POW, and Medal of Honor recipient.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422655</url></doc>
