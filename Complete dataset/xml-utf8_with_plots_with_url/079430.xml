<plot>Two pretty girls are saying good-bye to each other when a crossing sweeper spoils one of the ladies' dresses and shoes by splashing them with mud. The bootblack is then called into commission and succeeds in making the lady presentable. She disappears after giving the knight of the brush a substantial reward. Then comes the joke. The bootblack calls his chum, the crossing sweeper, and they divide the spoils.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079430</url></doc>
