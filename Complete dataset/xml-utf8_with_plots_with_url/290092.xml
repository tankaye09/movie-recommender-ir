<plot>Jude Goodmen and Marcus Waters are the two very new guys in the mob. Their first job is to retrieve three million dollars of stolen mob money from the Jones Brothers. All seems well until their mob mentor, Bruce, pulls a double cross and frames the expendable Jude and Marcus. To make matters worse, the three million is hidden in a post office box and the search is on for the key. Now, Jude and Marcus have the Jones Brothers, Bruce and his men, and the rest of the New York City mob after them. Everyone is trying to kill them and the key to the three million, the Key To The Crime, must be found. All this and it's just their first day on the job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290092</url></doc>
