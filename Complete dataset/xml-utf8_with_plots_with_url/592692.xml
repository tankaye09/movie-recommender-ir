<plot>For the first time ever, the writers and staff at Sports Illustrated have pulled together their list of the 20 greatest college players to ever play. Hosted by Summer Sanders and with guests Pooh Richardson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the conversation will be heated as to 'who's on the list and who isn't. We will also be celebrating the greatest sports photographs in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592692</url></doc>
