<plot>Every year the 3D Animation industry brings you memorable animated movies. But before a character appears on the big screen, there is experimentation. Three dimensional characters are severely tested in the name of research and development. There are some successes but also disasters. 3D Animation is a process that involves breathing life into digital pixels.
