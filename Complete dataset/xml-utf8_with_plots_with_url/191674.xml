<plot>This pretty picture shows a well-known French character throwing some crumbs of bread to some half a hundred small sparrows. They fly all around him and perch upon his shoulders, hat and hands, picking the food that he holds out to them. Pleasing and interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191674</url></doc>
