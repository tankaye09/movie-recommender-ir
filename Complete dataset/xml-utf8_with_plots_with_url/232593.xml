<plot>"An elderly rounder comes home from his club very much in his cups, and starts to disrobe, looking meanwhile at his wife who is slumbering peacefully in bed. As he does so, she changes mysteriously to a skeleton. The old boy is greatly startled by the sight, and falls to the floor in a faint. When he looks up, however, the skeleton is gone, and his wife gets up and comes to his assistance."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232593</url></doc>
