<plot>Ishita (Benaf Dadachand) is a young school-going girl in India. She attends her school regularly, and is a caring and sharing child without any hang-ups. Although she comes from a fairly well-off family, she mingles with the other students without any airs. One day while returning from school, she sees some men making fun of a blind man (Raghuvir Yadav). She befriends him and tells the others to leave him alone. She wants to help the blind man to undergo an operation so that he can see. She will have to save a lot of money, and also face opposition from her mom (Kitu Gidwani); dad (Raj Zutshi), as well as school-teachers and fellow-students.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391649</url></doc>
