<plot>On The Edge This is the story of the combat soldiers of Company C, Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade who had fought on Mount Hermon on October 22 1973. After 30 years of silence they return to that night of battle - the conquest of Mount Hermon during the Yom Kippur War. They had not met all those years, and for the first time they put to words the horrors of the night they lost commanders, brothers in arms and a part of themselves as well. Years later they still have a score to settle about the battle, the feelings of helplessness that followed them on the mountain and through the rest of their lives, of death that was all around them and stayed embedded in their souls, and the heavy personal toll on each and every one of them. Up to now, these combat soldiers of Company C have not been accredited, as they should have been, with the conquest of Mount Hermon. This film reveals their story for the first time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411100</url></doc>
