<plot>Sahibaan lives a poor lifestyle in a small village in ancient India along with her mom, dad, Balakram, and a mentally challenged cousin, Kheru. Balakram makes a living selling dolls. Sahibaan is in love with a homeless laborer, Gopi, who lives near Mandirs and eats whatever the villagers give him. One day while chasing a rabbit, Sahibaan ends up in the palace ground of ruthless killer, alcoholic and womanizer Kunwar Vijay Pal Singh, is abducted by his guards and left at the mercy of Vijay, but Sahibaan manages to escape. Vijay, however, is unable to get her out of his mind and asks Diwan Durga Singh to search high and low for her. The Diwan is able to find her during a Mela and takes several men, sweetmeats, jewelry and clothing to propose to a delighted and disbelieving Balakram and his wife. They are angered when Sahibaan refuses to marry Vijay, and asks them to get her to marry Gopi. When Gopi proposes, he is humiliated, beaten and asked to leave. Diwan returns to Vijay, who decides to kill Gopi, locates him, beats him, and throws him in the river. When Sahibaan tells that Vijay had attempted to molest her, Balakram refuses to permit her to marry Vijay, despite of the fact that Vijay promises to stop drinking alcohol and having his way with women. Both Balakram and Sahibaan set out to try and locate Gopi. The question remains will they be able to locate Gopi in time?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473864</url></doc>
