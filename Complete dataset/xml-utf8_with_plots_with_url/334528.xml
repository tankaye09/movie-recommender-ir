<plot>A chilling tale of six young students who have just graduated from high school on the 10 year plan. They need a place to celebrate this great day. Why not at the local asylum that has been closed down for years! It doesn't turn out to be the kind of party they expected! One by one they are murdered! Is it a patient that never left? Is it a doctor that went mad? Or, is it one of them?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?334528</url></doc>
