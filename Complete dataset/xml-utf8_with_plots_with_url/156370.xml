<plot>Football player, Vijay Saxena, has a sweetheart in Nisha. Both decide to get married and Nisha moves in with the Saxenas, which include Vijay's two younger brothers Kamal, who is studying medicine, and Sunil, who is in college. Soon Nisha gives birth to a baby girl who they name Minnie. Tragically, Vijay loses his legs in an accident and is confined in a wheelchair, with Nisha being compelled to seek employment with Mr. Pradhan as a Personal Assistant. Kamal then announces that he wants to get married to wealthy Deepa Malhotra, but her father, who is known to Mr. Pradhan, has only one condition that Kamal move out of the Saxenas house and live with him. Kamal does so, and it is then they come to know that Malhotra had seen Nisha in compromising situations with Pradhan. When Vijay comes to know, his world gets shattered, he goes into a numb and accusatory silence. The question remains, is Nisha really having an affair with her employer?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156370</url></doc>
