<plot>Every November an interfaith retreat is held at the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps in Poland, where more than 1 million people, nearly all of them European Jews, were exterminated by the Nazis. Why would someone participate in such a retreat? How could anyone attempt to pray or meditate in such a place? In Spite of Darkness tells the story of five retreatants among them, a Rabbi, an atheist, and a Catholic priest-and how they come face to face not only with their own vulnerabilities and complicity but with new strength, peace, and glimmers of hope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262271</url></doc>
