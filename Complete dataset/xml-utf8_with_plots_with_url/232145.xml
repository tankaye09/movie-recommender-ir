<plot>Hawkland (Rattfink's country), and Doveland (Roland's country) went to war. Roland was in a plane holding peace sign to end a war, but instead, Rattfink destroyed the plane (with cannon), and Roland fell down. Roland got another plane and this time, the giant cork covered Rattfink' cannon and Rattfink's plane fell down. Than Rattfink had a huge atomic bomb (looks like an blimp) and Roland Was able to bring to move the bomb to Hawkland and Rattfink quickly got the bomb, but it was too heavy and dropped the bomb on Hawkland. Doveland won and the resident awarded Roland with a bag of gold, until tax collector takes it away, and give it to Rattfink. When Rattfink saw his mother, asking for a dime, Rattfink kicked the cup and mother hit Rattfink.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232145</url></doc>
