<plot>Obstacle races are considered great sport by our English cousins. We present a fine film of an obstacle race, taken in merry England. The participants are a sturdy lot of young fellows, who, while they furnish amusement for those who look in, appear to enjoy the sport. Many funny situations are witnessed. Some of the boys are less lively than the others, and instead of jumping across the small streams which lie in their way, fall headlong into them but rise immediately covered with mud, and rush along, pell mell until they meet with the next obstacle. Very interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037364</url></doc>
