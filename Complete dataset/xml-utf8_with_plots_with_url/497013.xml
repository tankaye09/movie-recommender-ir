<plot>American-produced-directed-written films by Richard Bartlett and Earle Lyon were guaranteed to resemble something from Monogram or PRC on a bad day at Monogram or PRC. This overseas-production for Lippert falls way short of that. Some source seems to think that Nanette Bordeaux and Huntz Hall were in this film, but the actress in this film is a French actress named Jeannette Bourdeaux and Huntz Hall is nowhere in sight, although an untalented character vaguely resembling him is on board. A small patrol lands on the French coast near Dieppe with the objective of wiping out a German communications center inland in preparation for an Allied Commando raid. The question of why if these guys can do that, why don't the Commandos just do it themselves on their way in goes unanswered..as does the one about why was this made to begin with.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?497013</url></doc>
