<plot>Amal, a simple humble man, is content with the small but vital role he plays serving his customers in his modest autorickshaw. Driving students to school, worshippers to the temple, and people to work, Amal is impervious to any hardships, and never deviates from his sense of faith as he winds his way around the chaotic capital of New Delhi. But when he's presented with an unexpected twist in fate, Amal's sense of purpose is challenged against everyone's wildest dreams. Set in the bustling streets of New Delhi, "Amal" is a story about dreams being lived by the unlikeliest of people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033552</url></doc>
