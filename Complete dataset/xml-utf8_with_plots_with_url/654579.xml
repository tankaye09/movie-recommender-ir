<plot>Plantation owner William Hawks (David Newell) doesn't approve of the fact that most of the white men on the island have married, or are living with native girls. He doesn't approve of mixed marriages and is equally opposed to accepting the "gifts of love" offered to him by the native girls. One night, after several hours of hard drinking, he sees Leilani (Mona Maris) bathing on the beach, and he watches her until he can resist his craving no longer. He catches her in his arms and she willingly accepts his embraces. She comes to live with him and waits on him hand and foot. Hawks goes to San Francisco for a planter's convention and, when he returns, brings back society girl Lucille Cheney (Virginia Cherrill) as his wife. Leilana is heart-broken, while Lucille becomes quickly bored with her husband and Hawaii. Her boredom ends when Chandler Morris (Hardie Albright) sails into port on his yacht and he and Lucille begin an affair. Hawks drinks to forget. He catches Lucille and Chandler together and a fight ensues, Lucille, in an effort, to save her lover throws a kerosene lamp into the ripe sugar cane and fire spreads in all directions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654579</url></doc>
