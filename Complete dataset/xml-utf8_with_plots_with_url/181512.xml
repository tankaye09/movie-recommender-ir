<plot>A woman is seen partially disrobing preparatory to taking a bath. She retires to a clump of bushes to complete her bathing toilet, leaving her clothes on the ground. An escaped convict comes along, and seeing the woman's wearing apparel, conceives the idea to disguise himself as a woman. Donning her clothes he leaves his own in place of them, and flees for safety. The woman finally returns, and in the absence of her clothing, she puts on that of the convict. Officers in search of the convict appear on the scene and arrest her. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?181512</url></doc>
