<plot>Ten years ago four close friends, just out of high school, had planned a several-day hiking/camping trip. One of them died just before the trip, and the remaining friends were separated. Now, a family death brings one of them back to town and the paths of the three remaining friends cross. In a character study that resides somewhere between romantic comedy and drama, they embark on the journey scheduled years before--both for themselves, and their dead friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279891</url></doc>
