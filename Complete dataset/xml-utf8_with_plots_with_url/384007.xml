<plot>Pearl Chase is legendary in the history of 20th Century Santa Barbara. The results of her indefatigable activism are evident throughout the City today. The film begins with Ms. Chase's being heralded in 1969, at her grand 80th birthday party, and then looks back at her family, and her personal and professional development. Early in her life, she announced her intention to do whatever she could to make "dirty, dusty" Santa Barbara into a beautiful, livable place. The film shows how she developed her resolve, how her vital relationship with Progessives inspired her, and how the devastating earthquake of 1925, provided her with an opportunity to effect her vision. The film progresses through the arc of her career.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384007</url></doc>
