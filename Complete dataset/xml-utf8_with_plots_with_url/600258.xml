<plot>A family of lobstermen are reunited when the dying, compulsive lying matriarch of the family wants to stage a Remembrance Ceremony while she's still alive. Her estranged son Alex is forced to endure the week with his proctologist Uncle; his religious spouting Aunt; his 'nam flashback Vet Uncle; his Don Johnson obsessed brother; and his ex-girlfriend, a nurse who is caring for his mother. All the while Alex has to listen to his father, who wants him to become a fisherman like himself. The Wayfarers is a feature film dramady about family, love, and lobster set against the backdrop of a New England fishing village.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600258</url></doc>
