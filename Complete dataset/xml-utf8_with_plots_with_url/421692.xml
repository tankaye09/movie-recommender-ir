<plot>Imagine "Changing Rooms" meeting "Scrapheap Challenge" meeting Max power magazine and you have "Panic Mechanics". Two teams are given Â£2,000 and two days to turn a car into... well another car, but a car fit for another purpose to one it was originally designed for. For example, a hearse into a dune buggy. Fast-paced from the word go, not only do the teams have to redesign and build their new cars in just two days, they must also face an obstacle course and a test where they must diagnose a fault on a car and drive it out of the harm's way before it is crushed by a tank.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421692</url></doc>
