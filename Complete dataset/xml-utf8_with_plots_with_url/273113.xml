<plot>Alaknanda lives a wealthy lifestyle with her widowed dad, Dr. Verma. She is fond of dancing and singing to such an extent that she refuses to marry the groom her dad has chosen for, runs away to Laitpur, enlists in the song and dance troupe that Rajkumar Kailash runs in his palatial house called 'Lalit Mahal'. Both Kailash and Alaknanda meet and fall in love, but Kailash's mom wants him to get married to Rajkumari Rupmati. Then when Alaknanda is performing, she meets with an accident, is hospitalized with a fractured leg that may never heal. Afraid to show her face to Kailash, who still insists on marrying her, she uses her crutches to escape from the hospital, ends up with a gang of bandits, is rescued by Kailash and brought home - where circumstances will again put her on the stage to perform a dance. The question remains how can a cripple perform a dance?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273113</url></doc>
