<plot>"Deadworld" veers from the popular zombie mythology of depicting an apocalypse in which humans are overrun by flesh-eating corpses. "Deadworld" picks up four months after that event, where the Dead overtake the Earth, with humans few and far between. Protag is King Zombie, a Harley-riding corpse who holds a grudge against the survivors who made him an outcast.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133515</url></doc>
