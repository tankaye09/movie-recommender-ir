<plot>Many people are faced with challenges everyday. Many people have felt pain, loss, anger and loneliness. That is the condition of the human race. These feelings are what make us 'human'. Another element of humanity, is the fact that we can all think for ourselves. The choices we make are our own, whether they be good or bad. We must be responsible for them. This story delves into the life of a troubled old man, you are confronted with a series of unlucky events that have scarred him. Starting small and building up, his luck seems to be nothing but bad. The choices that this man has made in the past, will shape the choices that he is left with in the future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412147</url></doc>
