<plot>Here is another laugh producer. A maid is sent to a neighboring town by her mistress and takes the baby with her for company. A traveler, who occupies the same compartment on the train, insists on making love to the maid who appears to resent it. Learning that they would soon reach a long tunnel, she presumes that the fellow will attempt to kiss her and she prepares herself accordingly by partially undressing the baby and when the train emerges from the tunnel he sees, much to his disgust, that he has kissed the baby on that part which was made for it to sit on. Exceedingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345422</url></doc>
