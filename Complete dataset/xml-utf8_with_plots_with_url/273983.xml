<plot>This pictures shows the world-famous Kitamura, the Japanese Foot Juggler. Watch him juggle a live Japanese boy with his feet, never touching him with his hands. It is truly marvelous, and were he to drop the child he would undoubtedly dash his brains out on the floor of the arena. Exciting yet fascinating.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273983</url></doc>
