<plot>Commissioned in 2000 by Associacao Cultural Videobrasil for the Contemporary African Art Show in Sao Paolo, this is a documentary about William Kentridge, one of the most important contemporary artist in South Africa and in the world. His creative activities include films, drawings, animations, installations, theatre and opera. In this film, shot in Johannesburg and Brazil, he talks of the impact of the South Africa landscape and social conditions on his work, and comments on his work process, inspiration, and the life of characters like Felix Teitlebaum, his alter ego.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657460</url></doc>
