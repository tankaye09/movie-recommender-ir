<plot>Henry, a middle-aged exterminator whose wife left him with two teen-aged kids (one pregnant), a faltering business, and a crew of oddball bug killers, meets up with Kate, a struggling singer-songwriter living in a rundown hooker motel with her precocious 10 year-old son, who spends his days in an empty cardboard dishwasher box, reading Vanity Fair Magazine. At Henry's invitation, mother and son seek a safer harbor, relocating into Henry's battered and leaky fishing boat, dry-docked on cinder blocks in his front yard. Float Your Boat is a funny, warm and unpredictable story about the relationship that develops between them all -- based on luck, heart and perseverance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197905</url></doc>
