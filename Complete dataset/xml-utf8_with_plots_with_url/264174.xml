<plot>Isolated in a fireworks tent on the side of the interstate is not how Samantha thought she would be spending her summer. A tragic turn of events leaves her desperate to pay rent and with no choice but to take a job offer which promises $1,000 for 10 days. With no bed, no food, no plumbing and seemingly no hope, she receives sustenance from the small town community and develops unlikely friendships with those whom she would have previously rejected. Just when she thinks she can control her environment, she is rendered helpless by an oncoming tornado. When her salvation comes from a local woman from the wrong side of town, Samantha learns that survival begins with acceptance. Based on a true story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264174</url></doc>
