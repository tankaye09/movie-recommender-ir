<plot>Evan and Kody were always meant to be together. In fact, Kody came to the conclusion that they would marry at the ripe, old age of seven. However, after Evan loses his father to a sudden heart attack, their fates quickly change. Fast forward ten years, Kody has moved away, and Evans brother Michael is now an up and coming actor. Unlike Evan, Michael lives life in the fast lane and will do whatever it takes to maintain his lavish, playboy facade. Meanwhile, after being turned down by the college of his dreams, Evan is persuaded to join his brother in the bright lights of Hollywood. But beneath all the grandeur of flashy cars, gorgeous women, and trendy nightclubs, Michael's drug addicted, ruthless lifestyle begins to take a toll on everyone. The Midwest simplicity of a budding romance disappears under the harsh glow of Mafioso headlights and paparazzi flash bulbs. Kody and Evan's re-acquaintance coupled with Michael's secret double-life lead to an explosive and heart breaking ending in which Evan is forced to choose between sacrificing a reemerging flame for his own brother. In deciding, we find that sometimes a second chance comes at the fragile price of innocence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125775</url></doc>
