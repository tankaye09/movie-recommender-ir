<plot>In this mystical adaptation of a David Henry Hwang one-act play, gender differences and cultural intolerance is explored through the encounter between a witch and a samurai. The fable begins with the samurai dispatched by the village to kill the witch who lives in the woods, who is believed to imprison men's souls. However, the samurai finds himself subtly disarmed by the open heart of the witch. Attracted to each other, they challenge each other over a formal tea ceremony, a martial arts contest, and a deadly game of sword play - only to find themselves drawn together to be pulled apart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?508159</url></doc>
