<plot>"Dark Operations; A Dark Odyssey Begins" is the pilot episode of a series that will follow the epic journey of Captain Royce McGregor and his brave crew as they are recruited by Dark Ops for a mission almost certain to take their lives. Following the destruction of his ship, and the death of most of his crew, Capt McGregor and his fellow survivors find themselves pulled in to a society that the outside world doesn't even know exists. Led by the highly decorated Admiral John Winston Cross, Dark Operations sits as Earth's only hope for survival against the increasing Vrill threat. After the strong-arm recruitment by the Admiral, Capt McGregor and his crew are trained for battle and given Dark Operations' newest flag ship. The USS Armstrong is a powerful warship built to survive the long engagement that her crew will face against the Vrill. As our pilot episode closes, Captain McGregor and his crew leave Dark Ops Head Quarters and begin their mission of genocide. Their goal: To neutralize the Vrill threat and return home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127246</url></doc>
