<plot>Rishabh and Parineeta are both deeply in love with each other. He is a wealthy young man, working in an advertising agency while she is a hardworking, dedicated doctor. Both marry and soon Pari is pregnant. Pari has a dream to create a hospital for children. Tragically, Pari is suddenly involved in an accident, and both the baby and she die in hospital. Pari's last wish was to donate her heart to a patient of hers called Dhani. Rishabh is devastated, and opposes the plan to donate the heart but goes ahead with Pari's last request. Dhani is cured much to the joy of her family and her grandmother. Rishabh has gone into depression but soon comes across Pari's project to build a hospital for children. He plans to fulfill her dream and begins to develop the hospital. Soon enough Rishabh and Dhani come across each other and she feels an instant attraction to him. Rishabh ignores her advances as he is still very much in love with Pari. Rishabh does not know that Pari's heart was given to Dhani and soon he relises that but there Dhani faints then he starts to fall in love with her to thinking as if she is another Pari that has the same heart and then Dhani and Rishab get together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150248</url></doc>
