<plot>Indian Ocean: the most significant music band from India. Based in Delhi, this band has been around for 16 years doing ground-breaking, timeless work outside the mainstream, with great integrity. Indian Ocean's music has admirers ranging from the youth in colleges around India to the middle-aged NRI in corporate America. Using primarily Western instruments (acoustic guitar, bass guitar, drums, tabla), they have created a very Indian sound which is strangely also uniquely their own. The band has created less than 30 songs during this time and more than half of these are bonafide classics. Leaving Home is the story of the four men who make music together as Indian Ocean in a contemporary India where commercial concerns are overriding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328012</url></doc>
