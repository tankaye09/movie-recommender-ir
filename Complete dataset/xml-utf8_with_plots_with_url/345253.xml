<plot>The amazing times of King Charles the Great (Charlemagne) served as the base for a great number of popular legends on continental Europe. He lived in the 8th century CE and despite being a warrior who through a significant numbers of battles succeeded to unify for the first time in history a divided continent, he was also a man of culture and a great believer in the need to help the needy. People loved him and told innumerable stories not only about him, but also about his valiant knights and the beautiful ladies with whom they weaved love stories. Without any doubt, the most exciting of such stories remains the French "La Chanson de Roland" (The Song of Roland) and its Italian versions "Orlando Innamorato" and "Orlando Furioso". In a magnificent, dramatic way they follow the noble and fearless hero Orlando, Charlemagne's right hand, through his adventures filled with passion, devotion and search for the truth. Along him, joining him or opposing him ferociously, are other unforgettable characters such as the knight Rinaldo, the stunning Angelica, the opposing leaders Rodomonte and Gradasso, the unique female knight Bradamante, the wizard Atlantes and many others. "Love and Virtue" bases itself broadly on these legends, but takes the topic much further by developing a fascinating view on difficult life choices, the meaning of friendship and the anguish of true love. The superb historical background and the captivating personalities of the various heroes are employed to create an atmosphere of magic, extraordinary music, soul-moving drama and beauty that will certainly leave a powerful imprint on the viewer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345253</url></doc>
