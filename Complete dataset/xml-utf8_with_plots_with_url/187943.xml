<plot>This documentary looks at the surprising contributions to American society by Catholic Sisters. Religious women historically have made enormous humanitarian contributions that have largely remained unrecognized. They founded, staffed and often funded an array of schools, hospitals and social service institutions across the country where there were none. They faced anti-Catholic discrimination and had little financial resources to work with, yet they became entrepreneurs raising funds and resources to take care of the needy. Sisters distinguished themselves as nurses during the Civil War by demonstrating generous and unbiased humanitarian acts to soldiers on both sides.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187943</url></doc>
