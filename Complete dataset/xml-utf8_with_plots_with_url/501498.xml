<plot>A man who's had a rough morning at the office feigns illness and, instead of heading home, drives 30 miles up the cape to an isolated beach where he takes off his shoes and suit coat, sits on his portable chair, and relaxes with a cigar. He even has a pocket tool for snipping cigar ends to improve their draw. A few minutes into his quiet bliss, he's interrupted by the arrival of a small boy, who's alone, maybe four years old, carrying a pail and small shovel. The man tries his best to shake the attentions of the lad, but things only go from bad to worse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?501498</url></doc>
