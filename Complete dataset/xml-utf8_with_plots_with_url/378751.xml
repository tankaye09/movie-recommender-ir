<plot>This documentary spotlights a handful of very talented extreme snowboarding veterans as they converge on Mount Snow Vermont in February 2006 to take part in the 10th Annual Tyson Ski &amp; Snowboard Excursion. Captured for the first time on video, this two day hardcore event known by the locals and participants as Mountain Mayhem, takes the group literally to the edge -- high atop snow-blanketed Mount Snow, Vermont. Each with his or her own reasons, the group assembles to compete for the coveted Tyson Cup. The two-day contest, ceremony highlights, and apres ski shenanigans are chronicled. Andy Tyson's Mountain Mayhem is to snowboarding what Mavericks is to big wave surfing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378751</url></doc>
