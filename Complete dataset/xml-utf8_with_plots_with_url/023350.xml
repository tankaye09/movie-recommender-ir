<plot>Addiction is about Bronson, a street smart cop, who is attacked and infected with a deadly drug called Xtreme. Like thousands of other victims, her days are numbered. Frustrated with working in a city that has become a haven for dealers, addicts and other degenerates, and feeling powerless as a cop to combat the drug epidemic, she turns vigilante and wages her own war on the drug underworld. She crosses paths with a gang of mercenary opportunists known as the Machine Gun Jury who have an intimate knowledge of the drug underworld. Their deadly alliance coupled with the intelligence and protection she receives from her father, the Police Captain, means that she has a devastating and crippling effect on the drug world. However, Bronson's impulse for justice battles with her need for vengeance. She loses her way in the moral vacuum that she now inhabits, and she becomes a different kind of addict - a killer and perhaps even a monster. She now has a new addiction - the kill is becoming her high. What the cops can't touch, she is going to obliterate!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023350</url></doc>
