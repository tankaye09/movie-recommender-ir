<plot>Melinda is trying to find a new wife for her grandfather, the slightly loopy widower George, whose seemingly sole interest in life is meteorology. She is convinced that he is going to die soon if he continues to live on his own. She then becomes obsessed with the idea that she has to help him find a suitable mate. Clacton seems like a promising setting for romance, but Melinda's ingenuous planning has not quite considered that George himself might be the biggest obstacle. He does not seem to understand what is best for him, much to Melinda's annoyance, and is mostly preoccupied with his meteorological observations. To make matters worse, he is a complete novice in the art of small talk. Melinda has to do all the work herself; and she really has to exploit her imagination and ability to think on her feet in order to avoid a total failure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?242946</url></doc>
