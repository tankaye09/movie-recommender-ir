<plot>Complete with 5 pregnant women in pink bikinis, a stilt walker and sword swallower, Fluid Movement is a short, exceedingly sweet, independent documentary that follows an earnest group of Baltimoreans through the hilarious process of staging an amateur water ballet in an inner city pool. Age, body type and fitness are of no obvious relevance nor is the ability to swim in the casting of "Cirque De L'Amour", a French-inspired synchronized swimming event extraordinaire, as long as everyone has the desire to improvise and collaborate creatively with their neighbors. From the "artists" to the ubiquitous old Ukrainian woman and the dry, game-for-anything pool manager, everyone joins together in a valiant effort to take back the declining park.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198403</url></doc>
