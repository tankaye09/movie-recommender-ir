<plot>Mary is an actress who is supposed to be shooting a movie today. Her director, Todd, has already put up with several delays and reschedulings due to what she calls "a Charlie day". It's a very sensitive issue, and one that must be handled delicately and with caution. Once again, she cancels on him, much to his frustration. Bound and determined to find out who or what "Charlie" is, Todd takes his camera, documentary-style, and decides (by talking to her friends and people she works with) he'll find out why Charlie has such control over her. What he discovers is an unexpected surprise, but one that women will most certainly sympathize with. If you've ever been in a "sensitive" relationship, you will completely identify with this hilarious short film about a woman coming to terms with her own worst enemy!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100250</url></doc>
