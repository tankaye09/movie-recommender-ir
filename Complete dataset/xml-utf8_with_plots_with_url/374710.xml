<plot>The main character is a shipbuilder who wanders off after his first ship is launched. He takes to the road, and his life takes him from one woman to another, while his wife is in waiting. He has a summer shack built on the sanddunes of the Baltic. One night a horde of hippie-like guests end up drunk and destroy his home, taking it apart to set up a big bonfire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374710</url></doc>
