<plot>Maine Women: Living on the Land celebrates the relationship between land and home. It is about what happens to the land we live on that creates the spirit and soul of a place. This documentary features ten Maine women who have lived most of their lives on the land either by producing a product or building a community. The stories these remarkable women share have a common thread in their sense of community and legacy of family traditions of work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352825</url></doc>
