<plot>Drake, a lonely accountant/vampire who doesn't seem to have much luck with the ladies, tries his hand at Last-Minute Mate Speed Dating. Will he score any points with the sexy, outspoken Vanessa who has more in common with Drake than she cares to admit? How about the lusty Goth girl Sara who seems to like Drake for all the wrong reasons? Milla seems like the nice girl next door. But will she go for a dork like Drake? As he wades through all the different personalities, deals with a flamboyant event crasher, and takes the brunt of a hostess' jokes, Drake realizes that dating doesn't just suck, it bites.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072115</url></doc>
