<plot>This picture shows the improved method of mowing the hay fields, raking the hay into windrows and leaving it ready for drying and carting away. This film aptly illustrates the advance of modern science and the ease with which a formidable job of work is now accomplished in one-tenth of the time that was formerly taken by hand. This series of films is of great interest in any rural community.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?563774</url></doc>
