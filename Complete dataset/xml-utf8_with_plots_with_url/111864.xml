<plot>Comedy Tonight was a televised launching pad for up-and-coming (at the time) comedians, as well as a few seasoned "name" guests who would appear. The show, hosted by Bill Boggs, was shot in New York and ran for just over one year. The comedians would get a (very) short time in which to present their material, often-times using their lack of proper stage-time as part of their routine to rub at the producers. Amongst the many names who have graced the stage include Sinbad, Eric Boogosian, Rita Rudner, Uncle Floyd &amp; Oogie, Yakov Smirnoff, and many others - many of whom would sometimes upstage the relatively dry Bill Boggs. Snippets of old-time comedy film scenes would be shown in between the sketches and commercial breaks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111864</url></doc>
