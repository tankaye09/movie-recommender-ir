<plot>When a scion of LA industry dies in the arms of a prostitute who won't hand him his heart tablets, his three squabbling adult children head for a weekend at the family's remote, high-desert cabin to sort out the estate. Ethan, the ambitious, cruel eldest brings his mousy wife Jackie. The ne'er-do-well brother Dennis, with an alcoholic past and big gambling debts, brings his new girlfriend, Zoey. The youngest, Audrey, seems detached. At a rural gas station, Dennis rescues a woman from an abusive boyfriend, and he invites her to stay with them. She's Nichol, and she looks vaguely familiar. Who's aligned with whom in the struggle for money and control? Who's weak, who's strong?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657203</url></doc>
