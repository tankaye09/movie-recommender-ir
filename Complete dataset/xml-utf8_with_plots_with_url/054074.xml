<plot>Rahul lives a wealthy lifestyle in Mumbai along with his dad, Banwarilal Ansimal and mom, and is a big disappointment to his parents. They want him to get married, he refuses, and gets grounded. Shortly thereafter, Banwarilal finds out Rahul has managed to escape, and launches a search for him. A few months later, Rahul telephones his mother, that he is alive and well, and has found a sweetheart, Nikita, who he wants to marry. His mother accepts this and wants him to return home immediately. Neither know that Banwarilal does not approve of his son choosing a bride on his own, and has already made arrangements with his wealthy Himachal Pradesh-based childhood friend, Jaalan, for Rahul's marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054074</url></doc>
