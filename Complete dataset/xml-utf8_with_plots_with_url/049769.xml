<plot>A magnificent panoramic view of the great Electric Tower and its surroundings at the Pan-American Exposition. In the first part of the picture a daylight view is given. Gradually twilight comes, and as darkness sets in, the myriads of incandescent lights on the structure break into a soft glow. Brighter and brighter they become until the spectacle stands forth in the splendor that has amazed the people of the whole world. This film, while it is in part a result of photographic manipulation, includes a large number of actual exposures at night; this being, we believe, the first moving picture ever made by means of time exposures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049769</url></doc>
