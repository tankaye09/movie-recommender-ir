<plot>"Cease To Exist" explores the music motive to the Manson murders and uncovers Charles Manson's relationship with Beach Boys' drummer Dennis Wilson and record producer Terry Melcher. Wilson met Charlie through two hitchhikers whom he had picked up, and for the next six months Charlie and his 'Family' lived in Wilson's home. It was here that Wilson introduced Manson to Terry Melcher and the two became fascinated with Manson's musical abilities, prophetic image and band of hedonistic young worshipers. Manson prevailed upon his new celebrity friends to produce an album that would send other Artist's packing. After a few wrecked cars, medical expenses and $100,000 lost, Dennis kicked Manson and the family off his property. On top of that, The Beach Boy's took a song Manson wrote for them entitled "Cease to Exist" and changed the lyrics, the title, and did not credit a furious Manson. After Wilson and Melcher allegedly reneged on a record deal, Manson sought revenge. After numerous threats, Melcher moved out of his and rented it to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. So what is now known as the Manson Family murders actually has little to do with the popular 'Helter Skelter' motive; but rather, the 'music motive.' The infamous murders on August 9th 1969, can be perceived as a warning sign sent by Manson and Co. to Wilson and Melcher.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097514</url></doc>
