<plot>The Ninja Turtles finally get to go to the surface and try out their Ninja moves by defending the weak. When suddenly they run smack-dab into a street gang known as the Purple Dragons. Not only that, but they are ambushed by Foot Ninjas and small robots with sharp teeth called Mousers, built by that naive, semi-mad scientist Baxter Stockman. The turtles must defeat these enemies, shut down Stocktronics Labs, while making their way from the streets of New York to the Foot's hideout. The turtles must brave the streets, subway tunnels, subway cars, a bridge, the top of a truck, even the vast underground world where Foot scientists turned peaceful humans into bloodthirsty mutant monsters. When the turtles arrive at the Foot compound, they must go up against the leader of the Purple Dragons. 7'2, 500 pound Hun. Not to mention an array of Foot Elite Ninjas and invisible Foot Tech Ninjas, as well as the head of the Foot, as well as the entire criminal underground: The Shredder. Will our lean green heroes be able to defeat the enemy, snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, right every wrong, and be home in time for pizza and "American Gladiators"?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?533669</url></doc>
