<plot>Unemployed friends Doka and Bonza haven't managed to gain a foothold in the new economic climate. They liven up their inactivity with infantile distractions. Big shots from the former regime have meanwhile built up new careers, having caught the crest of the privatization wave. Adopting the appropriate cynicism and employing mafia tactics, they line their pockets and reinforce their position. Matanov and Tsonchev are contenders as intermediaries in the sale of an ironworks in Sinistra, which a Greek client has his eye on. Both want to get as much as possible out of this transaction, even at the cost of doing away with the competition. The rivals assign trustworthy consultants to engineer the venture, who then appoint compromised flunkies to get the job done. In a wholly random selection, the role of anonymous pawns is entrusted to Doka and Bonza. With a lucrative reward in their sights, they set off for Sinistra, unaware of what they are getting themselves into.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453134</url></doc>
