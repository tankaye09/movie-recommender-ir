<plot>One sees the fisherman hauling a huge net containing tons of fish of every description. The climax is reached when the men begin removing the fish. Thousands of sea gulls which are hovering about begin a mad fight for the small fish which always drop from the net before the entire catch is landed on the deck of the tug. Some of the gulls fly down upon the deck of the tug, keeping the fishermen busy beating them off with sticks so as to prevent them stealing the large and more valuable fish. At least 5,000 seagulls can be seen as they fly about and give and fight for the fish. Our photographer was obliged to wait weeks for an opportunity to make this picture, as it is only on rare occasions that the atmosphere at the Farralone Islands is not laden with fog. It is almost safe to say that this wonderful picture will never again be secured on an animated picture film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?196356</url></doc>
