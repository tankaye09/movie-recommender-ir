<plot>City educated and peace-loving Arjun would love to have the Thakur, his brother and the rest of the villagers to live and harmony. Arjun's peace-loving dreams are shattered when his brother is killed, his sister Shanta is raped and killed in front of the village, and he himself is beaten up and tied to a tree and left for dead. Villagers who empathize with dacaits rescue him, and take him to their hideout, and he meets thugs and robbers who were his childhood friends, who have turned into outlaws due to the sufferings inflicted on them by Thakur and his men. Arjun has a choice now, either go on trusting the corrupt village police; or join the gang of dacaits and avenge the death of his sister and brother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123759</url></doc>
