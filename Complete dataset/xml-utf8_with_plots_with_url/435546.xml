<plot>Players is a new 1/2-hour show offering an in-depth look at the artists who built and continue to build the foundation for today's top selling form of pop music. Artists like Ludacris defined themselves as true icons by contributing to the evolution of a musical genre that only barely existed 15 years ago. Adopting a visual and narrative aesthetic reflecting this musical genre, Players will take viewers from the streets and neighborhoods where artists first found their inspiration to the extravagant lifestyles they live today. Utilizing gritty, raw and real coverage we will follow Ludacris through his daily routines, the show will present itself as a fly-on-the-wall perspective on the unique world of Hip Hop. The recording studio, the video shoot, the nationwide tour, the awards shows and everywhere in between# viewers will witness artists in their true environment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435546</url></doc>
