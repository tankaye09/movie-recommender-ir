<plot>Aude, Laura, Mélanie, Joe, Jordi and Patrick are six teenagers who spend all their spare time on the ice rink. The three boys are playing ice hockey; the girls turn in circles and don't stop talking. They make their first moves in the matter of love. Everyone of them has developed his own personal manner in how to approach and conquer his object of desire. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they don't.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?627429</url></doc>
