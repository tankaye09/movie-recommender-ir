<plot>This epic-length comedy-drama tells the story of 14-year-old Ben Fries, who has composed a six-hour video epic about the life of Rimbaud (pronounced "Rambo"), the beloved movie action hero, consisting of over two-hundred episodes and weekend after weekend of shooting and editing mountains of footage. Ben has an entourage of college students who follow his every word and his every idea. Timmy Hause, a child prodigy artist, who became known for his remarkable representations of figures like Dostoyevsky, St. Benedict and others, begins a series of drawings in all media about Ben Fries-and soon after, Ben destroys his video epic, disappearing at a Venezuela soccer camp to be presumed dead. College roommates and "entourage members" Nikki and Julian, who have been involved with Ben and Timmy respectively, attempt to put together the pieces of the puzzle behind Ben's disappearance whilst trying to ward off (only to succumb to) the malicious agenda of the malevolent student filmmaker Rick Algarosa, who always expressed ill will for Ben Fries and the Rimbaud epic. Algarosa plots to corrupt all former members of the tight-knit Ben Fries followers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065028</url></doc>
