<plot>The Miller family is in turmoil, with members arguing and fighting with each other. Mom finally figures out that all the family's problems can be traced directly to "bad management". She concludes that the way to solve the problem is to run the family like a corporation, with her and Dad as the CEOs and the children as the employees, and weekly meetings where the children will be told exactly what their duties are and how to do them. The kids, as all good children of course will do, think that being turned into soulless corporate drones is a wonderful idea and much better than having their own thoughts, opinions and input on family matters, and everyone naturally lives happily ever after.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188821</url></doc>
