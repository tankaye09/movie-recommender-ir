<plot>International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by the UN to provide justice to victims of war crimes which were committed during nineties, and to help the reconciliation process in the region. Eleven years and more than 830 million dollars later, the film looks at the situation in two Bosnian communities, Prijedor and Konjic. Has the ICTY achieved what it was set up to do or was it just and expensive legal experiment?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282753</url></doc>
