<plot>This amusing short is set in a diner. Frank is taking his buddy to the airport. Tommy is flying out to see his girlfriend, and Frank proceeds to give him hilarious tips about how to deal with women. He also plants seeds of doubt in Tommy's mind-- doubt that the girl cares as much for him as he for her. This is a hilarious look at male camaraderie.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402026</url></doc>
