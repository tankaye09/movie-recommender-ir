<plot>An early television program originally broadcast on the old DuMont Television Network. The series ran from 1953 to 1956. The program, produced and distributed from Cincinnati, aired Monday at 10:45 PM on most DuMont affiliates until July of 1953, when it moved to Tuesdays at 9:30. Originally called Girl Alone, the program featured performer Dotty Mack lip syncing and dancing to popular 1950s songs. The name of the program was changed to The Dotty Mack Show in the summer of 1953 when she was joined by male performers. The series moved to ABC in August of 1953, where it remained until being canceled in September of 1956.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554110</url></doc>
