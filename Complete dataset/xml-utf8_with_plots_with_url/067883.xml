<plot>"The Love Affair - The Computer and ist User!" is the third film in a little series of documentaries of "things" which changed the world. It is not a film about computers. It is an event. A multimedia event, which for the first time on television affords the computer the opportunity to reflect upon and study its "user". Indeed, in our film the computer studies its operator. Who is dependent on whom? The approach to this question is direct and innovative. A new graphic user interface was developed especially for the film, enabling us to cascade down the pull-down menus, leap through electronic files and prevent (almost) any crash. The innermost insights of an intimate relationship. Voyeuristic images of the computer and its user.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067883</url></doc>
