<plot>Scots' father was a gambler and was in deep with the local mob. After his tragic, yet supposedly "accidental" death, Scot, with his 3 childhood friends Carlos, Berry, and RJ, is left to pay off his dad's debt. The story takes place on their first job for a man named Mr. Fratelli, and follows them through their trails of right and wrong and an instinct to survive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022253</url></doc>
