<plot>Michelle Conrad and her twin brother play a tournament of a board game called "Squid-Tac-Toad". During the tie-breaking match, she distracts her brother and cheats in order to win. While justifying her actions to herself, a toy spaceship and 4 penguins come to life and draft her on a mission to save the Bandicoot King at Space Base Bullamanka. Once there, she must compete in a life-size version of Squid-Tac-Toad (with her penguin compatriots as pieces) and win, or the Bandicoot King and the penguins will be sent through "The Gurgler" to their doom.</plot><plot>Michelle Conrad and her twin brother play a tournament of a board game called "Squid-Tac-Toad".
