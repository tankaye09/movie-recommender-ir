<plot>This is the true story behind the largest industrial merger of all time. In 1998, German Daimler Benz merged with the all American Chrysler corporation. The cultural clashes and market fallout that followed, rocked the industry. Using dramatic reconstructions, archive and access to many key corporate figures who had never spoken publicly before on this subject, the film tells the inside story behind the merger and assesses its impact on the industry today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366249</url></doc>
