<plot>This picture is replete with humor and novel features. It is a custom that has been extant in this city for years. We photographed the pageant just as it took place on New Year's Day, 1902. The costumes of those who paraded with the Fancy Dress Clubs were gorgeous in the extreme. The regalia of Kings and Queens of different nations are represented. The materials in the costumes are light in color and elaborate in trimmings and make-up. Pages attired in fancy dress of various historical periods carry the trains of their lords and ladies, and some of the kings require the services of forty attendants to be able to move. The make-up of some of the comic groups is the most grotesque ever seen. The scene is also replete with dancing, cakewalks, etc., partaken of in the street while the pageant is moving. This gives the entire scene a great air of novelty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394346</url></doc>
