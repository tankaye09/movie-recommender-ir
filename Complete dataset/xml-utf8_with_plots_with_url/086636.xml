<plot>A member of the Bunco squad introduces the Case of the Gullible Woodpecker. It seems that Woody wins a pot full of dough that con man Buzz Buzzard notices and sets his sights on stealing. He leads Woody on a phony treasure hunt on Cataloni Island where all the materials Woody needs to continue the hunt (treasure maps, fire extinguishers, toll bridges, etc.) cost him a bundle. Finally, Woody catches on that he was swindled and gives chase, eventually getting his money back, and closing the case.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086636</url></doc>
