This is a reflection on racism, prejudice, memory of slavery in France in the 21st century, while the overseas French territories are living an unknown before crisis and while Paris is inaugurating an important monument in the memory of the general Dumas, replacing the statue that had been destroyed during world war II.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?323604</url></doc>
