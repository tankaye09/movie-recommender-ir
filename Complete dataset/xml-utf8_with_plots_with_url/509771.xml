<plot>A police car is in hot pursuit of Angry Kid, who speeds down the street on his bicycle, his little sister (or a doll) strapped on behind him. As the Kid eludes the coppers, it becomes a matter of pride that they catch him, to avoid being a laughingstock at the station house. Somehow the Kid gets hold of a police radio, taunting his Javert over the airwaves. Will the boys in blue catch the kid with the orange hair?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509771</url></doc>
