<plot>Radha lives a poor lifestyle in a small town in India along with her brother, Shankar, who is a Hindu Priest (Pandit), and makes a living driving a truck. Shankar has a close friend in Sher Khan (Pathaan), who they treat as their brother. Both men are honest and assist the Police in apprehending stolen items and drugs much to the chagrin of underworld madam, Salma, and her henchmen Birju and Ramzan. They tamper with Shankar's truck, leading to an accident in which he loses his left leg, placing the trio in even more financial hardship. Their woes worsen when Sher is attacked, loses a lot of blood, and is hospitalized. Sher eventually survives with Shankar's assistance. Not satisfied with this outcome, Salma and her men now concoct a devious plan to do away with both Shankar and Sher once and for all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421549</url></doc>
