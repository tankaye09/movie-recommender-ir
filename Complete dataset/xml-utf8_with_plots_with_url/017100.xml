<plot>See Stuart Kincaid and his compulsion to make a feature film on NO budget. he rallies a hodge-podge collection of personalities consisting of old punks, working thespians, blue-collars, and defense contractors to get the job done. They utilize every resource in daily life to complete the sequel to 'Repo Man' true to the DIY (Do It Yourself) philosophy and spirit of punk rock. A TEXAS TALE OF TREASON IS: A documentary on how to shoot a feature film with nothing, o how NOT to shoot a feature with nothing. A portrait of working 30-40 something punk rockers who refuse to bow to "the man". A definition of "PUNK film-making'. Fusing the DIY philosophy and spirit of old hardcore with no-budget movie-making. Venture deep into the weird as the day-jobbing cast and crew clash, fail, and triumph. Taking the reins of their own destiny, against all odds....even in the face of treason. Featuring interviews with cast and crew of "Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday". Cameos by punk rockers, T. Tex Edwards (Nervebreakers), Gregg Turner (The Angry Samoans), Billy Atwell (Th'Inbred), Ed Ivey (The Rhythm Pigs), Don Foote (Loco Gringos), Davy Jones and Jeff Smith (The Hickoids), and Dave Woodard (Billyclub).
