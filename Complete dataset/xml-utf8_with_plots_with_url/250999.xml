<plot>Shown as a saturday night summer series on Danish television in 1974, "Hvad skal man tro?" was an entertaining viewer-oriented quiz show hosted by ever-popular Otto Leisner. Each episode contained seven or so stories, told in pictures or by a studio guest, of which three were lies. The viewers were invited to select the three stories they distrusted and send them on a postcard to win prizes (a color television was the main prize). Example stories include those of a Swiss cow-skiing instructor, a sound wave machine to blast down walls with, and a small wind machine to help sail boats make wind even when there isn't any.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250999</url></doc>
