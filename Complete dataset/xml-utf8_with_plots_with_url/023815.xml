<plot>We all want to be independent-to think for ourselves, to live on our own, to have our own dreams. Virginia Matthews has found her independence at 63. And now she's about to be adopted. Virginia survived years of sexual and mental abuse at the hands of her own mother, and years of misdiagnosis by a medical community that incorrectly labeled her 'mentally retarded' and isolated her both physically and psychologically with a myriad of drugs -drugs improperly prescribed for conditions that didn't even exist. The story of Virginia proves that a person can overcome a label. Can overcome their own handicaps. Can love and be loved. From the outside this new family might look like the poster children for dysfunctional But Virginia, Hilary, Ben and others prove that humor, charm and sincerity can be shared to create a family more filled with love than the blood ties we're born with. Meet survivors. Meet this family. Meet Virginia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023815</url></doc>
