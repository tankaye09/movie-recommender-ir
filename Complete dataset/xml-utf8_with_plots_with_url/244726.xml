<plot>A young tutor, miss Chen, is sent to home school in a dysfunctional household head by a wealthy patriarch. She befriends his ambulatory disabled young daughter, Ming Chu, and becomes embroiled in her struggle to walk again.  She also has problems, and with her angst ridden artist brother, they search for their birth mother and their cruel spoiled half-brother. Meanwhile at home, the tutor's own fellow border house mates (a single mother Shen Chiu Meng  and her nightclub singer son Chiang Hui) also possess guarded secrets.  These secrets gradually surface as Chen unwittingly becomes a catalyst for those in her life as they all converge towards the bridging of deep rooted familial gaps and resolving past estrangements.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?244726</url></doc>
