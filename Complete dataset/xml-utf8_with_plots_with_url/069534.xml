<plot>Big Green Lies is a show dedicated to cutting through all of the myths of green living and figuring out what really helps the environment. For example, is it really better to drive a Prius versus buying a used car? Or do cloth diapers make that much difference to the environment? The crew of Big Green Lies tackles these questions and more by performing experiments and talking to experts and consumers. In the first episode, Big Green Lies looks at these environmental questions: Is organic food really that much better? Should everyone drive a Prius? Is air quality better indoors or outdoors? Should we be sweating over disposable diapers?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069534</url></doc>
