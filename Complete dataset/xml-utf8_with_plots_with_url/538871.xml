<plot>Rattled by the panic and chaos of the modern world two strangers from opposite ends of the social spectrum meet in a hotel on the worst day of their lives. Daniel (Sam Hull), an up and coming businessman, has lost his home, his marriage and soon his job. He has holed up in a room at the hotel refusing to directly address the problems he faces. He has only a few random items with him among them a broken accordion. When things look their worst, a hotel maid named Sid (Orianna Herrman), a recently released mental patient who never speaks enters the room and impulsively begins to make beautiful music with the accordion, giving Daniel the only relief he has felt in days.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?538871</url></doc>
