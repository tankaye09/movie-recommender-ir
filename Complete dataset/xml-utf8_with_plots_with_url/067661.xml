<plot>Beyond the Dream is the inspiring and biographical documentary of legendary professional surfer, Joey Buran. It traces his humble origins from Carlsbad, California to his rise as one of the sports' greatest athletes. The film follows Buran's journey to winning the highly coveted Pipeline Master's Championship in 1984, which left him unfulfilled, leading to depression and a suicide attempt. From fame to obscurity, through tribulations and trials, an unbelievable comeback a decade later, and becoming a pastor, it is a life-changing story that led to Buran's ultimate discovery for true purpose in his life."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067661</url></doc>
