Indira grows up to be a beauty and is sought by three suitors Raj (Raj Kapoor), Kundan (Al Nasir), and Ramesh (Suresh).

Indira does not appreciate this and refuses to marry Ramesh. Raj speaks of his love with Rani, and Rani warns him that Indira is to marry Ramesh, but also has an on-going affair with his brother Kundan. Who does Indira really love?
