<plot>Older Women / Younger Men is a one-hour documentary that looks at the growing phenomenon of women dating and in many cases marrying much younger men. From the "cougar" (a predator tracking its young prey at the local bar) to women making life-long commitments to their younger partners much to the dismay of family and strangers, we examine the trials and uncertainties of these taboo relationships. Keeping the company of someone younger isn't just for men anymore!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409654</url></doc>
