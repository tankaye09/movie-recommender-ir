<plot>A giant statue of the letter "E" arrives in the park. One man sees it as "B"; they are preparing to cart him off to the looney bin when a doctor arrives and determines the man needs glasses. Then the king arrives; he also sees "B". He tries on the glasses, sees "E", and pins a medal on the doctor then has his goon squad come and bash on everyone's head until they too see "B".</plot><plot>A giant statue of the letter "E" arrives in the park.
