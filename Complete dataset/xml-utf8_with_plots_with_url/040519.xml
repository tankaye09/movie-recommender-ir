<plot>Ashok R. Tilak lives in Dinkapur with his widowed mother, and a servant named Bahadur. He travels to another town on a business trip to buy several acres of grape-bearing trees, with Bahadur accompanying him. Although this is his first trip to this town, however, everyone appears to know him and Bahadur, including the Ticket Checker at the Railway Station, the taxi-driver, the Hotel Manager, local Police Inspector Sinha, a Jeweler named Chhedilal and his assistant Mansoor, and to top it all a woman named Sudha claims that she is his wife, and another woman named Tanu claims that she is his sister-in-law, while a third one named Alka claims that she is his mistress. All's not well for Bahadur either for he bears the brunt of this confusion when he finds out that he has a wife named Prema; a normally sane boss, who keeps on sniffing snuff and smoking alternatively, and who yells and slaps him frequently. After a nightmarish night, the hapless duo decide they have had enough and decide to return home, only to have the police arrest them for theft of a diamond necklace. Watch what happens when the truth is hilariously revealed at the Police Station of this town that has never these comedy of errors - ever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040519</url></doc>
