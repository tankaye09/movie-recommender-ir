<plot>Here we show a familiar scene. A number of boys are swimming in a private lake, when the owner comes along and chases them. They worry him because they can swim all around him and although he has a bough of a tree he cannot reach them. They come up behind him on the rock on which he is standing and dive overboard, but the farmer cannot catch them and finally gives up in despair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?189950</url></doc>
