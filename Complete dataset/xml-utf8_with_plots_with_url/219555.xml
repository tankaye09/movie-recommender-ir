<plot>Mei Chi, an amnesiac following a car accident, deserts her family to hook with up Ah-Liang, a taxi-driver by day and pirate CD salesman by night; Fortune-teller Ren appears on the doorstep of a lotto store owner looking for more than just a place to stay; A sexy bar owner mocks the amorous advances of an impotent musician manqu√© driving him to seek solace in alcohol. An electrifying black comedy that celebrates the strength of women and taps beneath the veneer of relationships to unveil the honest truth. Upbeat and contemporary in tone, Princess in Wonder is an exploration of the elusive space between men and women and the connection between past, present and future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219555</url></doc>
