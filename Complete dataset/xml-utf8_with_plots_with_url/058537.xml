<plot>This series tells the true stories that would be any traveler's worst nightmare - when moments of madness or desperation in paradise becomes a journey into hell that ends up in prison abroad. Through graphic dramatic reconstruction each film tells the story of someone who's been arrested and thrown into a foreign prison. Sometimes for smuggling drugs. Sometimes for falling foul of local corrupt policemen. Sometimes for being duped into carrying illegal goods through customs. In all cases the films follow the sinking sense of horror from the build up to the moment of arrest, their journey through an incomprehensible legal process, the coming to terms with the details of life in a hellhole jail, and the devastating fall out for their family and friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058537</url></doc>
