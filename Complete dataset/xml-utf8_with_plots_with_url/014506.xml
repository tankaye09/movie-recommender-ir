<plot>A rather aged maid is seen arranging to have her picture taken. The photographer places her in a chair and proceeds to focus the camera on her. When he puts his head under the focusing cloth, she, wishing to see what he is doing, takes a peep into the lens and gets a puff of flour for her trouble. The photographer pushes her back into the chair, and as he is about to take the picture, the camera explodes, and shoots the old maid against the wall, where she sticks. The photographer in attempting to rescue her, pulls off both her legs. He throws the legs at her in a fit of madness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014506</url></doc>
