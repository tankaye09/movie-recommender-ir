<plot>Louise, a 25-year-old underwriter, staves off the boredom of insurance speak in her imagined Oprah Winfrey interviews while driving home in celebrity-infested Los Angeles, underscoring both her latent ambition and the cracks in her self-confidence as she faces the difficulties of caring for her mentally ill mother, May. Louise's mother provides a darkly comic counterpoint, as she becomes threatened by Catherine, Louise's self-possessed boss. Catherine admires Louise's trailblazing approach, watching with pride as she faces down arrogant movie moguls and charms the old money board of directors without a hint of vanity. But Catherine is suddenly taken ill and reaches out to her protégée, Louise, as a potential business heir, pushing her up the rungs of the corporate ladder even as May seems to hold her daughter down. The comic and heart-felt struggle that lies at the root of this unconventional love triangle culminates in a brawl with May landing a fist to Catherine's eye! But thanks to Louise's plucky resilience and her gigantic dreaming heart these comic/tragic circumstances somehow come up on the other side of joy -- just over the softly lit horizon of serendipity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401490</url></doc>
