<plot>CHARCOAL is based on a real event that occurred to one ethnic family the week of September 11, 2001. They are the quirky, ethnic looking, artistic family, in an All-American, conservative, Queens neighborhood. They are a cross between the families in "The Royal Tennenbaums" and "Hotel New Hampshire." Simply stated, they are different enough to arouse suspicion in the early days following September 11th from their neighbors, many of whom looked upon the family as sordid even before then. The film takes us on a surreal journey through this artistic family's home and their family barbecue. This innocent barbecue turns into an incendiary situation when disgruntled neighbors decide to call the police and fire department because of the smoke. Unbeknownst to the family and to most New York City residents, it is illegal to burn wood in a barbecue within New York City limits. Riding the wave of post September 11th xenophobia, a group of neighbors decide to channel their anger and fears at this slightly subversive family. The police and the fire department, already jarred from the recent events, wind up caught in the middle of a smoking, technically illegal fire, angry neighbors, and a besieged family who just wanted to grill some sausages.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100061</url></doc>
