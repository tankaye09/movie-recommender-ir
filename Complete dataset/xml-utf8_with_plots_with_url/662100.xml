<plot>After nearly 40 years of false imprisonment, cruel scientific testing and denial by the US government, Agent X is finally a free man again. Due to circumstances still under federal investigation, Agent X escaped his Los Angeles cell. Looking for answers about what happened to his family and his previous life, he must now backtrack over forty years - becoming reacquainted with a world in which he is officially dead and with a government that denies his very existence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662100</url></doc>
