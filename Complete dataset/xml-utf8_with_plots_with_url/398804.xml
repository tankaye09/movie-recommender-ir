<plot>"No Way To Heaven" begins on a remote island in Southeast Asia. There, Fritz Joss, a young man from the Swiss mountains has decided to stop eating - once and for all. He plans to find sustenance in pure (sun-)light by applying what is known as the "21-day process". In a manner at once relaxed and almost child-like in its naivety, Fritz sets off on his endeavour, but the planned conversion to "breatharianism" is much more difficult than anticipated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398804</url></doc>
