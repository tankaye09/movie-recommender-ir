<plot>Jerry Forbes is a big-time lawyer who gets divorced and gives up his position at a New York City firm to move back to his home town of Columbia, Ohio. There, he struggles to raise his son, 15-year-old Mark, while helping his father, Phil, keep the family drugstore afloat. Meanwhile, he meets Laura, his old high-school flame who's now a local disc jockey. The two rekindle their relationship despite that fact that she is married to Charlie, Jerry's old pal, who is now the high-school football coach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409391</url></doc>
