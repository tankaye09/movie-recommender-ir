<plot>A raw and honest portrait of a side of Denmark not seen by many. The documentary series features teenagers who share shocking experiences from their childhood. These 13-15 year old kids want so badly to put their conflicts behind them and change their destiny. We follow them through the crisis where it can be hard to grasp how they manage to deal with their problems and get on with their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200222</url></doc>
