<plot>An American flag acts as a stake in the race, and is placed in the center of the ice. The yachts with their great white sails are seen running toward and rounding the stake. They go through some very remarkable manoeuvres. One yacht nearly capsizes. At this particular race it is estimated that some of the yachts made as high as forty miles an hour. The scene gives a remarkably good idea to anyone not acquainted with ice yachting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255732</url></doc>
