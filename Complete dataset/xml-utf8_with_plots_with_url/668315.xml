<plot>A young man steals an erotic woodblock print from a book store. The shop-owner has watched him and consequently a wild pursuit begins. Eventually the young man slips inside a mysterious building. When he runs up the stairs he falls. A little girl appears and takes the woodblock print away from him, vanishing as she walks down a long and dark aisle. There are rooms on both sides of the aisle. Out of curiosity the young man opens the sliding door to the first room and peeps inside. What he does not know is that he was expected... The Japanese word "Yuwaku" means "seduction". Without being pornographic, "Yuwaku 2" tries to explore the sexual aspects of seduction. Each room of the mysterious house features another beautifully arranged erotic scene. And the very last room holds a fascinating surprise. Esthetically photographed, the whole movie itself seems to be one giant colourful Japanese woodblock print.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?668315</url></doc>
