While eating some food, they are taunted and physically assaulted by Kallu Dada, a physical altercation ensues, Raja wins and becomes the local uncrowned underworld don, and both make a living collecting Hafta (weekly bribes) from shopkeepers and local businesses. He starts drinking alcohol and frequents the bar run by local belle Rasili. Raja meets with Laxmi Rao and is attracted to her, he comes to her assistance when her dad, Mohan, passes away, by helping to cremate him; he comes to her aid again when Kallu and his goons attempt to sexually molest her; and when the municipality tear down her shanty hut, he decides to let her live with him. Due to her influence, he gives up his bad habits and decides to go straight. Things go well, so much so that both get ready to get married to each other in a simple temple ceremony organized by the community. On the wedding day, things spiral out of control when a Professor, an old beau of Laxmi, shows up, proposing marriage to her on one hand, while an alcohol-induced Raja is arrested and held for killing Kallu.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442321</url></doc>
