<plot>Ricky is the new kid in Pumpkin Hollow looking to buy a car from the strange Mr. Damoan, but it seems like everyone in town fears that car and it's past. Nightwalkers is three tales of revenge from the grave as told by the town historian. Chapter One: The Initiation - When a fraternity prank goes terribly wrong, see what three friends will do to save their own skin as the person they pull the prank on suffers to death and they bury him without telling anyone. But he returns to seek revenge along with a zombie of another man who lived in an abandoned old house that the fraternity brothers played their prank on as this man took his own life. Chapter Two: The Family Friend - See what happens when three drug smuggling punks take a wrong turn into a farming community with a dark secret as the owners there tell their daughter about a legend of their family member who died and became their scarecrow. The punks break into their house and kills all of them and the legend awakens. Chapter Three: Nia: Undying Love - Nia promises to love her boyfriend Sean forever. But Sean is drinking and caring less about Nia while they are both in his car. Nia gets out of his car and after a tragic accident Nia plans to keep her promise even from beyond the grave. Will Pumpkin Hollow claim another soul? Or will Ricky see through Mr. Damoan's plans to get out of town fast? Like the town folks say, "Don't get caught in Pumpkin Hollow at night!"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396573</url></doc>
