<plot>This film was taken at the time of the arrival of King Edward and the Royal part at Kensington. The film shows the arrival of His Majesty in company with Lord Provost of Edenburgh, Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Earl and Countess Mar, Countess of Hopetown, Lord and Lady Scott, Victor and Lady Cavendish, the Earl of Roseberry, Duke Montrose, General Chapman, Captain Anderson, and the Earl of Leven. More excellent portraits were procured of all the Royal party, and His Majesty King Edward, as they passed within twenty feet of the camera. This is absolutely the best moving picture procured of King Edward.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165880</url></doc>
