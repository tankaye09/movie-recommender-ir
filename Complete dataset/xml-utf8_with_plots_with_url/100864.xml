<plot>Chastity is a troubled young woman who yearns for happiness, but has no idea which road leads there. While she craves the stability of domestic life, she finds herself running yet again. She encounters a series of people who, like her, are not who they seem. Although each of them offers something of themselves to her, she is not able to accept the gestures. Once she does reach out for love, her behavior is so erratic as to seem to deny redemption. Yet one extraordinary man accepts her, bleeding wounds and all, because he has a few of his own. Chastity's struggle is a poignant illustration of the sometimes Sisyphean task of personal growth and change, and the immutablity of that desire in the self-aware.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100864</url></doc>
