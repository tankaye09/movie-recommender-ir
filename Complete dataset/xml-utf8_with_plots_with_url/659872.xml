<plot>The 'Woman From The East' depicts the plight of a poor Indian woman, who is marketed as an animal and is made alien right in her own mother land, India. Paala Singh, a small farmer from a village in Punjab, who is about 65, doesn't have a son from his first wife. His lust for a son tempts him to sell his buffalo and with the same money to purchase a girl to have a son from. 'Ganga' the protagonist of 'Woman From The East', belongs to a poor family from Bihar. She has lost her own mother and is living with her father and step mother. Despite acute poverty her father is an addict. Ganga is uprooted and sent to Punjab where she is called Pardesan - An Outsider. 'Woman From The East' is a disturbing tale of hard hitting realities in the underbelly of rural India. Every minute, every hour a woman is abused in some part of the globe. The film is a tribute to these women all over the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659872</url></doc>
