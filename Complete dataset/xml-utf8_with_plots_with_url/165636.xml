<plot>Edinburgh - world renowned for its stunning beauty as 'The Athens of the North' - unites the Old and the New in a city which spans a history both vibrant and entertaining. Take this tour through the closes and wynds of Edinburgh's Old Town and the magnificent Georgian avenues of the New Town with your guide Adam Lyal. At the height of its glory in the 18th century Edinburgh became one of the most influential cities in the western world with more geniuses living within the half square mile of its centre than any other place on earth. As this programme takes you through the city you will be introduced to the feast of fascinating stories which are woven into the fabric of Edinburgh's outstanding architecture. Adam Lyal was and is Edinburgh's most celebrated ghost. Hanged in 1811 for highway robbery this affable, amusing and ashen-faced phantom continues his exploration of the city's rich and glorious past, and can be seen nightly guiding visitors through the streets of Edinburgh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165636</url></doc>
