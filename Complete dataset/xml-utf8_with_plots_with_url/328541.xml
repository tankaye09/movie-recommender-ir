<plot>Long, long, ago on a far away Indian subcontinent lived a guy named Jaspal Singh (Adam Ghazi). As many of his comrades do yearly, he too came to America on student visa, a Turban on head, suitcase in hand and morals in check. His one goal - to study and make his parents proud. However, what awaited him in the land of opportunity was anything but traditional education. Instead, his on-the-street education leads him into situations that can only be summed up as a mix of "Coming to America" and "Animal House."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328541</url></doc>
