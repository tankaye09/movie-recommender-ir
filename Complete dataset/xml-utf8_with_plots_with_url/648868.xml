<plot>They call them 'Snow White and the 4 Weirdos' and they form a different kind of team. To qualify for the schools' football championship they're going to need something other than just hard training,for example a magic football would always be useful. The ball is a great guy and with his help, Mark and his friends will travel to the past where they'll get hold of a magic sports kit, have extraordinary adventures, escape from a dangerous threat and qualify! But on the day of the final itself they discover that the rival team now has hold of the pieces of the kit that got them through.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648868</url></doc>
