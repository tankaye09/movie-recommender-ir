<plot>The creators of Visas and Virtue (1997 Academy Award Winner, Best Live Action Short Film) have embarked on a new journey - the production of Independence Day. This dramatic film, set in a Japanese American internment camp during the World War II, explores one family's experience and examines the sacrifices and triumphs of those who endured and survived through preserverence, courage, and the all-American game of baseball. During World War II, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, ordering the forced removal and incarceration of all people of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast. These people, most of whom were American citizens, were taken from their homes and sent to "relocation" camps in desolate, isloated areas. These camps were surrounded by barb wire and guard towers. There were no charges, nor due process. The internment of 120,000 innocent people was a dark moment in the history of this country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130611</url></doc>
