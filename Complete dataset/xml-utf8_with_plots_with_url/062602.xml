<plot>Monsieur Renard, an independently wealthy man in 17th century France, prepares to go into business with his cousin, a jeweller who has has lost much of his work after being robbed by a highwayman. Renard agrees to become business partners on the condition that Du Bois' youngest daughter, Beauty, marries him. While travelling, Monsieur Du Bois is again attacked by a highwayman and brought to a château to recover under the care of Madame Bombec. Du Bois picks a rose from the château's gardens which angers Du Bois' mysterious host, the Beast as each flower that is picked from the garden shortens the Beast's life by one day. The Beast agrees to let Du Bois go on the condition that he gives the Beast the thing he loves the most- his daughter Beauty; and so Beauty goes to stay at the château where she finds magic in the most unlikely of places.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062602</url></doc>
