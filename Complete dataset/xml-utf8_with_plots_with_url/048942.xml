<plot>A group of young survivalist students are clustered among the rocks of a wilderness area, listening to the cautionary teachings of their instructor. On a trail just below them, a black Mercedes-Benz sedan rolls up. Four well-dressed men clamber out of the car, armed with shotgun and pistols. Opening the trunk, they roughly drag out Sonny. Wrists bound, they prop him into a sitting position against a boulder. Sonny pleads for his life to the group's boss, Don Vito, to no avail. As the youngsters gape in frightened disbelief, the hoods summarily execute Sonny with a bullet to his head. One of the girls screams, and the mobsters, knowing they've been made, start after them. Joey blasts the instructor dead with his shotgun. Panicked, the youngsters flee into the woods. By nightfall, they regain their composure and plot a war to survive. The predators become the prey, no match in their silk suits and designer shoes against a vengeful band determined to wipe them out by primitive means.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?048942</url></doc>
