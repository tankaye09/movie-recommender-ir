<plot>A monthly trip through Africa, made with just 500 euros, the savings of five years. The documentary begins with Ibrahima's painful parting from his family recorded live (Ibrahima's family didn't know that he was going to Spain until the last moment) and ends with Ibrahima joining in Barcelona his brother Birame, a graduate in Physics and Chemistry who works in Barcelona's University. A dangerous trip in which many find death at the hands of bandits or of the same mafias that control the illegal crossing of Ceuta's border. 'Ibrahima's trip' is the story of an intercontinental travel, but it is also a trip through Africa's history, in which the causes of African immigration to Europe are analyzed, immigration understood as a desperate escape from a continent degraded by colonialism and slavery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174348</url></doc>
