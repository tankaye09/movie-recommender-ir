<plot>A middle-aged woman refuses to admit that her relationship with her lover has ended, and continues to play out the fantasy that they will soon be married and going on their honeymoon. Her teenage son wonders why he never sees his mother's lover and begins to become concerned about her unusual behavior. Each day another gold fish in the aquarium - a gift from the ex-lover - dies... and each day the mother becomes ever more morose. As she hits rock bottom she begins to confuse her son with her ex - and in a moment of desperation passionately embraces the son who reels away in horror. Realizing what has happened and wanting to preserve the only relationship she really cares about she is forced to admit to herself that she has to put the past behind her and get on with her life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044189</url></doc>
