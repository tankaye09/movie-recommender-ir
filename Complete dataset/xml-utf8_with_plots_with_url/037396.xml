<plot>This is a very humorous picture, showing an old bachelor sewing a button on his trousers. His efforts to handle the needle and thread are very humorous, and his facial contortions are very amusing. Taken in large size, the head and shoulders filling the full field of the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037396</url></doc>
