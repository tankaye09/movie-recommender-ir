<plot>In the distance is seen a number of grey objects rapidly approaching, which, upon drawing closer, are recognized as a company of Boer cavalry.

Waving their sabres aloft on they come, so that the audience involuntarily makes an effort to move from their seats in order to avoid being trampled under the horses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100078</url></doc>
