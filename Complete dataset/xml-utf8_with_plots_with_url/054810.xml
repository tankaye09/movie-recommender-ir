<plot>Here is a picture that stirs the hearts of those who have looked forward to the day when their own baby puts forth his tiny foot and proudly steps out, supported by his indulgent father, and whose mother sees in him the future president. A picture indeed that arouses even the crusty old bachelor from his club dreams, and makes him wish for a sight such as this at his own fireside. A beautiful subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054810</url></doc>
