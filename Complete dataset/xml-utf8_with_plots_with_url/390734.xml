<plot>Native Wind tells the story of bringing sustainable and environmentally sound economic opportunity to Native People through wind power development on twelve Council On Utility Policy (COUP) reservations. Native Wind examines the grassroots movement that is driving the vision of COUP's Environmental Justice Demonstration Project Plan, a ten year effort to bring 3000 megawatts of wind energy to the reservations by 2015 and supply clean energy to participating tribes and cities creating a "tribal-city" partnership. The Plan is a template for the transition to a tribally controlled and economically sustainable homeland through the integration of wind energy into the existing national grid system, helping to create a "National Renewable Energy Grid". Throughout the film, we show COUP's efforts to push for the day when renewable energy production is the leading economic development opportunity and job creation engine on tribal lands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390734</url></doc>
