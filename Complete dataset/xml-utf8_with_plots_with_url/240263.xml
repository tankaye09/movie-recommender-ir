<plot>All men who see this picture will recognize the predicament they have been in when trying on a new collar. This man, in attempting to button his collar, soils it until it looks as if it had been through a threshing machine. Finally in despair, he destroys the collar, and throws it from him. This picture is very true to life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?240263</url></doc>
