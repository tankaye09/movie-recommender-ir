<plot>"Jones and his friend, both in a happy condition, go out for a ride. They meet a policeman, who objects to their manner of driving. Jones stands up on the seat and tells the officer to mind his own business. The officer jumps into the sleigh, grapples with Jones, and they fall out into a snowdrift. The friend drives off as fast as he can, tacking from one side of the road to the other. The cop pursues the sleigh and Jones escapes. As the sleigh disappears among the trees the cop gives up the chase and comes back after his helmet. Jones comes back also to argue the question, and the cop arrests him."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279176</url></doc>
