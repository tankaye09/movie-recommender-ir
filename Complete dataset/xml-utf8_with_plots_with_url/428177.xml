<plot>The finest and most modern train running between New York, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Washington and Chicago. This picture is truly a fine specimen of the art of motion photography. The picture was taken as this handsome train was running at a high rate of speed through the famous Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. The engine was specially built for speed and safety, and the cars are fully vestibuled. The upper part of the coaches is light, while the body of the train is dark. The windows are large French plate glass, so the exhibitor can readily see this train is an innovation on the railroad picture. When colored this picture is truly the most beautiful picture ever placed on a screen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?428177</url></doc>
