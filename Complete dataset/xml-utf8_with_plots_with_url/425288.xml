<plot>"By special arrangement with the Union Pacific Railroad Company, a private car and locomotive were placed at the disposal of our operator, for a period of nearly a month in the fall of 1900 [sic], for the purpose of obtaining panoramic views of the wildest and most picturesque portions of the American Rockies. The entire set is of exceptional value, the photographic work being well nigh perfect, and the composition of the pictures the most beautiful and impressive scenery in the United States. The viewpoint of the entire series is from the front of the locomotive running at highest speed."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425288</url></doc>
