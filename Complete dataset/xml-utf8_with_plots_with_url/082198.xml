<plot>John McManus dreams of a writing career and has qualified for the finals of a prestigious award. Leaving his wife working two jobs, he travels to Santa Barbara where he discovers that Catalina, the Hollywood star of his dreams is hosting the awards ceremony. His initial meeting with Catalina is clumsy and she dismisses him as another lecherous fan. After placing second in the competition, that evening John is surprisingly joined by a semi-drunk Catalina and, while he takes a phone call from his wife, Catalina swallows some pills and her inner demons surface. John eventually carries her back to her room and when Catalina reawakens lying in bed beside this fully clothed fan, John must make the biggest decision of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082198</url></doc>
