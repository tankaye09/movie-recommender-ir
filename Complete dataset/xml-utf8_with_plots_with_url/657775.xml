<plot>Hosted by Marc Summers, this quiz show from the Game Show Network is billed as "the only game show that turns 'knowledge into college.'" In the first two rounds, three contestants are asked general education questions that quiz them on knowledge commonly taught in the first grade through middle school. In the third round, the low scorer from the early game is eliminated, leaving the remaining pair of contestants to compete in answering a slate of tougher high school level questions. The winner then moves into the final round, where he or she will have have a chance to answer ten difficult questions to win the grand prize of $50,000 toward college tuition.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657775</url></doc>
