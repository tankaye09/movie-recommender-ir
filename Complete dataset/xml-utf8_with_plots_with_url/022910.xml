<plot>Oh, how are the mighty fallen. Here is a great Shakespearean actor on his uppers, actually broke; but he retains his valet and the two of them see the ghost walk. Ah, but then there is joy. What's that? It's a real ghost. Ah, what sorrow. Never mind. See this picture; something new, and we assure you if you carry our line of subjects you will never meet with the fate of this artist.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022910</url></doc>
