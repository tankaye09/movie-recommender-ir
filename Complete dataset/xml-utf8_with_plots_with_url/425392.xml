<plot>In this Film Mary is seen seated at a rough table in deep meditation. The angel appears at her side coming slowly over with outstretched arms and announcing that she had "found favor with God" and that she should give birth to a son whom she should call "Jesus." After blessing Mary, the angel, with outstretched wings, slowly departs and Mary disappears within her humble abode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425392</url></doc>
