<plot>Soo-hyeon, a student at Catholic Theological Seminary, decides to pull himself together and focus on his studies after breaking up from his girlfriend, Sua. One day he receives the news of his mother's illness, and with the permission from school authority, he spends a night at home. The next day, he departs for the train station but finds himself unable to take a school-bound train, heading instead for his ex-girlfriend, Sua. He is dispirited from Sua's adamant unwillingness to see him. Back in school, Soo-hyeon makes the difficult decision to quit studying, but is persuaded to go to a monastery for a spiritual purification retreat by the rector. As for Soo-hyeon, his tranquil adjustment to the life in monastery is abruptly brought to an end when he meets Helena at a mass, whose strikingly resemblance to Sua stirs up old emotions. He grows even more confused upon hearing the shocking news of Sua's sudden death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436821</url></doc>
