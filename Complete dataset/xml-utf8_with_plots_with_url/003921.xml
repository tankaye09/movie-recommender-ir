<plot>The 2006 Globe WCT Fiji witnessed Cloudbreak's perfection and a classic struggle for a spot on the podium amongst the world's top 45, where favorites were beaten down, rookies kicked ass and the twins nearly made it a brother-on-brother final. This event also marked Coach Cote's coming out party, with the Coach hosting The Tavamotu Challenge (the Quest for Chris Cote's Bar tab)-where the surfers staying on the two islands of Tavarua and Namotu go head-to-head in everything that possibly could be contested. Voted "The Sickest Event on the Planet" by the surfers themselves, this DVD is the next best thing to being there. Coach likes it, 10 points!!!!</plot><plot>The 2006 Globe WCT Fiji witnessed Cloudbreak's perfection and a classic struggle for a spot on the podium amongst the world's top 45, where favorites were beaten down, rookies kicked ass and the twins nearly made it a brother-on-brother final.
