<plot>Two fishermen sitting on a float are patiently waiting for a bite. Finally the long-looked-for bite takes place and on hauling the supposed fish to the surface they find it to be refuse of the river. They engage in a wordy argument and, grasping each other, fall into the water. Being expert swimmers it is an easy matter for them to emerge from the water backward, feet first. While doing so many ludicrous situations present themselves, all of which will be enjoyed by the looker on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011081</url></doc>
