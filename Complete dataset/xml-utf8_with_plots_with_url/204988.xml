<plot>This is a railroad panorama taken from the view point of the pilot of a locomotive, and is unusually interesting. It takes the passenger over the complete trip from the station at Monte Carlo, around the curves overlooking the harbor to the station in the city of Monaco. Many beautiful villas are passed enroute.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204988</url></doc>
