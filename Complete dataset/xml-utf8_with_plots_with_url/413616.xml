<plot>A little girl survives the massacre of her family by an evil lord who wanted to obtain a rare sword in the samurai family's possession. She is left for dead, having lost an eye and her right arm. She's raised by an aging swords-master, learns to talk like a rough samurai, and is trained to use the blade in order to pursue deadly vengeance. She is beautiful enough when dressed in feminine clothes to stir love in the heart of a male samurai - but her heart is for revenge only.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413616</url></doc>
