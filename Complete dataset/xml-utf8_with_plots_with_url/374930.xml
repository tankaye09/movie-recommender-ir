<plot>Rufus has never left the town of Yonderville. It's so far south it's not even on the map. With his Momma, his girlfriend Betty Jo (that he met at a family reunion) and best friend Dicky-Do, and his ten cent raise as a tobacco leaf taste tester, Rufus feels content never to leave and see the world beyond his town of 27 people. His mother already dealing with cancer. One day Betty Jo dumps him for a new man in town, Striker who has a real job flipping burgers. Trying to avenge himself, Rufus is beaten up by Striker until his sick mother comes in and beats up Striker. After a wild night of drinking, Momma wakes up and realizes her cancer is taking her over. She makes Rufus promise on her dying breath that he will do something she regretted not doing for her own mom - Find Jesus. Not sure who Jesus is, Rufus learns of a male supermodel named Jesus Mendoza and thinks that's the one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374930</url></doc>
