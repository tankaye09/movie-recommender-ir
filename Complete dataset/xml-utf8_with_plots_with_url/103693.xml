<plot>Indentured in a cramped, crowded, and confined world, Country Boy's life is endless toil. His sweat seeds a dream that his overbearing boss cannot stifle. Country Boy is a young Chinese dishwasher in a sub-terranean kitchen. His daily routine consists of work and sleep, in a room he shares with two other co-workers. One night while watching a travel program on television Country Boy begins to harbor a dream of living in New York City. He asks his Boss for a book on New York in order to quench his interest. The Boss, after much teasing, consents to Country boy's request. After much thought and introspection, including kindly advice from the house nurse and a railing at the hands of his co-workers, Country Boy decides to ask the Boss for permission to go to New York. The Boss responds to Country Boy's request with a violent outburst and sends Country Boy seemingly defeated back to his quarters. But hope still lingers in the one step Country Boy is about to make.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103693</url></doc>
