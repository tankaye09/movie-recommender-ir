<plot>The 1967 World Series was won by the heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals, who had won the Series in 1964, in seven games over the stout-hearted resistance of the Boston Red Sox, led by Triple Crown winner 'Carl Yastrzemski' (qv) and American League Cy Young Award winner 'Jim Lonborg' (qv). The seventh and deciding game was won by Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, who racked up his third win in the Series (and fifth-straight win going back to the '64 Series against the Yankees). Adding insult to injury, the amazing Gibson slugged two home runs in the seventh game, putting an end to the Red Sox's "Impossible Dream" season.</plot><plot>The 1967 World Series was won by the heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals, who had won the Series in 1964, in seven games over the stout-hearted resistance of the Boston Red Sox, led by Triple Crown winner 'Carl Yastrzemski' (qv) and American League Cy Young Award winner 'Jim Lonborg' (qv).
