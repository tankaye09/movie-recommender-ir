<plot>A girl has a heart that beats faster than normal and so loudly that it disturbs the neighbors and their dogs. They complain, and she explains that she has a bird's heart and that she thinks she's a bird trapped in a girl's body. They scoff and she flees, but she later calms down and returns home. As time passes the neighbors get used to the noise and eventually forget about it. And as everyone goes about their routine lives, the girl accepts her differences and becomes comfortable with herself, leading to an unusual transformation, and leaving the neighbors and their dogs to envy her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241164</url></doc>
