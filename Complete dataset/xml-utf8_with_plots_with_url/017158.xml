<plot>At Secure Data Systems, an office in an Ohio suburb, Nancy hesitates as she enters the break room where Ian, a solitary co-worker, sits reading the paper and watching the news on TV. She uses the microwave and sits across from Ian. They talk about Maureen, a recently-murdered co-worker. Ian has a stack of photos on the table that Nancy starts to leaf through - they're of a recent company cook-out. Maureen appears in some of them; Nancy is fascinated and horrified at the same time to see someone recently alive, now bludgeoned to death. There are flashbacks to the party, Ian leaves the room, and Nancy keeps looking through the photos. Are revelations in store?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017158</url></doc>
