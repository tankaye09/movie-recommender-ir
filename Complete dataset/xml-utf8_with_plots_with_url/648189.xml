<plot>Alphonse Allais once said, "We talk about killing time as if it wasn't time who is killing us." Watch tells the story of a man who, like many, is a slave of the watch. The character takes us with him into his daily journey with his perfect timing and synchronized schedule. However, an unexpected event changes his routine and his life as he realizes that time is not always on his side.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648189</url></doc>
