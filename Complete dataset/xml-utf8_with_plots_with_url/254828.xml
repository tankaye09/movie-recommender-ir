<plot>Ethan is a photographer in Los Angeles, still in his 20s, gay, and given to one-night stands that, despite his willingness, don't seem to last past the next morning. His friend Dennis invites him on a getaway to Palm Springs where other friends join them. In the course of the next few days, Dennis and Ethan's relationship goes through several changes as one plays the other, as feelings get hurt, and as Ethan witnesses other men's difficulties with jealousy, commitment, and honesty. To whom can Ethan turn for assurance? To his family, to long-time friends, to his art?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254828</url></doc>
