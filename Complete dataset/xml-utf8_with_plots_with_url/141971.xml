<plot>Sexuality in Germany from 1910 to 1945: beginning with back-to-nature mountain camps and schools that fused athleticism, same-sex intimacy, and nudity; the openly-gay bars during the Weimer Republic; and, Nazi suppression of male and female homosexuality. Historians discuss pedagogical Eros, Hirschfeld's theories and his institute of sexual science, and the Nazi's Paragraph 175, which outlawed homosexual behavior. Survivors describe intimidation and interrogation, the flight of friends, Himmler's edicts, and the confinement and death in concentration camps of gay men and women. The documentary ends at Amsterdam's monument to gay victims of the Holocaust.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?141971</url></doc>
