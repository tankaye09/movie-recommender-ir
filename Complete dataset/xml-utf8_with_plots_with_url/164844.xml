<plot>People around the world have eaten insects since the dawn of time. Some believe that the manna that fell from heaven to feed Moses in the wilderness was actually the sweet excrement of scale insects. The rational Greek philosophers, like Plato and Socrates, chewed locusts between thoughts. It's not that gross, the honey we eat is the secretion of bees and wasps. Apparently, everything goes in cycles. Scientists world-wide seem to be returning tot the rational thought of those ancient Greeks when they recommend insects as a high protein food source for an exploding population.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164844</url></doc>
