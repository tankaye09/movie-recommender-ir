<plot>Monica, a gentle and innocent soul, is worried about her Dad, "Paolo," a tortured artist. After years of seeing his value as an artist decline, Paolo is desperate for his acerbic art dealer, Channing (TERI GARR), to give him one last shot. If he can only keep sweet, albeit slow, Monica, from interrupting their meeting with her abundance of baked goods. However, it's Monica's ability to see beauty in everything, that makes this day unlike any other day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217942</url></doc>
