<plot>Sandhya and Nikhil have been married for 8 years and live a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay, along with a daughter, Rashmi. On their 8th anniversary, they invite several friends, chief amongst them Prabha and her husband, Ramesh; Revati, Gita, and an unexpected guest, a nephew of one their friend's, Rahul. Prabha gets very intoxicated during this get-together, and confides with Sandhya about her rocky marriage. One year later, Nikhil shocks Sandhya when he tells her that he has fallen in love with a much younger woman, Vrunda, and wants to leave her. Sandhya begs and pleads with him to no avail. He does contact Sandhya again after about a year, this time to ask for a divorce. Again, Sandhya pleads with him to return, but he refuses. Then a year later, the estranged couple meet again, and this time it is Nikhil who wants to re-enter Sandhya's life, and this time it is he who is going to be shocked by her candid confessions!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160205</url></doc>
