<plot>Louis Mulkey, the subject of a Sports Center feature and ESPN.com article, was a Captain in the Charleston, SC fire department as well as assistant basketball coach at nearby Summerville High School. Mulkey, along with eight other firefighters perished battling a blaze last June. The team dedicated its upcoming season to Mulkey and ended up winning the state championship in March 2008 in an ending that can only be described as "incredible".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632311</url></doc>
