<plot>After a civil war in Hell, Lucifer has been defeated and the Key to Hell is in Lord Desecrater's grasp. However, the rebellious Dominator has his own thoughts and keeps the Key to Hell away from Lord Desecrater and is forced to fight off his forces including three other demons - Decimator, Extricator and Lady Violator. While on Earth, undertaker and exocrist Dr. Payne is in charge of London's dead. His three daughters who play in their own rockband called Crowcut, accidentally open a gateway to Hell by invoking black magi-ck into their music via the Lost Chord and unleash Dominator. Luckily for humanity, Dominator is willing to defend mankind, even if he is only interested in Dr. Payne's eldest daughter, Tara. When Desecrater learns of what has happened on Earth, he seeks out help using his new human agent - the corrupt politician Bishop, to carry out the rest of his deeds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154920</url></doc>
