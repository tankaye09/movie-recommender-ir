<plot>Backchat was the FX original hosted by Jeff Probst, in which Probst answered questions about the network, the shows that ran on the network, the other original shows on the network, and other hosts on the network. It was a half hour show with viewer mail, via U.S. Mail and e-mail, and there were phone calls where people asked questions. They had the letter of the day segment, and in the later episodes, they had postcards sent in from viewers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055410</url></doc>
