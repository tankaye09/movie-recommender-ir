<plot>Eleven-year-old Eddy experiences the world around him through his writing. Populated by princes, dragons and noble quests his stories help him to cope with his increasingly insecure home life. When the impressive substitute teacher Mr Beech enters Eddy's life like a glowing knight to help him on his quest, Eddy feels safe and sure. When the magic stranger disappears, seemingly without a trace, Eddy abandons his writing. It only takes one final, small gesture from Mr Beech to help Eddy rediscover his creativity and steer a course beyond the debris of his parent's broken marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446257</url></doc>
