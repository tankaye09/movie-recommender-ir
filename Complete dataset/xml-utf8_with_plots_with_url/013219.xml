<plot>"The scene is in front of a tobacco store, with a large bill-board adjoining it. A dude saunters past and gazes admiringly at one of of the poster girls. She comes to life, and steps out of the board. A wooden Indian in front of the tobacco store, becoming jealous, also comes to life. He brains the dudes with his hatchet, scalps him, and presents the scalp to the poster girl as a token of his admiration."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013219</url></doc>
