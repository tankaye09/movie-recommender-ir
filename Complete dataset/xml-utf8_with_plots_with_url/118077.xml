<plot>Gonzaga plays Janice, a day-hire maid and caregiver working in Barcelona to support her family. To escape from hardships even just for a fleeting moment, she and her best friend, Bessie (played by the comedienne Pokwang) would go to parties and identify themselves as rich girls. The charade was going well until Janice meets Wacky (played by Manzano) at a party. The two instantly fall for each other, but Wacky, who was sent in Barcelona by his former OFW father to study, doesn't know Janice's real identity. Worse, the two have no idea they are in an employer-maid relationship. At daytime, Janice fixes Wacky's home as a cleaning woman. Only a note containing their messages to each other facilitates their communication.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118077</url></doc>
