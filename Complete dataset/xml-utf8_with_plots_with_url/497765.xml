<plot>Blockbuster cinema screenwriter Scott Thompson lived to work. In debt after divorce, he wrote hackneyed scripts to pay the bills and quench his workaholic tendencies. With a screenplay due in a week and not a word written, he finds an unlikely muse outside his window - Sophia. Scott's desperate world turns upside down when he becomes obsessed with this free-spirited woman who happens to be homeless. He lived to work, she showed him how to live.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?497765</url></doc>
