<plot>Based on Leslea Newman's story "A Letter to Harvey Milk," this award-winning short examines the sensitive issues that surface when Harry Weinberg, an older Jewish man, enrolls in a creative writing class taught by a lesbian teacher. For one particular assignment, Harry writes a letter to his former customer and friend, the slain political activist, Harvey Milk. The letter unleashes a series of events which impel Marvin, Harry's best friend, to painfully recall and reveal a tragic incident that occurred in a concentration camp forty years earlier.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230925</url></doc>
