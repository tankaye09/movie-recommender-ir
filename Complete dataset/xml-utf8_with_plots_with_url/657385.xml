<plot>This documentary tells the story of a woman who invented herself from scratch. As a child, Willa Cather was taken from her comfortable home in Virginia into the wild Nebraska frontier--a place so vast and empty she felt "erased." Cather survived and even thrived on the plains, eventually pioneering her way east to New York City where she wrote her great novels: O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, My Antonia, Death Comes For the Archbishop and the Pulitzer Prize-winning One of Ours. Willa Cather: The Road Is All is a story of the transforming power of art, illustrating Cather's life through dramatic re-enactments of scenes from her most famous novels.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657385</url></doc>
