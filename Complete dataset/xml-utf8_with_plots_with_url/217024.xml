<plot>Giovanni is a priest who lives a life full of love and certainties. He lives in a modest house with his sister Anna, devoting his life to his fellow man. Then one day a man walks into Giovanni's church and confesses to murdering two women. The priest cannot tell anyone about it, as the secret of the confession forbids him to reveal the atrocity, so he has no other option but to hold the secret inside himself. Meanwhile, the killer keeps returning to the church to talk to Giovanni, as he sees in him his only friend, or at least the only person who cannot refuse to listen. Giovanni tries to understand the reasoning of the killer, but finds it extremely hard, almost impossible and this experience changes his life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217024</url></doc>
