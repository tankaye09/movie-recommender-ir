<plot>Lita is a twenty-something, young woman who is bright, smart, articulate. However the avoidance of the memory of the rape she endured several years earlier has her in the throes of self-abusive behavior. She eats and drinks too much. She has sex indiscriminately. Then she meets Abel, a bookstore clerk with a love of mystical poetry and big women. She wants desperately to love this man but she first must decide to love herself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062442</url></doc>
