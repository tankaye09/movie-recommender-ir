<plot>This was a game based on the ability to predict whether or not your teammate could answer a question correctly. Two teams consisting of a contestant paired up with a celebrity were pitted against one another. The host would ask either team member a question. Before the team member answered, their teammate would predict whether or not they could answer correctly ("Can" or "Can't") and wager a certain amout of money. If the correct answer was given and a "Can" prediction was made, or if a wrong answer was given and a "Can't" prediction made, the team earned the amount of money wagered. If a correct answer was given and a "Can't" prediction was made, or if a wrong answer was given and a "Can" prediction was made, the amount of money wagered was deducted from the team's winnings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254792</url></doc>
