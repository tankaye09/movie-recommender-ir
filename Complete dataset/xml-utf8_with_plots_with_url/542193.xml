<plot>The manager of a new hotel is in trouble--it's opening day and his staff has quit, including the plumbers who have yet to install any bathtubs in the rooms. As angry guests keep demanding rooms with a tub, the manager's janitor tells him of someone he knows who has invented the "automatic bathtub"--just what the manager thinks he needs to keep his guests happy. However, the inventor hasn't quite gotten all the "bugs" out of his invention yet. Complications ensue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542193</url></doc>
