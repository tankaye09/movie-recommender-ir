<plot>Two posters pasted on a wall, one of a dandy dude, the other of a soubrette. The bill poster comes along and pastes a couple of snipes under them and departs. Suddenly the figures on the posters come to life, and stepping down from their respective places, indulge in a fancy dance. Before they step down, however, two tramps stop a man on the street, and strip him of his coat, high hat and cane, leaving their old duds behind. The posters then take life as above described, and then return to their places, becoming inanimate as before. Very good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?571807</url></doc>
