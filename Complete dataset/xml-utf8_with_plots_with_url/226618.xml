When her mom passes away, her dad takes to alcohol in a big way, and also brings home her stepmother, who is also an alcoholic and dislikes Asha. When Asha befriends Guddu, she throws him our of the house. In anger, Asha pushes her down the stairs and kills her. When she grows up, her father sells her to R.K.

When the parrot attempts to fly away, she clips it's wings. When her car breaks down, she has it serviced at Auto Services, and when motor mechanic, Jaikumar Sharma, returns it to her house, she thinks her friend Guddu has returned, seduces and gets intimate with Jai. She frequently breaks her car down, and asks Jai to repair it, but he refuses to be seduced by her nor gets intimate with her.
