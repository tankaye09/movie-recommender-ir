<plot>Passing Through tells the story of Peter Bailey, an ageing projectionist who has witnessed the decline of cinema first hand. On his last day at work, before being forced into early retirement, he locks himself in his beloved projection room and instead of showing Jurassic Park IV, he screens his favourite film, the 40's classic - A Matter of Life and Death. Peter feels he has contributed nothing to this life, left no mark on the world. He's made nothing, destroyed nothing. A temporary image on life's giant screen... He longs for the kind of permanence afforded the movie stars he watches every day. Ultimately, he'll get his wish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425297</url></doc>
