<plot>The eyes with which the film views the megacity of São Paolo is that of a foreigner, the maestro Abbas Kiarostami. The film is a tribute to Kiarostami, who came here as a member of the international jury of the São Paolo International Film Festival, and turned his observations of a street girl into a screen play 'A Good, Good Citizen', never before filmed. It is a tribute to the inhabitants of the city who, despite the poverty, filth and chaos, live and survive with dignity. The architecture of the city centre, both deteriorated and renewed, miserable and opulent, is the setting where these generous people improvise and endure in order to keep their genuine joy of living and face the reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?643305</url></doc>
