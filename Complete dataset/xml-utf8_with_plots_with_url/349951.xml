<plot>Everything is complicated in Yoni's life. He's almost 13, real gifted, but physically undeveloped and struggles daily to grow up before his threatening up-coming Bar Mitzva; He sells homework in order to secretly buy a body building wonder powder, which so far does nothing, he stretches every night with heavy weight tied to his legs and screams with full force in front of the wind to thicken his girlish, unstable voice, that gave him the ridiculous nick name - Helium. His new classmates, a year older and two heads taller, bully him at every chance they get and his parents barely say a word to each other and communicate through him, if at all. As if all this isn't enough - only a week before the ceremony - his autistic brother, Tomer, 17, hidden for years in a hostel that is now shut down - returns home. This shakes not only Yoni's life, but the unstable foundation of the entire family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?349951</url></doc>
