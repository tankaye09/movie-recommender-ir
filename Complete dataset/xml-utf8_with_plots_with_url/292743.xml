<plot>This film is about the lives of three college roommates, Jay, Doug, and Dave. Starting the night off with music and beer, they invite over their friend Claudia. She brings two friends, Caitlin and Mary Beth, with her to the party. After hanging out awhile they decide to spice the night up with a card game called kings round. Doug explains the rules and so it begins. The game brings out emotion, sex, drama, and one wild night. Each character at the table represents a different aspect of the human mind. Caitlin represents the need to belong. Dave represents the jerk in everyone. Doug just wants to be heard. Mary Beth is the player of the group. Jay offers comic relief to the tension caused by the others around the table. Finally Claudia, the lush, who is confused about her current relationship. With all of these people, it turns out to be a wild and crazy night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292743</url></doc>
