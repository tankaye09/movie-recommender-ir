<plot>A look at post-war American railroads during their conversion to peace, operating under the handicap of little to no new equipment. It then looks at the plans for the future designed to provide swifter, safer and more comfortable traveling for the American public. Swifter is about all that is now left of the plans detailed in this 1947 short. The vast majority of the American public has no access to rail travel, all of the depots are gone, along with thousands and thousands of miles of track, and railroading is now a shipping service, mostly of truck trailers and containers. No complaints, other than most wish they could have at least kept the mournful, lonely and lovely sound of the old steam whistle. Diesel horns in the night have inspired very few songs or dreams. The essence of railroading, for older America, is captured in the title of this short.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604669</url></doc>
