<plot>"The real Zingari gypsy is an exceedingly picturesque person, quite different from the wandering nomads we are accustomed to see in America. Our photographer was very fortunate in getting one of these camps by the side of a Hungarian highway, and his work was so successful that one could hardly get a better insight into the life of these strange people if he were to spend months traveling in their own country. The naked children are rolling about on the grass with the dogs, the women are smoking pipes and cooking the evening meal over an out-door fire. The mother is telling fortunes for a stranger, and the whole scene is one of animation. Photographically the view is almost perfect."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008116</url></doc>
