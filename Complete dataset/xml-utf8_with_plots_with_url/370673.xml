<plot>"mindFLUX" explores the legendary, internationally acclaimed American playwright, director and designer Richard Foreman. His story is a remarkable example of how an individual with a unique vision and the courage to bypass rewards of commercial success became one of the preeminent experimental artists of his generation. The film's powerful narrative reveals Mr. Foreman's impact on those who were interviewed for "mindFLUX" including award winning actors, composers, playwrights and cultural icons. They reveal personal and professional challenges faced prior to realizing their own version of success. The film's themes are particularly relevant today as young artists and other professionals will learn how Mr. Foreman and his prominent admirers persevered through adversity and pushed past barriers that seemed insurmountable during their early years. Our inner strength to not give up comes from an unyielding passion for what we do and the unique value it brings to the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370673</url></doc>
