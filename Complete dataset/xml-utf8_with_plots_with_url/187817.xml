<plot>This film captures the band at the Maidstone Fiesta during the summer of 1970 as they run through their set of the time which included various jigs and reels and the songs "Sir Patrick Spens" and "Now Be Thankful". This line up was, and still is, considered one of the key line ups of Fairport Convention: Richard Thompson (Vocals, Guitar), Dave Swarbrick (Vocals,Fiddle, Mandolin), Dave Pegg (Vocals, Bass Guitar, Mandolin), Dave Mattacks (Drums, Percussion), and Simon Nicol (Vocals,Guitar,Electric Dulcimer). Apart from this footage, the Full House line up were never filmed commercially until reunions at the bands regular Cropredy Festival years later. This film also features two songs from Matthews Southern Comfort, the band led by former Fairport Convention member Ian Matthews. Matthews Southern Comfort would also go on to have a massive hit single with a cover of the Joni Mitchell song Woodstock in late 1970. Includes interview with director Tony Palmer thirty five years after the fiesta.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187817</url></doc>
