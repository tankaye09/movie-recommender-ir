<plot>Return home from a trip to Iraq and the questions never stop, "What was it like? Why did you go?" And this film is the answer. Four comedians take you on their journey while traveling and performing through Iraq. From the biggest base in Baghdad to the most remote camp in Ashraf they learn as they film about a different country, about their own military and about the one thing everyone over there misses the most, their family. Four different voices tell a story of sacrifice, hospitality and fear using the only weapon they have, their sense of humor. This is a soldier's story told by comedians, from their faces to ours, from Iraq to home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112064</url></doc>
