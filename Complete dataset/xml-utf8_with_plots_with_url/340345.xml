<plot>Picture secured at Lake Washington, near Seattle, Wash. A favorite sport in this section of the United States. Prizes are offered to those who stay on the logs the longest. Some of the men roll along great distances before falling into the water. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340345</url></doc>
