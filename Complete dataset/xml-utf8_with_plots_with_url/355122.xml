<plot>Prof. La Blanche displays his "couchee abilities" to an advantage in this picture. This dancer is known far and wide as one who can do anything that can be done while dancing, and to see him do the "couchee" is to see it as it was done in the Midway, at Chicago. This film will call for encores when you show it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355122</url></doc>
