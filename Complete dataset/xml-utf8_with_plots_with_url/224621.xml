<plot>Adventure drama based on Persian legend. Mubarak (Kader) kidnaps Sanobar (Mohammed), the son of the king of Yemen (Peerjan) and raises him in the forest. Prompted by Mubarak, Sanobar attacks the king returning from a hunt, but is caught, condemned to be locked up in a box and thrown into the sea. A fakir teaches the king the language of the animals, warning him not to pass on the skill to any other humans. Listening to two birds, the king realizes that Sanobar is his own son. The queen (Jilloo), learning that the king has special linguistic powers, forces him to teach them to her as well. He does so and becomes paralyzed. Only a flower from the mouth of Meherangez, the princess of Sistan (Sulochana) can save him. Umar (Bilimoria), the good prince, attempts the task.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224621</url></doc>
