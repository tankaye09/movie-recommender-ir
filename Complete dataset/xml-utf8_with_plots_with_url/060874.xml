<plot>In a black and white, two-dimensional animated world, it's morning and time for a sleeping man to wake. A cuckoo clock sends a series of birds to fly toward his head to chirp and wake him; he grabs each and tosses them back. They are relentless, and eventually manage to get him into a bathtub with the shower head spraying. Images of mechanical assembly lines appear by the tub while, outside, bobbies keep watch. The metamorphoses continue, heads fly, anarchy takes hold. The entire time, the soundtrack is a fast-paced, repetitive, wordless ditty of vocalese. Suddenly, we realize where we are.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060874</url></doc>
