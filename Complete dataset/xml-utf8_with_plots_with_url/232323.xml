<plot>Hayswood Hospital, in Maysville, Ky, was one of the most unique and historical hospitals in Kentucky. It served as a healing ground for the sick, the dying, and every possible accident or tragedy you could think of. Sadly, it closed its doors in March of 1983. But if it closed in 1983 then why are people still seeing things? Is it over active imaginations or ghosts? Is this hospital still occupied by former staff? Are patients still coming to be treated? Is the hospital still open in a parallel world? This documentary searches for the truth behind the biggest question of them all....Is Hayswood Hospital haunted?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232323</url></doc>
