<plot>"This is a very novel affair, quite different from anything to be seen in America. It takes place annually in one of the public parks of Berlin. All the nurse girls are arrayed in the finest costumes, and stand by the roadside cheering while their little charges ride by in the quaintest vehicles imaginable. Some are drawn by dogs; some by cats; some by diminutive donkeys. All the children are dressed in carnival costume in imitation of those worn by their elders."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008478</url></doc>
