<plot>By 1978 Leonard Cohen had already produced a staggering body of work that had firmly set the standard for the singer-songwriter genre and contained numerous classic songs within its cannon, but the 6 studio albums released between then and 2006 contained some of the finest work of Cohen's entire career. This film examines that period. It mixes rare performance footage, studio recordings, interviews, rarely seen photographs, location shoots and many other features with contributions from some of Cohen's closest colleagues and from experts on his life and music. Featuring his official biographer Ira Nadel; Cohen producers John Lissauer, David Gold and John Simon, journalists Robert Christgau [Village Voice], Anthony De Curtis [Rolling Stone] and Nigel Williamson [Uncut], authors Johnny Rogan and Jim Devlin and many others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329421</url></doc>
