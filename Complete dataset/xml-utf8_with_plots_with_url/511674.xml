<plot>Springed Migration tells an unlikely story about overcoming obstacles...that didn't necessarily need to be overcome. A few months after moving day, two house mates are faced with the question: what do you do with an old rusty trampoline that won't come apart? They gather together friends, neighbors, and complete strangers to help carry the trampoline by hand 6 miles across the city of Austin. They stop along the route to encourage onlookers to take a turn on the trampoline and then join them for a beer, creating a moving block party that brings them all the way to their new home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511674</url></doc>
