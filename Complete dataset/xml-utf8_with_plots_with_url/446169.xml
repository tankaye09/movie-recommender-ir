<plot>Another very remarkable film in which appear almost all the sovereigns of Europe as they are seen in private life, in mufti, and enjoying a family re-union. The picture was made in the garden of the autumn home of the King of Denmark, where the various royal personages walk before the camera chatting gaily, and evidently very much pleased. In the picture appear the King of Greece, the Empress of Russia, the Queen of England, besides various Princes and Princesses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446169</url></doc>
