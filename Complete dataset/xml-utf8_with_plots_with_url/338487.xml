<plot>Frances Collins has been married five years and isn't yet at ease with her married name. She packs a suitcase and heads for work. Rather than return home, at night she changes clothes in the company washroom, and goes to bars looking for a man in whose bed she can spend the night. Sometimes she doesn't find one; drunk, she sleeps wherever she falls. Various folks befriend her: a widow, a musician, a john. A nervous young man offers her a place to rest and clean up. When she leaves his apartment, she forgets her purse; he finds her I. D. , and goes to her place to return the purse. What awaits him isn't pretty. Will Frances eventually return home? How will she handle what she finds?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338487</url></doc>
