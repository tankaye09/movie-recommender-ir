<plot>The innkeeper's daughter is in love, but her mother has already decided that she is going to be married to another man. Raymond, the young woman's fiancé, is devastated. After a few expository scenes, this extremely simple plot becomes fragmented into two mirror-like flashbacks, shown in split-screen: she dreams of her past happiness with her beloved, embracing her during a boat excursion on a pond, he has a nightmare where she is seen embracing the other man. Raymond loses his mind and repudiates the innocent woman, she commits suicide.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?323077</url></doc>
