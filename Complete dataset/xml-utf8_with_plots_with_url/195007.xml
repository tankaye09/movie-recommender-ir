<plot>Finding Angels chronicles the interconnecting journeys of seven individuals, guided by an ancient spirit - Nehkre Sentia. Gabriel, haunted by her presence since early childhood, accepts his destiny and attempts to fulfill it - along with his sister Monica and her friend Regina, he races against time and the unknown, now aware that they are being secretly monitored by elite groups that desire to thwart the spirit's plan. Guided only by visions and dreams, these travelers journey across entire countries only to meet by chance where they join with four more, and together embark on a spellbinding quest resulting in realizations of spectacular lost truths.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195007</url></doc>
