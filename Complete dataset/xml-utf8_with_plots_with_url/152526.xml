<plot>The story of each unique destination is told through interviews with guests, charter operators, dive shop owners, boat captains, dive masters and others. Of primary interest to most divers of course is the underwater footage. Taking advantage of the high resolution of Sony's HDV format, Hi Def Pictures captures the underwater beauty of these locations with breathtaking clarity. The camera is often mounted atop a Diver Propulsion Vehicle, adding to the excitement and range of footage captured. Sites visited in "Diving the Florida Keys" include the Spiegel Grove, USCGC Duane, Molasses Reef, French Reef, Sombrero Reef, the wreck of the Benwood, and the City of Washington. The Florida Keys DVD also includes an introduction to back country fishing in the Everglades National Park, swimming with dolphins at the Dolphin Research Center, and touring Key West - including a visit to the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152526</url></doc>
