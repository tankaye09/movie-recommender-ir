<plot>Jeffrey (Bevan Cullinan) desperately wants to be taken seriously as an actor, but he has resorted to performing at children's parties as Ronnie the clown. The film takes us on a surreal journey as we follow Jeffrey's fragmented life. When he meets Beth (Nicola Jackman), Jeffrey has the chance to turn his life around. His actions could lead to disaster or they could be the key to shedding his life as a clown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109198</url></doc>
