<plot>According to a Gallup poll, ninety six percent of Americans believe in God, while only half of them regularly attend religious institutions. More and more people are finding personal connections to 'the Divine' and seeking out alternative communities to find inner peace and understanding. In a world that promotes consumerism and quick fixes, these alternative places offer a different perspective on life and community. This short documentary film takes us to one of these communities and investigates issues around religion, spirituality, global awareness and meaning. Through meeting the festival participants, we get a feel for the contemporary view of the meaning of life, God and existence told in an entertaining yet educational manner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589102</url></doc>
