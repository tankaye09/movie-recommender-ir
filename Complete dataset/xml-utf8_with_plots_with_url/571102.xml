<plot>If pictures could be taken as fast as the Lightning Artist appears to work, and if he could create his wearing apparel, wine and cigars, and use them as he does in this picture, the merchant would soon be an unknown quantity. Our artist friend draws a picture of a boy on the canvas, places a pipe in his mouth with his chalk and then takes the pipe out of the picture and proceeds to smoke it. He does the same with a glass of wine. He then draws a high hat on the figure, lifts it out of the picture and places it on his own head. He continues to perform other tricks of like character until you are dumbfounded. Full of mystery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?571102</url></doc>
