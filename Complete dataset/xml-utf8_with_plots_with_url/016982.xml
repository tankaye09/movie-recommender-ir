<plot>A look at Nate Wiley and his trio, the Crowd Pleasers, performing at Bob and Barbara's Lounge in Philadelphia: Nate on tenor, Cliff Lamar on drums, and Howard Candie on the Hammond B3. Each of the men talks a bit as the soundtrack plays their jazz. We see the club, a bar really, informal, except for these three elegantly dressed older musicians. Pabst Blue Ribbon is the beer, swing is the rhythm; the colors of the lounge are bright.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016982</url></doc>
