<plot>Jack and Jill, a recently divorced suburban couple, at one time seemed to have it all. Now, wounded and vengeful, they find ways to blame the other for the loss of their cookie cutter lives. Despite their resentment, they love their daughter Brady and make feeble attempts to keep her shielded from their game. This short story opens with Jack sitting in front of his former home holding a restraining order and a gun. Intensity turns to absurdity in a world where adults act like children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271829</url></doc>
