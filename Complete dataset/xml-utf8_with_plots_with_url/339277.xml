<plot>Living In Missouri is a comedy of manners which tells the story of RYAN, AMY, and TODD, whose humdrum Midwestern lives are starting to come apart at the seams. Personal betrayals abound when childhood friendships, broken-down marriages, and long-repressed desires come into conflict over the course of one tumultuous Missouri autumn. Ryan and Todd have been best friends since the 7th grade, and time has not been kind to either of them. Ryan is now married to Amy, with two young children and a 9-to-5 job he hates. The sexually frustrated Todd still lives in the basement of his parents' house, works in a video store, and secretly envies Ryan's married life. Meanwhile, Amy is stuck in the middle, balancing career and family with almost no help from Ryan, whose selfish behavior is quickly destroying what's left of their marriage. When Amy secretly turns to Todd for a shoulder to cry on, the two of them begin meeting regularly to discuss her marital woes. Todd misinterprets Amy's attention for love, and believes that they are actually "having an affair," which leads to a series of painful misunderstandings, ending in disaster. Living In Missouri is a challenging, darkly comic film, shot on location in Missouri and Kansas. Boasting a colorful cast of supporting characters, the film veers from dark humor to intense drama, at each turn authentically capturing the bizarre spirit of the Suburban Midwest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339277</url></doc>
