<plot>Eve, a young college student, is caught between two men she loves, the only problem is, they're the same man. When her boyfriend, Max, inadvertently discovers time travel, sending himself backwards in time, he must convince Eve in the past to help him sabotage his own machine. As she starts to help the future version of Max, she starts to notice a rift forming between her and the present Max, and realizes the thing she's sabotaging may in fact be the relationship itself. As her relationship falls apart and the machine gets built in spite of her best efforts, she realizes that Max's intentions were not to save himself or stop the work he was doing, but rather to save her, and to keep her from dying in the same explosion that sends him back along the time line.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362022</url></doc>
