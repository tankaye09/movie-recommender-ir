<plot>The magician enters upon a stage, and removing a covering from a small table, shakes it before the audience to show that there is nothing whatever concealed inside, places the cloth upon the floor, and when he removes it five large geese are found to be swimming in the water. The magician takes the geese out of the tub, and places them on the stage, and they walk away. He again places the cloth over the tub, and when he removes it the tub disappears and a small boy stands in its place. The boy walks off the stage to the astonishment and amazement of the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103740</url></doc>
