<plot>In this picture we show the ending of this ca√±on, taken from the front of a locomotive on the Canadian Pacific R.R., running through this marvelous piece of scenery at a high rate of speed. The train seems to be running into the mountains of rock as each curve is reached and rounded, making the scene exciting from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422079</url></doc>
