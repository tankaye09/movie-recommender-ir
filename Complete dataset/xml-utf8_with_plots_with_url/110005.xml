<plot>Question and answer program that gives "tweens" the opportunity to choose a bizarre avatar to represent themselves and play against others online, against a friend on the PC, or against the computer. Educational questions are presented in casual and humorous manner by "snarky" host, who is likely to tease you if you get the answer wrong. Game is broken up into two separate titles: X-Treme Culture and Calculated Risk, with the first focusing more on history, grammar, and the like; the other focuses on science, nature, math and similar subjects. There is some overlap in gameplay between the two. Game reviewed very well by most who published reviews, but public never really knew game existed due to market conditions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110005</url></doc>
