<plot>Don Segundo concedes he's been a scoundrel all his life that he is expecting no one to attend his wake. His last will and testament therefore states that he will give P100 million pesos each to the first two people who will sign the official guest book in his wake. A scheme goes wrong and Don Segundo's legitimate heirs Bogart, Julius and Menchie end up signing in at numbers 3 and 4. Two strangers Wilson and Uging end up signing the official guest book first. Wilson is an industrious fellow who does different odd jobs for a living. Uging is the son of a native chieftain who needs money to pay off a land grabber for their ancestral lands. But the P100 million inheritance is subject to the completion of three conditions: (1). That the heirs find Don Segundo's ex-lover Marita whom he left pregnant. (2) That the heirs reopen a club the Don used to run and get its former employees. (3) The third is to restore the Don's ancestral home in Batangas for his child with Marita. In the event that the original heirs cannot fulfill the above conditions, the third and fourth people who signed in the guest book will have the opportunity and the inheritance. The work is cut out not only for Wilson and Uging but for Bogart, Julius and Menchie as well. The heroes will try their best to fulfill the Don's wishes while the villains will try their best to prevent it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355670</url></doc>
