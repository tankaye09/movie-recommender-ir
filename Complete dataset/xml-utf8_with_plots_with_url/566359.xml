<plot>This is a side splitter. A young man returns to his bachelor quarters after a night at the club clad in his dress suit, and immediately begins to disrobe. He throws off his coat and vest and is just proceeding to pull his shirt over his head when he finds the coat back on his body. They are again thrown off in great rage, when he instantly appears dressed in the uniform of a policeman. This is removed, when as quick as lightning, he is rigged out as a sailor. As fast as his clothes are removed and thrown upon the floor different costumes instantly appear in their places. At last one of the uniforms is suddenly mysteriously changed into a night robe, and the young man in evident satisfaction makes for his bed, but he finds a skeleton perched upon the pillow. He reaches for the uncanny object and after clasping it in his arms, it suddenly turns into a chair, which he throws angrily to the floor and retires. After getting into bed, his nightshirt is suddenly changed into a full dress suit and he finds himself sitting up fully dressed as when he first appeared. Then the bed suddenly flies out from under him and great showers of feathers and bedclothes, small pieces of furniture, and other contributions are dropped from the ceiling upon the happy victim, who vows that he will never drink again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566359</url></doc>
