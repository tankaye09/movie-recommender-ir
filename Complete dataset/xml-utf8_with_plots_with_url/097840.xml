<plot>"Celeste, siempre Celeste" is the sequel of "Celeste". It begins with Franco, Celeste and their baby son Lucas finally together and happily preparing their wedding. They marry and leave for a honeymoon. Meanwhile, Franco's mother, Teresa, who hates everyone, especially Celeste (who Teresa still thinks of as a servant although Celeste inherited half of what Teresa considers her fortune), plans Celeste's kidnapping and murder. Celeste is kidnapped but escapes. During the escape she falls and loses her memory and is hospitalized. Meanwhile, the kidnapper makes it look as though Celeste is dead. Franco can't find comfort. He sends Lucas to Italy in the care of a Silvana while he enters a Seminary. Dr. Amadeo Pizzamilio is married to a much younger woman who looks exactly like Celeste except with black hair. In fact, she is the twin sister of Celeste, who was sold by Amadeo (Celeste's mother's doctor) to Margarita, a prostitute. Years later, when she turned 16, he buys her back and marries her. Clara sleeps with anyone and everyone but loves no one. She leaves Amadeo and moves in with her aunt Benita, who works as the cook in the seminary. This happens at the same time that Celeste is in the hospital with no memory. A friend of Amadeo, Dr. Marcelo Marcelino, sees Celeste, thinks she's Clara and tells Amadeo. Although Amadeo knows that she is Celeste, he takes her home and tells everyone including her that she is his wife Clara. Celeste, of course, will have great difficulty in remembering any of this past. Meanwhile in the seminary Franco meets Clara and is immediately taken by her resemblance to Celeste. She pretends to be a sweet innocent in the hopes of taking her sister's place as the wealthy wife of the handsome and powerful Franco Ferrero. Eventually, Franco asks her to change her hair to blonde to match Celeste's hair and brings Clara home telling everyone that Celeste is alive but lost her memory. Once she is in the mansion, Franco begins to realize that Clara may look like Celeste on the outside but she is nothing like her on the inside. So he continues to long for Celeste. At this point he finds the real Celeste who still has amnesia and thinks that she is Clara. He begins to court her all over again. Clara will do everything she can in order to keep Celeste and Franco apart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097840</url></doc>
