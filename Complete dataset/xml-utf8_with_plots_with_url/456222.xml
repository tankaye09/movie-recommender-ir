When he shows up to sign the papers and take ownership he learns from the caretaker that the castle has quite an interesting and famous history; a history that includes supernatural and sometimes horrific events. Although he doesn't believe the stories, he soon finds out that there is more going on than meets the eye. During the signing of the papers he is transported to the past where he must live through the events described by the caretaker and somehow find his way back home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?456222</url></doc>
