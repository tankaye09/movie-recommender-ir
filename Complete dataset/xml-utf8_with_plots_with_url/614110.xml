<plot>Based on the children's novel of the same name by Rumer Godden, this 10-part stop-motion animated mini-series tells the story of Tottie, a small wooden Dutch doll, and her "family of dolls", which were made up of Mr Plantaganet ("father"), Mrs Plantaganet aka Birdie ("mother"), Apple ("little brother") and Darner (pet dog). Their wish for a proper home was finally fulfilled, when their owners' relatives gave them an old dolls' house which they found in the attic of a deceased Great Aunt's house. Happiness, however, was short-lived. One day, Tottie's owners were given a beautiful doll which used to live in the dolls' house. Her name was Marchpane, and as the saying goes, "Do not judge a book by its cover", Marchpane's beauty was just superficial. She was mean and heartless, and over time, she took control of the dolls' house and ultimately caused the death of Birdie. With this being a children's program, it created quite a controversy when this show was first aired on TV.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?614110</url></doc>
