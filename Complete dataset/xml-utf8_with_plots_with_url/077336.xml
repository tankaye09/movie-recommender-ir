<plot>Bobby Darin is one of the great voices of American popular music. He was also one of the great performers of his time, appearing in films, playing his drums, his guitar, or just using his voice to make audiences swoon to his crooning, or laugh to his numerous impressions. This fabulous collection of rare performances presents Bobby as he would have wanted to have been remembered, as the consummate performer giving his all to his audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077336</url></doc>
