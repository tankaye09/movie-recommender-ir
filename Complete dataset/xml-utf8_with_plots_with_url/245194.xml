<plot>One of the funniest yet of the Hooligan series. Happy Hooligan and his friend, "Dusty" Rhodes, come along just as some boys place a large firecracker under a fruit peddler's cart. The peddler is asleep. Hooligan, always ready to render service, endeavors to extinguish the fireworks before the explosion occurs, but he is blown up with the peddler, and his lucky friend "Dusty" gets the spoils. Hooligan and the peddler come down to earth together in several pieces, but the magic of "Dusty" Rhodes succeeds in patching them up. A very funny finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245194</url></doc>
