<plot>Set in Oklahoma where more women are incarcerated per capita than anywhere else in the country, EMPOWERING THE YARD looks at HIV prevention from the perspective of incarcerated women who are using peer education to empower themselves, their families, and their communities. The HIV Peer Education Program provides an opportunity for incarcerated women to teach each other about the issues they face including safe sex, sexually transmitted infections, drugs, and violence. Five HIV Peer Educators explain why incarceration rates for women are so high and they speak about the self-esteem and empowerment they have gained through the HIV Peer Education Program.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176892</url></doc>
