<plot>Jobless Dennis, to his wife's dismay, wants to be a speech writer for professional wrestlers. She, the overbearing, bingo playing gossip, wears the pants in the family and makes it painfully clear that she doesn't believe in him. While assisting her at the grocery store a conflict arises with a shopper enabling Dennis to try out his newest tough guy speech. He sure gets a beat down, but ironically gains respect of his wife and some enthusiastic shoppers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?142521</url></doc>
