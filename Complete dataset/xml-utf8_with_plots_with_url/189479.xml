<plot>The world is thrown into commotion since the invention of the Portal. The discovery of a new dimension, Emoworld, makes clear that not only in our sleep and in our own heads a dreamworld exists. It's a real world with real people. And not just people, but also different lifeforms we previously only knew as mythical, folklorist and not really existing, are populating the newly discovered dimension. When these beings escape, although they are strictly forbidden to enter our world, measures are taken. An entirely new kind of security force is called into existence: the Fantasy Hunters. The co-existence of the worlds does not run smoothly. A terrible secret has irreversible and disastrous consequences. It seems that even the fantasy hunters can't prevent a catastrophe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?189479</url></doc>
