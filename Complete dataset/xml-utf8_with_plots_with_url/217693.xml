<plot>Ron Barnes, a white educator in 1964, now retired, took his family to Tuskegee Institute, a black university, to teach for the summer. The stories he has to tell and those from his wife and daughter are the anecdotes from which this documentary are built. The experiences of two black participants, one a political activist who grew up in the south and the other, black former Catholic priest offer additional insight of what it was like during that era. Their personal first hand experiences provide original insights into that period.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217693</url></doc>
