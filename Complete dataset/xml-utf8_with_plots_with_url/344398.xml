<plot>Over a lunch of crab in the shell, Ian listens to Barrett complain that Kaylie, Barrett's girlfriend, is being unfaithful. The proof: a partially-eaten hamburger (she's a vegetarian) and a want ad she's running for a male roommate. Ian defends her. Cut to Kaylie in her apartment, interviewing Derek, a ringer Barrett has sent to answer the ad, try to seduce Kaylie, and see if she's cheating on him. It's not sex, however, that Kaylie has in mind. A few minutes later, Barrett barges in hoping to catch her red handed. Will Barrett figure out what's really going on? When Ian arrives moments later, do Barrett's chances look better or worse? And what's in that stroganoff?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344398</url></doc>
