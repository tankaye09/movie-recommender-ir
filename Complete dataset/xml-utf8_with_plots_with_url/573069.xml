<plot>In a cafe, a white woman walks away from her table to get silverware. When she returns, she sees a black man eating her lunch. She shares her dinner with the stranger, and he gets coffee for the two of them. Not until he leaves does she look across the room and see that her own meal was on another table. The story derives from a classic urban legend, usually referred to as "A Packet of Biscuits" and circulating since 1972. The same plot was used in the Dutch film "Boeuf Bourgignon" (1988), although neither filmmaker was aware of the other film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573069</url></doc>
