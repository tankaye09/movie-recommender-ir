<plot>CASTING is a short documentary about the person behind the personality. For the first time, through a regular casting session, we witness the daily reality of actors, full of hope, dreams, humor, drama and tears. As if in a psychiatrist's practice, we become part of the daily struggle required to get a role. In less than 15 minutes, 35 actors are capable of impressing us with stories about their lives in theater, film, and including their lives as a waiters and waitresses.... CASTING is an homage to the actor, with a special nod to those who always stand in the background.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096248</url></doc>
