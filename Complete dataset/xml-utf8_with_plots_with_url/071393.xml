<plot>An interesting series of pictures taken of President Roosevelt during his summer trip through New England. The President is shown meeting the distinguished committeemen on the platform, being introduced to the audience, making his speech, leaving with escort, and finally the audience scrambling for the roses which decorated the speaker's stand. All very clear photographically.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071393</url></doc>
