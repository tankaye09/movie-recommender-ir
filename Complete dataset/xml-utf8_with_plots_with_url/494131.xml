<plot>Bunch of colored gentlemen (?) engaged in an interesting and exciting dice game popularly known as "craps." These black-skinned gamblers feel quite secure within a city alley, and are so much absorbed in "rolling the bones" that they do not see the blue-coated officer of the law, who suddenly breaks in upon their speculative operations; creating a panic "on change." A most laughable scrimmage and tussle occurs about this time, resulting in a general rout of the "Monte Carlo" element.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494131</url></doc>
