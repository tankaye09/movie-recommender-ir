<plot>Andreas Deja, the animator of many of Disney's villains from the 1990s, speaks about the value of studying classic cartoon shorts to aid in his ability to animate. He then goes to the drawing board, where he shows how to bring the Disney character Pluto to life from just one circle, like how he did it for his work in the 1990 short, "The Prince and the Pauper".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436397</url></doc>
