<plot>Rosy lives a wealthy lifestyle in India along with her dad, and a step-mother. She studies and lives in a hostel and shares a room with Chitra, who is in love with Raja. Rosy has fallen into bad company and starts taking drugs so much so that she becomes ill and is hospitalized. After she is discharged she returns to the hostel. Shortly thereafter some hoodlums attempt to sexually molest her and Chitra but both manage to escape with Raja's help, but Chitra ends up in hospital. While Chitra is being looked after, Rosy passes out, a doctor examines her and informs Raja that she is pregnant. After recuperating, Chitra questions Rosy as to the identity of the father, but Rosy denies having any sexual relationship with any male. The question does remain: how did Rosy get pregnant?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391587</url></doc>
