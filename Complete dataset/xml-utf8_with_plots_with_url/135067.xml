<plot>Here we present a most remarkable picture, representing a great scientific achievement. Two naval divers are seen going down from a boat, on the deck of which their comrades are seen pumping air to them through pipes and feeding out their life lines. After the divers go well below the surface of the rolling waves the scene changes to the bottom of the ocean, and various shapes and species of fish are seen to be swimming about. As hundreds of thousands of people have no conception of how divers accomplish their work, this will be a most amusing and interesting scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135067</url></doc>
