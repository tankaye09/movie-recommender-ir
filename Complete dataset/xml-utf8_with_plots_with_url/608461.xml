<plot>TRUE STORIES OF THE NYPD is a fascinating journey through a century and a half of law enforcement in the Big Apple, reliving historic cases and exposing little-known stories of danger and courage. From Teddy Roosevelt to Serpico, we'll examine the personalities that left their mark on the force, along with landmark cases such as the Son of Sam, the Zodiac Killer and the French Connection. And we'll hear from insiders like Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Ed Koch, former commissioners William Bratton, Robert Maguire and Patrick Murphy, and Pulitzer PrizeÂ® winning historians Edmund Morris and Edwin Burrows. This is an extraordinary, behind-the-scenes chronicle of the history of the NYPD.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608461</url></doc>
