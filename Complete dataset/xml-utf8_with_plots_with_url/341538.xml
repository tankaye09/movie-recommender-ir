<plot>A new view of this exciting and hair-raising sport. Two views are shown. In the first part the entire loop is shown at close range and many cars are seen following each other in quick succession down the steep slope and whirling with wonderful rapidity around the circle. The second view gives a still closer view of the cars as they leave the circle and go shooting out towards the camera, the different expressions of fear, pleasure and excitement on the passengers' faces being plainly discernible.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341538</url></doc>
