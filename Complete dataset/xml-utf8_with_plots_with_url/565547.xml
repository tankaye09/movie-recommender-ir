<plot>The Huichols, who live in the western Sierra Madre mountains of central Mexico, are best known for their peyote rituals, their shamanistic practices, and their colorful, intricate textiles. However, like many indigenous peoples the Huichols have no written history; the continuation of their culture depends on the vitality of their oral traditions. Chilio Sanchez and Luis Gonzalez, from Las Guayabas, a small Huichol village, are working to preserve the oral traditions and histories of their people. In this unusual documentary they share some of the history, culture, traditional tales, and art of the Huichol.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?565547</url></doc>
