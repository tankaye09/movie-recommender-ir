<plot>Anna, a struggling actress looking for a break into the business, gets the chance she's been waiting for when she lands the lead in an independent film. When her role begins to mirror her own life, she finds that only by reliving painful memories she can succeed as an actress. The line between appearance and reality gets blurred as we follow Anna's efforts to complete the film without losing herself in the character she's playing, with potentially disastrous consequences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485542</url></doc>
