<plot>Life isn't easy for a young man like David. Convinced that his life has been tarnished by his past mistakes, he is resigned to hole himself up in his shanty apartment, until his probation officer starts hassling him to complete his remaining hours of community service. When David arrives at a Halloween party for underprivileged children, he is berated by the schoolteacher who organized the event, mainly because he forgot to come in costume. Banished to a table far in the corner of the auditorium, he ends up befriending a young boy dressed as Darth Vader, who offers to give him part of his costume. What follows is a heartfelt testament to the innocent acceptance of children and one man's shot at redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130221</url></doc>
