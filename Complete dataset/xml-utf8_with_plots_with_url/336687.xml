<plot>In this apparently lost film an inventor uses a strange jewel to bring to life a statue of Lilith, and falls in love with her. Soon, however, she begins to appear on a screen, also developed by the inventor, which reveals her to be a vampire who is slowly sucking his life essence from him, causing him to gradually fade away. He realizes the situation has become even more drastic when he notices his new love, Ly, is being possessed by Lilith and has also begun fading away.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336687</url></doc>
