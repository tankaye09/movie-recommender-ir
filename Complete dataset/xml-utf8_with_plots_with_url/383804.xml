<plot>After an 11-year long and 7,000-mile separation, the writer &amp; director comes back from Europe to California, hoping to find the heroic image of his singer-guitarist father that he had taken with him years ago. In the meantime and at the age of over 60, his father had become a flamenco dancer! In order to face and learn to accept this new father image, he takes us on a cultural round-trip from Sonoma County, California to Seville, Spain which explores the creative complicity that nurtures the flamenco "art de vivre" that his father, Robin and his companion, Elaine share with their Andalusian friend and maestro José Galván and his peers. His personal challenge to present this « new family » of American and Spanish artists to the Parisian audience at the Planète Andalucia Theater is a success. The intimate, yet explosive live finale performance sums up in music and dance a lesson in unconditional love and understanding</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383804</url></doc>
