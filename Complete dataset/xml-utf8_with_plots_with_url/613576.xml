<plot>This is doubtless the most exciting and thrilling picture ever secured. Three torpedo boats are seen racing at full speed. They come straight toward the camera, one of them about two hundred feet in advance of the other two. Running at enormous speed, they throw huge volumes of water and spray over their bows. When within about two hundred feet of the camera, they change their course slightly and pass very close to the lens, giving a full life-size view. This is sure to excite, thrill and interest any audience, as it doubtless shows three of the fastest running boats in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?613576</url></doc>
