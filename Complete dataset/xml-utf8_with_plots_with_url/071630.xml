<plot>Bird Feeder is a film about hope. It is set in a possible future in Southampton where Seagulls have risen to the top of the food chain and we have taken a fall down the pecking order. Screen South as part of the Film Council's regional Digital Shorts scheme commissioned 'Bird Feeder', where a budget of up to 10k is given annually to director/writer teams across the UK. The city is in its death throws. Suicide is the norm. Nobody is happy and everyone is turning into fish. They are food to the monstrous seagulls that dominate everything, from the festering garbage hulks on the river to the buildings of the once proud city. Witness to a beautiful act of rebellion, an ordinary man realizes he must take action - he's fallen in love and there are NOT plenty more fish in the sea.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071630</url></doc>
