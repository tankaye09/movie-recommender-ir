Their research was thorough enough to convince Charles and Ellen Drakes, but since there's a far richer trust-fund Roger no longer wants to walk away with just the reward. Julia, a real orphan who never knew her parents, wants to call it all off because of Ellens maternal warmth, but Roger convinces her that's just as cruel on 'mother'. Police Lt.
