<plot>Insect is an experimental animation. A journey of erotic imagination with out the intervention of words creating a space between dream and reality. This is a world where all things become possible. Here a beautiful woman grows wings and slowly turns into an insect, but not before having sexual encounters with plants and a very amorous dragon fly. This metamorphosis is a devise in dealing with the images of desire unbounded by conventional form and stories and reminds us of how the concept of the erotic is often bounded by practical, social regulation, taboos etc. Metamorphosis is age old, it appears in the mythology of all cultures for eg. the Aboriginal Dream Time Stories, where traditionally there is no gap between the real and the fantastic. In mythology there is no clear separation between the vegetative, the animal (insect)or the human. We are dealing with something which is fundamental to the nature of everything. A deep sense we are all related to the boundlessness of nature.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265739</url></doc>
