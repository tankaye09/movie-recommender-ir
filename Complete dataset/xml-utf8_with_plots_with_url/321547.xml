<plot>Upon coming home for his father's funeral, Lavender Green can't hold it together. He can't keep from sulking, can't keep from drinking, can't keep from smoking. In fact, the only thing he can keep himself from doing is attending the funeral. As Lavender drowns his sorrows in a downward spiral of isolated binging, his brother Grant grows anxious and frustrated at Lavender's apparent lack of consideration for the family, and comes to see him in his hotel room. The resulting clash of words and memories makes a subtle but solid impression on Lavender that changes his outlook on truth, family, and life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321547</url></doc>
