<plot>In summer 2005 Israel withdraws from the Gaza-strip. While the world has its eyes fixed on the small area on the Mediterranean, life goes on in its own absurd way in the Westbank. The focus is on a 35 year old Palestinian named Ramadan, who is living in Qalandia refugee-camp, even though he has a good job: He is camera-operator for Al-Jazeera at the Ramallah office of the well-known Arabian network. The camera gives him the feeling of producing something meaningful while his homeland is caught in daily absurdities. "Daily life has a completely different meaning in Palestine. Commented by Ramadan the film delivers insight into a life under occupation.
