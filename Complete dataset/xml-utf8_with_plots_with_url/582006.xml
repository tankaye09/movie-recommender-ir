<plot>Lyari Expressway is the largest urban demolition project for the purpose of road-making in the world. If built, over 250,000 persons will be displaced and many thousand businesses destroyed.

City experts say that not only is the expressway unnecessary, the consequences of building it would be disastrous for the city.
