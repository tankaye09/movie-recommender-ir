<plot>Utterly devastated by causing his bride's drowning death while drunk-driving, Harry leaps off a railroad trestle into dark waters below. He is fished out and sent to a private sanitarium run by Dr. Brewer and Dr. Fargo. The two have a nefarious operation inside: selling beautiful young girls to Middle-Eastern sheikhs for their harems. Under mind control and hypnotic drugs, Harry is routinely sent out as a handsome bait to lure more captives. In his lucid moments, Harry explores upstairs after filching keys from sadistic orderly Otto. Admitting himself into off-limit quarters, he surprises a beautiful woman who claims she's movie star Marilyn Monroe, that another body was substituted for hers and that somebody rich and powerful had her sent here. She pleads for Harry's help in escaping. They eventually fall in love and, after harrowing and horrible ordeals below, including a fight to the death with the enraged Otto, flee the place, but not before Brewer and Fargo meet their ironic fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?358282</url></doc>
