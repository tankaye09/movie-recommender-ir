<plot>"Chicl√©" addresses the innocence and incorruptibility of a young boy trying to survive and remain on the path to morality in an impoverished third-world community, despite the depraved actions of those around him. Pablo, a Peruvian street kid, discovers a lost American girl and sacrifices his means of survival---selling gum--- to help her find her mother. Meanwhile, his older brother robs an American tourist who happens to be lost girl's mother and gives the stolen money to his own mother. Pablo has to return to his family heartbroken and empty-handed. But his spirits are raised when his brother presents him with a stolen photo of the girl, and his mother gives him two American dollars to buy gum for the next day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102729</url></doc>
