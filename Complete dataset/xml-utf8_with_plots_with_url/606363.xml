<plot>The White Horse Rapids are just below Miles Canyon. This is the swiftest stretch of waters in the Yukon River, and probably the roughest piece of inland waters navigated by man. The constant rocking of the scow shown by the heaving of the picture on the screen is so realistic as to cause many spectators to feel a genuine touch of sea-sickness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606363</url></doc>
