<plot>Kailash Nath is the Manager of a Bank and lives a comfortable lifestyle with his wife, Savitri, and son, Kishan. He is friendly with the Bank Watchman, Shankar Dayal Khurana, so much so that he arranges the marriage of Kishan with Shankar's daughter, Sanam. Shortly after the marriage of the two children, the bank is robbed, Kailash becomes a suspect, is arrested, charged, and sentenced to 12 years in prison. After he completes his sentence he returns home to find out that Savitri and Kishan are not traceable. He also finds out that he was framed for the bank robbery by none other than Shankar, who is now the Mayor of this town. In the meantime, Kishan, now grown up, goes to take Sanam home with him as his bride. She refuses to do so, but he forcibly takes her, so Sanam decides to go along too. What Kishan does know is that Sanam to get married to Pradeep, the only son of millionaire Lalla, but before doing that she wants to publicly humiliate Kishan and Savitri.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476611</url></doc>
