<plot>A man enters a barber shop and after the tonsorial artist lathers him, he lifts off the customer's head, carries it to the washstand, shaves him and after washing off the suds, places the head on his shoulders again, whereupon the customer pays the barber and withdraws. This is one of the funniest pictures ever seen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059200</url></doc>
