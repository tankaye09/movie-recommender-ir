<plot>Tokiko "Key" Mima's is a completely human looking robot that lives in a farming valley in present day Japan. Her grandfather has just died in an "accident". He makes a tape recording telling her his final wishes and how to become human. Key needs to make 30,000 friends to make the transformation. Helping Key are her mysterious powers and her friends who believe that she is just a delusional girl who thinks she is a robot because she grew up in a house full of robots. They believe that the 30,000 friends will snap her out of it. Their only obstacle is the mysterious corporation that killed her grandfather and their robots that are fueled by the same power as Key's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290095</url></doc>
