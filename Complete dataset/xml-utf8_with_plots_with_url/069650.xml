<plot>Big Sal is looking forward to a life of retirement and quiet comfort and his new partner Pauley wants for a more stable position with the Santiago crime family. The head of the family, Lil' Ed, is continuing his father's success when he learns that his accountant, Roger, has stolen seven and a half million dollars from him. Sal has one more day of work, cleaning up the messes created by other people. Before the day is through two brothers and a case of mistaken identity set off a frustrating, chaotic chain of events that bring Big Sal to the brink of failure and the tarnishing of his perfect record. Everybody has one regret, one big mistake that has changed life, as they know it. Seven million dollars one mistake brings eight people together who can't walk away. Greed, vengeance and pride are where uncommon people find common ground. Good people can perpetuate misdeeds and even killers can have the best intentions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069650</url></doc>
