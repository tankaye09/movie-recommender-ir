<plot>Cheung Chun Fai (Eason Chan) is a successful interior designer, whose only priority in life is earning money. Friends and family are of little importance. When he was a child, Fai dreamed of being a firefighter, and even prayed to God that his dream would come true. This earnest wish so touched his friend Kiu (Gil) that it inspired her to become a firefighter. She still has not gotten over her childhood love for Fai. During a car accident, Fai and Kiu meet again. After the accident, Fai ends up getting fired from his company, and also discovers that the accident has left him with a strange supernatural power- whenever he touches someone, he is able to feel what they are feeling....happiness, despair, pain, etc. Fron now on, every time Fai intends to hurt someone, he can feel the pain and sadness of his victims at the same time. Because of these experiences, Fai starts to change back into a kind man, and Fai and Gil fell in love at last. They disagree on one thing however, which is Fai's plans to take revenge on the company that disgraced him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103509</url></doc>
