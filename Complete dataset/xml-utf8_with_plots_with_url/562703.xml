<plot>The Green House Girls follows filmmaker Andrea Ajemian and her closest college girlfriends from Los Angeles to New York on a one-week road trip during the summer of 2001, when they were twenty-five years old. As they discuss various topics affecting young women today including career and education, religion and spirituality, sex and relationships, body image and eating disorders, and marriage and children, the women gain insight into each other's hopes, dreams, and fears. By interviewing women along their journey, they gain a new perspective on life. This film is about the bonds of friendship and the beauty of being a woman in America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562703</url></doc>
