<plot>A beautiful young woman is driving through the English countryside during a terrible snowstorm. She wrecks her car, and is found by a bitter, reclusive former American racecar driver, who was crippled in an accident. He has some secrets of his own that are hidden. The two fall in love with each other, and he almost blows things with her. He had to learn that sometimes love doesn't come easily, and when it does after a struggle, it is even more precious.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329489</url></doc>
