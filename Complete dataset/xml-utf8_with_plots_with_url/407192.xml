<plot>Sean, a young American, is swept into the foreign world of a Ukrainian hospital as he battles painful poisoning. He is confused and feverish, unsure of what the doctors are saying. He is accompanied by a young American-Ukrainian girl who is helping him translate, but soon she leaves him isolated and unable to properly communicate with the native Ukrainians around him. He soon finds out that the hospital staff will not let him leave and will not even let him venture outside of the confining walls. They are suspicious he is not taking his medicine. Sean ponders escape in his restless state. But once he escapes the sterile imprisonment, how is this American to venture through the vast sea of Odesa?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407192</url></doc>
