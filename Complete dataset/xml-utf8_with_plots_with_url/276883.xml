<plot>What makes someone so desperate to go on a suicide mission? How do Muslims look at the people of other faiths? What is Jihad? These are the questions that all of us have been asking since 9/11/2001. "JIHAD: Searching For Answers" is a documentary on Muslim-Americans and how they feel about today's Islamic society, terrorism and its affects. This documentary interviews various groups of people (mainly youths and community leaders) in the Middle Eastern and South Asian communities to find out what they think about the current affairs, the post 9/11 world, and their place in the American society. "JIHAD: Searching For Answers" searches for the core of the Islamic community in the United States and interviews Muslim community leaders, scholars, and authors to find out their thoughts on issues such as 9/11 terrorist attacks, sectarian violence in the holy land, and the conflict in the Middle East.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276883</url></doc>
