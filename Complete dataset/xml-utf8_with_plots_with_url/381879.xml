<plot>Nobody plays 'Him/Herself" in this fictional murder mystery, even if the two leads, Skitch' Henderson and Frances Lane do play characters named Skitch Henderson and Frances Lane. In this "Fictional-plot" film, band-leader Skitch Henderson plays a fictional newspaper gossip columnist named Skitch Henderson, which isn't Himself, and when a caf√©-society playboy is murdered, the fictional Skitch Henderson joins in while the police investigate. While the police are taking fingerprints at the playboy's apartment, gossip-columnist Henderson sits down at the piano and starts playing, which is no big surprise since the fictional Skitch Henderson is played by the real Skitch Henderson who made a living playing the piano. The police bring in a fictional character named Frances Lane---oddly enough played by a real singer named Frances Lane--- as a prime suspect but she has an airtight alibi, which is a good thing for the career of the real Frances Lane. The police bumble around awhile while the fictional Frances Lane sings and the fictional Skitch Henderson plays the piano. The fictional Henderson hits a flat note and, of course, looks inside the piano, as the real Henderson would have never hit a flat note. There, he finds the murder weapon with plenty of fingerprints belong to the real killer. The fictional Henderson hands over the gun to the police and departs with the fictional Lane. The fictional Henders, in the style of the real Henderson, plays "Cling to Me" and "Love Me or Leave Me", and the fictional Lane sings, in the style and voice of the real Frances Lane, "A Little Bit Independent," also played by the fictional Skitch Henderson.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381879</url></doc>
