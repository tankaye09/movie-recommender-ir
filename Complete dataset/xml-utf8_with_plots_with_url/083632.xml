<plot>Dale Darling - video truancy officer, entrepreneur, television addict. After tragedy strikes in Dale's life, with a ruthless reporter at his heels trying to uncover the truth, Dale's life becomes completely consumed by the media around him. So Dale takes extreme measures to escape his reality and begins using his television as a slot machine - flipping through channels and imitating whatever program he stops on. In the meantime, he also starts drawing up plans for an exclusive community of shed housing for single men in his back yard, which runs into some snags when he discovers his back yard is, in fact, an Indian burial ground. As Dale spirals into insanity, gradually losing control over his cable-fueled mischief, it will be up to his best friends and a mysterious man named D-Rock to bring his addiction to an end before it goes too far.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083632</url></doc>
