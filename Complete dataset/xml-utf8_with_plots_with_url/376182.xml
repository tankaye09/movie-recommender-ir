<plot>After a brutal senseless high school shooting that left three teachers and eight students dead, a vengeful father kidnaps the shooter from police and takes him to an abandoned warehouse. His intention: to execute the killer himself. But he soon realizes the boy doesn't value human life and has no remorse for what he did. In his rage, the father feels he is left with no choice but to teach the killer a horrifying lesson through pain and torture, to make him realize the weight of his crimes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376182</url></doc>
