<plot>A mosaic of six stories that tell the story of the war in Kosovo from 1998 focused with compassion on the drama of human suffering and with tenacity on the reasons behind the war, massacres, genocide and manipulation. With plot lines based on the most controversial dimension of reality, the film avoids the typical cover up approach to the Balkan dilemma, the dramatic plight of refugees in the hands of Adriatic power boat operators, the soul destroying search for thousands of Kosovar "Desparecidos" the astonishing situation of Serb homeless from Krajna expelled from Kosovo, the struggle for survival in a post war scenario of devastation and intolerance, the "extermination" of democratic Kosovars by their fellow countrymen belonging to politically oriented mafioso gangs, the resistance of the Serb survivors of the KLA counter ethnic cleansing program. A searching historical, political and social inquiry into the past and the present that reveals many mysteries of a war that never ends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?297026</url></doc>
