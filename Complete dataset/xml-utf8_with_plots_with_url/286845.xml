<plot>In the third installment of the Karaoke Revolution series, it now features a Duet Mode where two singers can sing at the same time from over 35 new songs made popular by various artists. Even some of the songs are actual True Duet songs where it sounds just like the actual artists where each of them performs that part of the lyrics at different timing. There are various types of game modes of how the Duet Mode will be. There is one that the singers sing together and gather points that way, or they can try the Sing-Off mode and even the Knock Out mode for an interesting challenge. As always, depending on how well you sing at the end of each song will determine the reward you will earn.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?286845</url></doc>
