<plot>Chris Jones (Malik Yoba) is a strong, independent, black man who finds himself lost on a desolate road. Upon sighting a small, previously not there, diner, he pulls in to find help. What he finds is a pocket of life that seems to be in another era, where prejudice and intolerance are accepted, where the small minds of angry men call the shots and where one woman attempts to save him and fails. He must escape his way back to the safe confines of his truck and being lost without losing his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159573</url></doc>
