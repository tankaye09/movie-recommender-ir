<plot>I made a search for Ljiljana, my childhood, my homeland, in other words my past; it seemed that something insoluble was blocking my way. Sentimental images and memories clouded my view somewhat as I traveled through Bosnia-Herzegovina toward the sea. While tracking down our common past, I paid a visit to my homeland for the first time in eight years. The characters in this film are searching for a place of their own, a home, in the same way that I was searching for my childhood friend. My countrymen and women who fled to Vienna carry the burdens of their escape on their backs, and they later visit Bosnia in the futile hope of finding a part of their past and their homeland.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158838</url></doc>
