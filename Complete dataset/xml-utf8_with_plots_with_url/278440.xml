<plot>John Lee Hooker: Come And See About Me-The Definitive DVD presents a retrospective of film and video performance clips of the blues master from a span of over three decades beginning with 1960 Newfort Jazz Festival and culminating with an intimate solo performance recorded in the bluesman's home in the '90s. Included in the clips are performances of John Lee Hooker solo, with his band, and with a variety of guest artists including Van Morrison, Carlos Santana, Ry Cooder, John Hammond, Paul Butterfield, The Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton. Many of these performances have never been seen before. John Lee Hooker: Come And See About Me-The Definitive DVD also includes interviews with John, many of the artists he influenced and played with, and his daughter Zakiya Hooker.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278440</url></doc>
