<plot>Greg has only known Heather for two months, but he's ready to pop the question. There's just one last step before he can propose. He wants her father's blessing. Greg's never met Mr. Rothchild, but he hears the man is a bit eccentric. Mr. Rothchild quickly lives up to his reputation, telling of his crime fighting days and most importantly, his secret identity as a defender of justice. Rothchild agrees to grant Greg his blessing, under one condition...Greg must adopt his lifelong quest to defeat the evil Doctor Hammermeister. Feeling the need to appease Heather's father, Greg humors him and begins the "quest" set forth by Mr. Rothchild. 'Justice In Bloom' is a comedy that shows love is blind...unless you have superpowers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282771</url></doc>
