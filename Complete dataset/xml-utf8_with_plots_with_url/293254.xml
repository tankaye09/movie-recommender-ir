<plot>Washed-up former movie star Kirk Mannican leads an empty and delusional life. Kirk, once a tabloid favorite and top award nominee, lives in relative obscurity, unable to find work as an actor and stuck firmly in his past glory. Enter Liam. His job is to sell the Liberty Mug, a drab mug with an American Flag on it that he has promised to move. To achieve his goal, Liam tries to bring together the rap influence of Crazy T, a rapper trying to get out of Dallas; a live talk show format for a midnight mug infomercial; and Kirk Mannican's retro appeal. But everyone gets more than they bargained for during the interview show, when Kirk is finally forced to face his bitter past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?293254</url></doc>
