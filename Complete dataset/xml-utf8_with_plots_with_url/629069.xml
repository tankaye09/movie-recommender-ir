<plot>Political party conventions are not known for being memorable, except of course when they are. '68 ring a bell? For four days in September of 2008 the Republicans took over the sleepy city of Saint Paul and it became, in a very real sense, a battleground. Smoke bombs, percussion grenades, pepper spray and journalist arrests bid for attention with Policy, Palin and McCain. It was a convention unlike any other: The party of the least popular sitting president since Hoover, a hurricane, and a lot of protesters. Another new addition: an army of independent journalists covering it. Unconvention is a film about all of this, told through the eyes of the media. Ultra-Conservative, Ultra- Liberal and everything in between. This is an abstract portrait of a very concrete process, remixed into a new linear whole.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629069</url></doc>
