<plot>Show dis picture to de "tuff" Guys. This is how Patsy Mulligan makes love to his own Maggie Murphy and is up-to-date. The amorous Patsy kisses his lady-love in every conceivable manner and some of you will probably learn a trick or two from this loving couple. It is by no means a "Club Picture"--you can show it anywhere. It merely depicts a love scene between two of the lower class.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344783</url></doc>
