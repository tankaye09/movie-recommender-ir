<plot>a comic parody of our modern search for our creator. Two characters, made completely out of pipe cleaners and totally unaware that they are being controlled by outside forces, gradually begin to realize that there might be more to their existence than the cardboard world they inhabit. Should they cross the edge of the set and risk losing very thing they have known and loved, simply to find out "who did all this?".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658660</url></doc>
