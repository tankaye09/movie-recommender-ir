<plot>"American Girls" is a comedy about three teenage girls in their High school senior year, who vowed to keep their virginity till college. Guys would say that it is easier to be a woman when it comes to sex, but not in our heroes' case. Amy, Nicole, and Jennifer are probably the only girls in their high school to be known as virgins. The amazing peer pressure from their fellow seniors will push them towards adventures that no virgin has gone before.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034897</url></doc>
