<plot>Every day, Nick McCray goes through the same routine: he gets ready for work, puts on his hard hat, and gets on the bus. After work, he takes the bus home. One day, Nick's routine is interrupted when his co-worker offers him a ride home. He cautiously accepts. When they pass a golf course on the way, he has her pull over the car, and he runs out onto it. A near-accident sends Nick running home screaming. When he gets home, he interrupts his roommate Mark and his friend, who are watching a crucial baseball game. Mark is furious, and leaves. The next morning Mark has a change of heart, and does something for Nick that changes his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230036</url></doc>
