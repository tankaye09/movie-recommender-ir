<plot>The story of Alex Jacobs, an American who creates extreme-sport virtual reality games and whose ice climbing lifestyle epitomizes the adrenaline fueled worlds he is designing. Alex is forced to leave his role of the hero in his "virtual" world and face up to reality when he witnesses murder of his father, who had been working undercover in Vienna. To find out more about the perpetrators, he teams up with his father's friend Laro, a middle aged Frenchman, learning that his family history is intertwined with the Nazi Holocaust death marches. Alex discovers that his father spent his life pursuing those not only responsible for killing his ancestors but plotting the global resurgence of the Extreme Right. He must take on his father's legacy, and infiltrate a group of neo Nazis who are working with Islamic extremists on the mysterious Project Samson. Caught up in a dangerous mission to Antarctica, he is suddenly thrust into the most important game of his life - one where he cannot hit "escape" - and must deploy all his experience as a "virtual" hero to stop the biggest terrorist outrage in history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483530</url></doc>
