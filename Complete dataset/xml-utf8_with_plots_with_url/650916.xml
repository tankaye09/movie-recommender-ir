<plot>Before Bonnie and Clyde came Randolph and Eloise, a notorious couple of ruthless bank robbers and murderous outlaws. In 1868, after discovering that Eloise was with child, the young couple is forced to settle down and assume the false identity of humble farmers. On the surface, the small town of Liberty seemed like the perfect place to hide, but the couple quickly realizes the town is actually run by corrupt lawmen and cattle ranchers, proving that farming would be the least of their problems. Unable to flee, and too vulnerable to fight, the duo becomes the prey they had always hunted. Pushed to the very edge, and struggling against the very nature of their existence, the young couple must finally choose between a family life and the way of the gun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650916</url></doc>
