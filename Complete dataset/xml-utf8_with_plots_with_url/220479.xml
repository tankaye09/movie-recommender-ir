<plot>"This scene, one of the notable Aldershot series, shows the Gordon Highlanders marching back into camp after drill. The regiment has such a magnificent record that one cannot help by be interested in a close view of the men, which this picture affords. The film is so good photographically that the likeness of each man is almost equal to a studio photograph."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220479</url></doc>
