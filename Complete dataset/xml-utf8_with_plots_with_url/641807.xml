<plot>Visions of Paradise is a powerful, engaging and inspiring biopic of one of America's most loved and celebrated literary geniuses, Jack Kerouac. As Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises" defined his lost generation, "On the Road," Jack Kerouac's breakthrough novel of 1957 defined the Beat Generation. The story follows Jack's life defining moments, from his scholarship to Columbia University where he met Allen Ginsberg, his great contemporary, to Jack's long and arduous struggle for literary success, his overnight rise to fame and long, iconic reign as 'King of the Beat Generation'. Visions of Paradise explores the real life dramas about which Kerouac rarely, if ever wrote: The premature death of his sister, his fiercely protective mother, the self destruction and ghosts that plagued his soul, his struggles with alcoholism and the failure to find a comfortable transition in to middle age.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641807</url></doc>
