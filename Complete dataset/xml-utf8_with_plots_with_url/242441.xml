Wearing only her robe and slippers, she gets in her car and drives away, leaving behind her husband, Matthew, and their comfortable life in San Francisco. While Matthew tries to find her, Katherine hides away in a house on the water on Tomales Bay. Two drifters befriend her: Jake, who operates a herring boat on the bay, and Rich, a graduate school drop-out, his only crew. Jake and Rich develop a fascination for the mysterious Katherine, and their rivalry grows increasingly tense.
