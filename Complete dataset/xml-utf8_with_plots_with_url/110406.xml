<plot>The year is 1954. Jim Velasquez and Pete Guerrero are partners working at the Central Intelligence Agency. Accidentally, Jim uncovers a top secret file implicating the CIA's involvement in the Iranian coup d'etat in 1953. In order to strategize how to bring the matter to light, he decides to ask Pete for help in executing his plan. Unbeknown to Jim, Pete is more than aware of what's going on. When Pete learns of Jim's intentions, he asks him to arrange a secret hotel meeting to discuss the matter. The plot takes an unexpected turn when a deeper secret is revealed during their hotel rendezvous. At the film's climax, both Jim and Pete decide what course of action to take in order to resolve their respective disclosures. How the two men choose dramatically different measures to stay true to their allegiances, both personal and political, builds to a disturbing finale.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110406</url></doc>
