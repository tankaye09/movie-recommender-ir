<plot>Stephen Hitchcock is a divorced accountant who has a clever son, Kevin. Stephen's sister Vivian wants him to go on a blind date with a friend of hers called Sandy. They arrange a meeting in a shopping mall. Norman Byers is a computer expert. He has broken into a computer and has found some very important numbers. He arranges to hand them over to his accomplice Kelly Jordan in the same shopping mall where Stephen is supposed to meet his blind date. But Norman is chased by two shady looking guys and hasn't got time. He decides to put the numbers in Stephen's shopping bag and tells Kelly to retrieve it. When Stephen assumes Kelly is the blind date he is looking for, he takes her with him to a restaurant. Little does he know he's carrying all kinds of trouble around in his bag. Those numbers are wanted by a lot of people, or so it seems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161971</url></doc>
