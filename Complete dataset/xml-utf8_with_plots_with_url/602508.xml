<plot>In November 2006, two friends - Lucas Atkins and Shane Patterson - competed in NanoWrimo.com's annual novel writing contest, where the goal is to write 50,000 words in one month. This short documentary follows the trials, tribulations and outside influences as both friends struggle to keep up the work over the course of the longest month ever. As the novels become increasingly awful content-wise, Lucas and Shane find it difficult to find both time and energy to complete their novels. Who finishes and who doesn't? What does this mean for their motivation in life?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602508</url></doc>
