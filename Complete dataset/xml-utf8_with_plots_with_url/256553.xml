<plot>An unorthodox and unusual look into the jaws of fate, the maw of destiny and the existence and motivation of a supernatural being, this film is a quirky comedy that chronicles the journey of an eccentric family as they try to marry off their daughter. Yet, as the marriage plans go underway, for reasons unexplained yet speculated, an omnipotent force seems to oppose the wedding itself and uses all its powers to stop the wedding. Can the family battle against a force they cannot see yet is all around them, or are they just being superstitious? What ensues is Arthur Diennet's campy and strange investigation into spirituality, family, morality and most of all, the existence of "the big guy" himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256553</url></doc>
