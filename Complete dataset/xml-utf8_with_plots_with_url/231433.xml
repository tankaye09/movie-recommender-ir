<plot>This is the 20th Century Incubator. A man is seen stroking a full grown hen when she presents him with an egg much to his surprise. He feels around for more and finds them in their proper place. After having as many as he can he dismisses the hen. Breaking one of the eggs, a little chick appears. The man is delighted and tries again with equal good success and continues until each egg is now a chick. Picking up two halves of egg shells he holds them up as if to examine them and one of the chicks disappears in the shells. Each chick returns to his shell in like manner, after which the man restores the eggs to that part of the hen's anatomy from whence they originally came. Extraordinarily good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231433</url></doc>
