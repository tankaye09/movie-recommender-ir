<plot>Parents can be a demanding lot. Often it's their caring â€“ manifested through  nagging - that drives their children up the wall. But what happens when parents demand their children take care of them? Comfort Food is a short film about this role reversal. When Bill unexpectedly shows up at his daughter Jena's house, her first reaction is to drive him back to the nursing home. But as Bill clings to the idea of staying with Jena, and she pulls away, Jena is forced to confront their difficult relationship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111938</url></doc>
