<plot>This is the true story of a man named Tyler Wilkinson who was born and raised in St. George, Utah. When he was young, he had a paper route and loved to play football with his brothers. He was an ordinary person who had the cutest girlfriend whom he planned to marry after serving an LDS mission. He was an all-state football player and made many accomplishments. Then one night in February 1991, Tyler was bound for Springville, Utah to see his girlfriend preform in state competition and on the way he fell asleep at the wheel and rolled his truck. The doctors told his parents he would be paralyzed for life and almost lost hope for Tyler. Tyler did not give up and made something of his life and still accomplished many things and overcame many trials.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623178</url></doc>
