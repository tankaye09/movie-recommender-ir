<plot>In August of 2003 Bill Breithaupt was given a difficult task. He was asked to make a film for the 2003 Santa Cruz Burning Man Film Festival. Knowing he would be expected to out-do his previous film, Aqua Burn , he buckeled down and did the same thing he does every year. He packed up enough provisions to last a week and headed to Burning Man. When he returned he holed himself up in his editing room and emerged 28 days later with Burning Karma. The audience of more than 300 people were blown away. At times darker and more intense than its prequel " Aqua Burn ", Burning Karma yet maintains a focus on the incredible art installations of the year's theme ( Beyond Belief ), as well as the talented artists who conceived them, peppered with enlightening and entertaining interviews all set to a moving soundtrack. A Kubrick-like mix of powerful music coupled with stunning visuals resulting in a genius editing masterpiece. Where else would you find people sky-diving to "Ride of the Valkryies", and fire-spinning to "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087194</url></doc>
