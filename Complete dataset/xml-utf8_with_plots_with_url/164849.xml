<plot>Crass satire and cutting commentary on topical New Zealand and International issues. You can probably count on one hand the number of viewers who have not been offended by at least one item on this programme. Believe nothing. The truth is not usually out here... With made up stories about native Maori porn movies being made using public money there seems to be no boundary of good taste over which the EML crew will not step.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164849</url></doc>
