<plot>Prerna is the only daughter of the local school's headmaster. She gets to meet her childhood friend, Kumar, who is now one of the teachers at the same school. Prerna is attracted to Kumar, and admires his courage and determination to stand-up against the local and cruel zamindar, who had severely beaten-up Kumar's father several years ago. Soon both get married. Kumar is ambitious, and wants to become the head of this town. He organizes his campaign and successfully gets himself elected, not without creating some enemies. After this election, Kumar keeps busy with his new-found duties, but Prerna notices a change in him - as he is fast becoming the man he hated the most - the former zamindar.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523904</url></doc>
