<plot>The more eyes that look, the more eyes that see... Reality is among us as an endless chain of facts. Situations that are right under our noses or that are hidden waiting to be revealed. In La Liga a heterogeneous team of journalists, reporters and actors take off to live reality without prejudices. To show and explore a same fact from different angles including entertainment, irony, harshness, testimonies and drama. Each member of La Liga tries different focus on a same matter. They hunt for life stories without assumptions or accusations. The show portraits the facts without making any statements allowing the audience to arrive to their own conclusions: this is a new kind of journalism. The teamwork help us gather different points of view, and the visual and narrative construction of the stories reinforce this aim. Each one of them faces the topics in an original and relaxed way, according to their personalities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?310900</url></doc>
