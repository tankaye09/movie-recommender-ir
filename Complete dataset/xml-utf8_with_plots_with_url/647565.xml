<plot>Max Hansen is one of the greatest entertainment stars of the Weimarer Republic. With his role as waiter Leopold in the musical "Im weißen Roessl" (The White Horse Inn - Berlin 1930) he achieved public acclaim. Cabaret "rags" and his jewish decent restricted his career under Hitler's regime. During his time of emigration in Vienna, he discovered Zarah Leander, then moves on to Scandinavia and began a new life. After creating himself a new identity, he was able to acquire the "arien- certificate". However, his anxiety remained unvanquished, Hansen never returned to Germany. A personal portrait of a forgotten superstar and an impressing retrospection of the Weimar Republic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647565</url></doc>
