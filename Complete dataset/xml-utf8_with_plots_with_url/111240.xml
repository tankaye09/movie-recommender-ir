<plot>Sportscaster Bill Stern knew professional wrestling, even in the forties, was one big staged piece of choreographed fraud, but appeared to think the rest of the country thought it was real, and narrated it as such. But Gorgeous George and televison were just around the corner and clued in all but the current remaining 5% who still think it is a real sport. Bill comments while wrestlers Henry Piers, Marv Mencer, Milo Stienbor and Ed Parquette grap, grunt, grab and groan. Even if the IMDb had a Sports genre, this wouldn't qualify.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111240</url></doc>
