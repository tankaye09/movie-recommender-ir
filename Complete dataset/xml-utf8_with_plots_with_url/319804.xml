<plot>The story of four charming sisters, living in a small town with their father and grandmother (Sara Garcia). But the girls are passing their worst time, because the father, the town governor, doesn't want that his daughters go out because of his overprotecting personality. One day, the grandmother, a revolutionary warrior in the past, helps the girl to be out of the house in order to meet some guys. In a fair, the girls will meet four boys, but there will be problems because they will have to be hiding from the father, even when they're giving serenade outside of the girls house. However, the boys and the father will become friends, without being aware that, actually, they're the boyfriends of his daughters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319804</url></doc>
