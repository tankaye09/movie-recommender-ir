<plot>During William Kayfus' three tours in the Vietnam War, he shot 8mm film footage and 35mm slides; he also kept letters, cameras, medals and other objects from his Army career. By looking at his objects and recording our conversations, EYESHOT instigates an investigation of the military-mindset, which his experience generated. Without falling into a polemical debate on politics, this documentary works to explore the nature of fighting in combat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186691</url></doc>
