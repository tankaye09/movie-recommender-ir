<plot>At the height of the troubles in Northern Ireland, bombs began to go off in Guilford, Birmingham and London as Irish republican discontent flared up. A number of Irish people were wrongly imprisoned for these bombings and served long sentances. They were jailed simply because they were Irish and in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'Bossanova Blues' tells the fictional story of how three innocents could have become the victims of such a miscarriage of justice. It's a romantic road movie with dire consequences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080240</url></doc>
