<plot>The story of a pretty young waitress at a truck stop diner, who befriends an older, seemingly lonely man. Through the course of the film (4 scenes in 4 days at the same table), the older man attempts to reach out to this girl in friendship, ending each conversation about the pains of his life by asking if she would like a milkshake. On the last day she finally accepts. We then follow the waitress home and come to see that it is she who was in need of human connection; that the old man somehow knew this and directed his efforts to offer that connection she desperately craved.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370064</url></doc>
