<plot>Dr. Sunil Gupta lives a wealthy lifestyle with his wife, Aarti. Although they have been married for several years, they do not have any children. Aarti did get pregnant once, but failed to conceive. Aarti decides to travel to take a break in their Khandala bungalow, which is also in the neighborhood of Aarti's sister Vidya, her son, Raju and her husband's house. Since her bungalow is being decorated by Vinod, whom she remembers as her fellow collegian, both spend considerable time together. When Vinod finds out that Aarti is basically alone most of the time, he proposes to her - but Aarti rejects him, a physical tussle ensues, Aarti grabs a revolver, a shot is fired, Vinod falls down the stairs and dies. Vidya assists Aarti in disposing off his body. A few days later, Sunil joins them in Khandala and brings home a male who claims that he has lost his memory - the male is none other than Vinod - and Sunil's diagnosis is that Vinod will gradually regain his memory. Watch what happens when Vidya and Aarti find out and the steps they take to prevent this from happening.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?618516</url></doc>
