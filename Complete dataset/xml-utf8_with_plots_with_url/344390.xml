<plot>Mridula and Arun are a young couple, who meet accidentally, and fall in love with each other. Both come from wealthy families, and are reluctant to get married unless they find out if they are suitable for each other on a long-term basis. So they decide to live together for one year. During this process, Arun tragically passes away, leaving Mridula devastated. Time goes by and Mridula is unable to get Arun out of her mind, and keeps on seeing him everywhere. Her family feel that if she re-locates abroad, meets new people, which may assist her to heal. So she re-located to Britain. Once there, she meets with a young man, Manu, who is attentive and attracted to her. Mridula appears to be recovering, and informs her parents as such, and even agrees to marry Mano. Then the next day, her parents are shocked to see that Mridula has changed her mind about marrying Mano, and runs away from home. When she returns home, they find that she has relapsed and has begun to see Arun all over again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344390</url></doc>
