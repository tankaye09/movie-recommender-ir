<plot>After second world war the people from Ruthenia's Carpathian villages were promised a better life in Bohemia. Once settled down they felt like strangers at the new places, so memories and tales became very important reminding them of their old homes. One of these tales is about Jakub, a man who knew the bible by heart. This film follows his trace portraying the almost forgotten loss of those people who nowadays still feel without a home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273107</url></doc>
