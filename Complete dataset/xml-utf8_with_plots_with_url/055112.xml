<plot>Youth sports entertainment. Set in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, the name of the game this time is gymnastics. The focus is on the students of the prestigious Ministry of Education and Science - Republic High School For Physical Culture. Here top teachers, coaches, and students converge in a quest for both intellectual and athletic glory. These talented youngsters study hard and they play even harder. At least it seems like play as their already near-perfect physiques swing through effortless routines on the rings, high bar and floor exercise. BACK FLIP is a look at the lives of kids who are ready to go for the gold and the Eastern European sports culture that nurtures them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055112</url></doc>
