<plot>Few professional hitmen end their careers in retirement. Even fewer do so on their own terms. But after 25 years as an elite assassin, Jonas is retiring. His reputation is known in dark circles throughout the country for his quiet, deadly demeanor, his faith, and his silent ritual after each murder. For his last assignment, Jonas will compete in a race to kill against a younger, brash, cocky assassin. It is a rite of passage he himself went through as a younger man. Their target: An unintended witness to an earlier killing. But from the beginning, Jonas knows that this mission is different. The target is not a fellow criminal, but a young woman, a mother, a waitress in the wrong place at the wrong time. He must not only find her, but find her first. And the result of this mission will determine his retirement, his reprieve, and perhaps... his redemption. He holds his faith in that result within his heart... and within the vial he carries around his neck.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568254</url></doc>
