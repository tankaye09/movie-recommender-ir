<plot>The Guajará community was formed more than 200 years ago by descendants of slaves who found their freedom there. Ever since then, the inhabitants of this place in the Brazilian Amazonia have been relatively isolated from all urban contact and its progress, maintaining a way of life linked to their ancestors and fed with a series of myths about spirits and incarnations of evil. There is a sandpit near the community, a place where spirits talk and coexist with the inhabitants of Guajará since its origin. Yet, the construction of a bridge which shall join the community with the city will compromise the sandpit and will also bring a change in the vision they have of their own existence and of their own nature.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?403916</url></doc>
