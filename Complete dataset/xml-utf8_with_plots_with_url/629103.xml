<plot>"Uncut Family" focus upon a three member family that is presented in its most sensitive and raw form, right at the point where its apparent stability collapses. On the pretext of uncovering the relationship the young boy has with his mother and father, Zapas dares in the five chapters of his movie (The Son, The Father, The Mother, The Father and Son, The Holy Family) to draw attention to an endo-family sexuality which stands outside normal societal taboos, mapping a transcendental intra-family universe, painting with a regardless realism the cosmology of a contemporary world less remote than we imagine and closer than we could tolerate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629103</url></doc>
