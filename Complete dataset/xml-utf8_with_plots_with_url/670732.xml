<plot>Ma publishes books; his marriage is flat and his wife wants attention, so she arranges a photo session in bed with Si, a gay decorator, to make Ma jealous. Her friend, Linda Lo, also unhappily married, is there as well, dressed for the photos, and Si's lover is hiding in another room. Enter Henry Lo with a call girl, and Ma himself, intent on killing Si. Chance intervenes: a best-selling author and a prude, Lovely Pak, pays a call; she wants Ma to publish her books. Mistaken identities and everyone's attempt to seem conservative to please Pak lead to chaos: Si pretends to be Ma; Ma pretends to be a servant. Will Miss Pak sign a contract, and can the married couples find harmony?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670732</url></doc>
