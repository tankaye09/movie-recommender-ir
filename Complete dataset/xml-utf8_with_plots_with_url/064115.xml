<plot>A man sits in front of his TV set. The program that he does not watch is a montage of pop culture images and original footage. A loosely synchronous narrative on the evolution of man's belief systems accompanies the visual stimulation. A commentary on contemporary culture, this story examines the relationships between public information, private consciousness, and the nature of reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064115</url></doc>
