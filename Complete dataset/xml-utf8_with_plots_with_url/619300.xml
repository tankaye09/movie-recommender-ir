<plot>Windy Bear notices his son heading off for school but, after he has left, notices he forgot his school books. He chases after him with them but is distracted by a nearby river stocked with trout. He decides to go fishing but is interrupted by Truant Officer Willoughby who mistakes him for a very large schoolboy playing hookey. Afterwards, Willoughby tries various methods to get Windy to go to school and, likewise, Windy tries various methods to avoid having to go to school.
