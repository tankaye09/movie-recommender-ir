<plot>"Shows one of New York's street gamins going through various acrobatic evolutions; he turns handsprings backward and forward, walks the crab, does cart wheels and other kindred feats.

It is safe to say he will be bald-headed at an early age."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016628</url></doc>
