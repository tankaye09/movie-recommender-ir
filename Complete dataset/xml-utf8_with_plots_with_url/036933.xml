<plot>In 2006, in St-Marcel-de-Richelieu (Quebec, Canada), only 32 children are studying at the elementary school. Originally, this school was made to receive about 200 students and it is now near to close down because there are not enough students in it. Instead of taking that decision, the citizens accepted to have only 2 teachers with 2 classes of 3 different levels in each one. The main goal of that decision was to prevent the school from closing down. But now, what are the consequences of that situation? Does the teacher have enough time for everyone in her class? Is she fair for everybody? Is every child receiving an equal share of education?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036933</url></doc>
