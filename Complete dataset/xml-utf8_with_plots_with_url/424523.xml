<plot>Partners in Crime is about two burglars who are exact opposites when it comes to style, literally. Rob, the serious thief is professional, but lacks all coordination. His partner, Pedro, has all the skill, but also one major flaw - he has a love for womens clothing. Whenever he comes across womens clothing during a robbery, he drops all of his rationality and gives into temptation. So, will it be the police that break up this duo, or will it be their own differences?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424523</url></doc>
