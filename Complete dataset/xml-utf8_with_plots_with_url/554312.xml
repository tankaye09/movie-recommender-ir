<plot>Alvareen is the story of a quirky &amp; confused young woman named Alice. Alice is trying to discover why she hears different 'voices' in her mind. Through the help of an earnest, devoted friend named Kevin, the guidance of a Tarot Reader and the manipulations of the scheming Dream Mistress, Alice finds herself in the strange &amp; mysterious world of Castle Yesterday. At the Castle, a wicked wizard named Octagon confronts Alice. He magically splits Alice into two beings: her current self and her past self when she was a Warrior Goddess named Alvareen. Alvareen is a fierce, beautiful princess whose father, King Charles, was killed because of Octagon's quest for power. She is determined to avenge her name and is impatient with Alice's seeming weakness. She reluctantly teaches Alice fighting skills and together they battle both the Shadow Warriors and ultimately, each other. Throughout her journey, Alice meets a myriad of Pirates, Elves, Faeries, Trolls and many other magical and unusual creatures. At the end of the story, Alice must learn how to use her newfound powers wisely and to finally discover real love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554312</url></doc>
