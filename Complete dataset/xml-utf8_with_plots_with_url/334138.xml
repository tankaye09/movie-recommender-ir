<plot>LEWD BEHAVIOR is a fictional story based around a prestigious marketing firm called Connections Marketing. There are two sides to the Connections Marketing firm, the public side and the private side. Publicly, Connections Marketing is an establishment that has been a positive influence in the community for almost 20 years. Privately, on the other hand, there is a lewd side to Connections where one of the business partners at the firm places his female employees in compromising positions by demanding that they sleep with him for a raise or sleep with the firm's clients.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?334138</url></doc>
