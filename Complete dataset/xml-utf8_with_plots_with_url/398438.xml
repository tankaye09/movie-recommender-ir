<plot>No One Believes the Professor introduces Orpheus Augustus Marcks, a.k.a. Professor sahib: a poet, actor, philosopher, athlete, hopeful Oscar, Olympics and Nobel Prize winner who walks the line between genius and divine madness, drawing both jeers and admiration from his audience. The Professor is a man who lives in two worlds, bringing reassurance to those who surround him. A fantastic voyage with a man whose self-belief shocks even the most stubborn optimist, the film is a celebration of hope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398438</url></doc>
