<plot>The lives of six, young, Hollywood actors are turned upside down when, while filming a heist movie set in Miami, they are tricked by their enigmatic executive producer into actually stealing the diamond they are scripted to steal in the film appropriately titled 'Smokescreen'. With their freedom and more importantly their careers in jeopardy, this motley crew of actors must rely on their own personal talents as well as the guile of the films "technical advisor" James "Mirrors" McGuire, a man past his prime, recently paroled, ex-cat burglar, to turn the tables on Gavin and save their collective necks while simultaneously giving the performance of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502661</url></doc>
