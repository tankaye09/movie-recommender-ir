<plot>A scene absolutely new, in which the most unexpected effects and tricks are produced. A magician is working upon a table with seven hats, a policeman's, a soldier's helmet, a soft hat, a straw hat, a stiff hat and an opera hat. He turns them into many things, also takes from them numerous articles, such as fish, birds, flowers, etc. A very elaborate film, and we predict a great run for it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573566</url></doc>
