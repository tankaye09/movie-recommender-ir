<plot>A 13-year-old Kashmiri Pandit, Vinod, is the sole survivor of a terrorist massacre in which his entire family along with 20 others are left dead. The Divisional Commissioner of Srinagar, Shiban Lal, is forced to take Vinod home, considering the fact that there is no one to look after the child. After the government's announcement of granting the child Rs. 1,000,000 for his education, an uncle turns up to collect him. The uncle turns the child into a money making machine by using him as a crowd puller during the elections. Tormented by his uncle and aunt, Vinod runs away to Shiban Lal's house. When talks of legally adopting Vinod are started by Shiban, all hell breaks loose at his home and the media. Shiban regretfully takes Vinod to the Border Security Force's boarding school, where he will have to learn to defend himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085087</url></doc>
