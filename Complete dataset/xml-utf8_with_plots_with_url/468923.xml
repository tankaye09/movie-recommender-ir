<plot>Barbara is a successful middle aged woman - a respected architect, a great mother and wife, has good friends; leads the good life in Berlin. Out of nowhere seemingly, but definitely out of her past, Ilke appears - her daughter from a relationship with a Turkish immigrant some 25 years ago. Ilke was raised by her father, who became a wealthy businessman and educated Ilke at Europe's best schools, but without the benefit of a mother. After the Turk's death, Ilke comes to Berlin with a great deal of cash. Through a detective with mysterious contacts, one day Ilke walks into Barbara's life, and family, and is quickly accepted. However, as past details are revealed, Barbara in particular has to face what she had set aside so long ago.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?468923</url></doc>
