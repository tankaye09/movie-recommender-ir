<plot>The Answer Key is the urban fairy tale of esteemed problem-maker Joseph Strobe who is obsessed with an overdue contract for the Ministry of Education. Despite some minor domestic tribulations such as his misdirected mail, a rapacious collection agent, a suicidal plant, and the dull ache of his heart, Joe's problems are unfaltering. His work, however, is interrupted with the arrival of a self-diagnostic kit for a particularly dismal, post-industrial pestilence known as Terminal Loneliness. When Joe tests positive he finds himself faced with his greatest problem of all time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540424</url></doc>
