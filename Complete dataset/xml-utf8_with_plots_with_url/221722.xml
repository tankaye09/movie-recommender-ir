<plot>Two live-action children are playing near a grandfather clock when it comes to life and tells them of Clockland. We are then transported to an animated town populated entirely by timepieces, where we watch as a playful clock child (a pocket watch) runs into a wall and is smashed to pieces, after which he is brought to a clockmaker (a grandfather clock) who repairs the child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221722</url></doc>
