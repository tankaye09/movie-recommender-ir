<plot>The Emperor of a distant Kingdom in India is overjoyed when his wife gives birth to twin sons. Before he could announce his joy openly, his enemies, Zoravar and Shamsher, take over the castle, killing him instantly. His loyal employees, Prithvi and Dilawar, escape with the children - one son ends up with a blood disorder that discolors his skin and leaves his left arm paralyzed, and is left with a dacoit. The other son is brought up by Army Chief Prithvi Singh, while the empress herself is held captive. Years later, the sons have grown up, the one with the dacoits is called kaali Singh, while the other is called Karan. The twins come to know of each other's existence, they reunite, and free their mother. But there is one thing that divides the twin - the beautiful Princess Anuradha. Both the brothers love and want to marry her - but before she could inform them of her choice, she is abducted by Shamsher Singh, who has taken over as the new ruler, and the brothers and their clans must fight Shamsher, and then decide who is to wed Anuradha.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220440</url></doc>
