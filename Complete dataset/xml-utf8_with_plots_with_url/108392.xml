<plot>First Nations kick boxing champion Trevor "The Red Dragon" Queezenence has a problem. It's not his over-protective girlfriend, his zealous trainer or his diabetic condition - it's that he won't settle for second best. After losing a championship match to diabetic shock, Trevor vows to recover and reclaim his title. John (his trainer) shares this desire to regain glory and has spent long months helping Trevor to get back in the ring, much to the disapproval of Trevor's girlfriend Janet - a nurse who knows a thing or two about blood sugar levels, cardiac arrest and getting out while the getting's good. She also knows that Trevor is not going to listen. On the eve of his comeback bout, Trevor comes to accept the disease and it's limitations and realizes that although he can't ignore it, doesn't mean he has to give into it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108392</url></doc>
