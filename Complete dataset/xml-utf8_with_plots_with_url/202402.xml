<plot>Learning how to grow and become a better father, director Joshua Wilkinson attempts to understand and reconcile the divide inside his family going back two generations. A family that fights for peace and social justice doesn't follow the same rules at home, leading to Jeffry's resentment for being neglected by his father, Frank; Joshua's pain over his father's physical abuse of his mother; and Joshua's fear of committing their same mistakes with his own son, Benji. An intimate and moving personal journey that reveals the importance of love, comprehension and forgiveness in fatherhood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202402</url></doc>
