<plot>Each year, thousands of music industry executives, DJs and party people descend on Miami Beach for the most decadent conference in the world. They party and schmooze all the while trying to get their music heard under the South Beach sunshine. And then there's what goes on behind the scenes... Peace Love &amp; Beats follows a group of journalists as they report on the annual electronic music conference in South Beach Miami. They interview the biggest names in dance music, talk their way into the best parties, land on the red carpet at a massive awards show and sneak backstage at the biggest music festival in the country, all with fake credentials, a first-time camera crew and the threat of war looming over their heads. Featuring interviews, cameos and performances with over 50 stars in electronic music including Paul van Dyk, Paul Oakenfold, Dave Ralph, Mark Lewis, BT, lio and The Crystal Method. Peace Love &amp; Beats is a fast-paced adventure through the most exciting week in Miami</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427042</url></doc>
