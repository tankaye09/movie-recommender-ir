<plot>There was an extraordinary nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize 2005: 1000 women, working for peace without official recognition or publicity, were jointly proposed. For example Maggy Barankitse who saved in Burundi thousands of children's lives during the massacres of the civil war. Or the Indian Naseeb Mohammad Shaikh who lost her whole family during the communal riots in 2002. Now she goes from village to village to promote peace. Or the American lawyer Ellen Barry, who has been revealing human rights violations in US-American prisons for more than 30 years. - Although the 1000 women finally did not get the Nobel Peace Prize, their involvement has become visible.</plot><plot>There was an extraordinary nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize 2005: 1000 women, working for peace without official recognition or publicity, were jointly proposed.
