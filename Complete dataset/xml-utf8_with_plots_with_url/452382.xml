<plot>Five episodes about the life (or death?) sense: 1) A man is running to his girlfriend giving her a rose: the spider-woman will kill him after a great kiss: a painter will insert the body in a picture. 2) The "Myth of the cavern": a man has always seen the "life" from the door of a cavern; when he finally decide to exit from it will be eaten by the lights. Somebody will find his rests later. 3) A man lived all his life behind a wall, out of this world: when he die, in a desert, a group of "others" will condemn him to stay with everybody. 4) Some people are waiting a train but nothing will arrive in the desert station. They'll begin to walk on the tracks but gradually they'll vanish... 5) An empty and dead world: only parasites and litter, while people are stopped such as useless statues. Now, there's nothing to do: "when is going the man" ?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452382</url></doc>
