<plot>After years of performing to sold out audiences in New York City, the comedy troupe, Rash Behaviour, was invited in June of 2003 to perform their first ever shows in the southern United States. CONFEDERATE BEHAVIOUR is the video diary of that trip. It documents the group's experience with racism, homophobia, and censorship as they attempt to perform their "liberal Yankee" comedy in the heart of the Confederate south. Their struggle reaches its apex when the group is pulled from the stage in mid-performance at the Piccolo Spoleto Arts Festival in Charleston, South Carolina while they are performing a sketch that features an openly gay actor performing as an openly gay character. When asked to apologize to a crowd of thousands or face possible jail time for presenting material that they have been performing for years to sold-out audiences, the group has to decide how far will they go to stand up for their integrity, for the arts, and for freedom of speech.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113695</url></doc>
