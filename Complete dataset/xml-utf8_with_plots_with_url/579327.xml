<plot>Having contracted polio at age 22 while pregnant, Paige Dunn delivers her daughter Diana from an iron lung. Only able to move her head, Paige insists on raising Diana even after her husband divorces her. With the help of Peacie, an African-American day worker and her boyfriend La Rue, Paige and Diana weather the difficulties of living in a small town where the veneer of its residents' charity is often more wounding than not. Set in Tupelo Mississippi during the summer of 1964, events take a dramatic turn when La Rue encounters peril during his political efforts in this Freedom Summer, and social services discover the extent of Diana's involvement in her mother's care. Based on a true story, Paige's kindness, wisdom and selflessness, fate, and Diana's ingenuity, lead to an unexpected inspiring finale.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579327</url></doc>
