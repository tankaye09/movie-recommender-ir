Martha singing "Last Rose of Summer." 5. Good Night Quartette. This film shows a quartette of well-known opera singers acting and singing their parts in this ever popular opera. The subject are taken with the greatest care and the films manufactured by the Edison Manufacturing Company. Managers can arrange to produce this exhibition throughout the country and can obtain a quartette of church singers to remain behind the scenes and sing the parts and produce a remarkably fine entertainment, besides giving a local interest to the same by utilizing local talent. If it is desired to do so, however, the quartette can be engaged to travel with the exhibition.
