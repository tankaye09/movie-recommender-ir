<plot>A groundbreaking series about the lives of ordinary Israelis and Palestinians, "Ordinary People" is among the most ambitious joint Israeli-Palestinian productions to date. Each episode follows a simple formula - the story is played out in one day and tracks three conflicting characters that come into contact with each other during the 24-hour period. The result is a fascinating, fresh and insightful look at the stories of the day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415316</url></doc>
