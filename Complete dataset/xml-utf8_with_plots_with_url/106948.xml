<plot>This picture was taken from the Court of Fountains. Here we present a view of the Exposition grounds as the visitor would see them while standing at the base of the electric tower and looking south. The camera was put in motion while the lens was looking eastward toward the Manufacturers' and Liberal Arts Buildings. The camera is slowly revolved from left to right, making a semi-circle and bringing within its field the following points of interest in their repsective order: The Court of Cypresses, the Ethnology Buildings, the Cascades, the Esplanade Fountains, the east and west Esplanade band stands, the Triumphal Bridge and Fore Court, the east and west Piers, which mark the official entrance to the Fair grounds. These piers, we may add, are the master-pieces of architecutre at the Pan-American Exposition, representing Peace and War, and containing numerous pieces of small statuary, each expression some phase of American greatness. They are surmounted by four immense pieces of statuary. Having passed the piers at the main entrance, the rose gardens, the bridge cascades, the Mines Building, the East Esplanade Fountains and the Court of Lilies come into view. The Court of Lilies being on the east side of the Exposition grounds directly opposite the Court of Cypresses, our scene here ends, the Court of Lilies and the Court of Cypresses being the east and west objective points of this semi-circular picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106948</url></doc>
