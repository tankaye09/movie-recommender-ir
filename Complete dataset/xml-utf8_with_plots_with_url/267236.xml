<plot>This gripping documentary profiles German cannibal Armin Meiwes (also know as The Cannibal of Rotenburg), who made headlines around the world when he was convicted of killing and eating another man, Bernd Brandes. The film includes exclusive interviews with Meiwes from prison, alongside home video footage and a look at the police evidence used to convict the cannibal. The film also visits the house where Meiwes slaughtered, cooked and consumed his willing victim over the course of several months before being captured.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267236</url></doc>
