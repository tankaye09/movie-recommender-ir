<plot>Alex Wilder (not Tina Vitorri as previously publisised) is a young professional on the verge of marriage. While on a trip through Kansas on morning, she is caught in twister and taken away to the land of Oz, where she meets Caleb, a WWII fighter pilot (call sign "Scarecrow") who somehow ended up there during an aerial fight (and believes it to be 1943). Together they end up in an under-water city where they meet Bellaridere, who gives them the task of rescuing Ozma, who has been kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West. Journeying through Oz, they encounter the Wheelers, the remains of the Munchkin village and several other familiar Oz locations. Upon finding Ozma in her labyrinth (where she has been enchanted by the WWotW) they come to realise that should they kill the witch, Alex will become the new Wicked Witch. Using the twister to send the Witch far away, they return the now useless Ozma to Bellaridere and realise they are now stuck in Oz.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343811</url></doc>
