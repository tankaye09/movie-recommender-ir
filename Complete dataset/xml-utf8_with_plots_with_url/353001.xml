<plot>Kishen a small village boy,finds himself transported to his married step sister Kadambini after his widowed mothers death. Kadambini takes her brothers responsibility with the intention of possessing his small village properties. Her husband, Nobin, accepts this arrangement and turns a blind eye to the ill-treatment that Kishen suffers. The other members of the household are Nobin's younger brother, Bipin and his wife Hemangini, a noble lady, large hearted, gentle and ever righteous. Kadambini wanted a nuclear family and she succeeded in dividing the ancestral property. Meanwhile, Kishen is treated as a servant and Hemangini cannot tolerate his suffering at the hands of the cruel Kadambini. Kishen's entry into Bipin's portion of the house was also now restricted. Hemangini falls seriously ill, and Kishen is horrified to find that she seems to be ailing from the same illness that caused his mother's death. Desperate that he may lose the only person in the world who loves him, Kishen, in his own childish way, tried to find a cure for her-only to attract further retribution at Kadambini's hands. As a last resort, Hemangini decides to leave the village along with Kishen. Her unexpected action shakes her husband's complacency, and Bipin rushes after Hemangini to persuade her to return home. He assures her that no power on earth would disrupt the household, and that she and Kishen would live in contentment as brother and sister.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353001</url></doc>
