<plot>The story revolves around the life of an aging man faced with the disappointment of a life spent chasing a dream. The ambition to become a star was what drove him to Hollywood but broken dream after broken dream turned him into a helpless clown reduced at holding a sign on a street corner advertising fried chicken. Glimpses of his life as he rubs elbows with the stars are only a distant memory from his past that are of no consolation to him anymore. His crazy drunken landlord makes it a habit to pester him in any way possible. And his boss at work is not too happy about the way he holds the sign and threatens to fire him. Even suicide fails when a stranger interferes. As a last resort he hopes to find some consolation between the arms of a prostitute. Will he get his "Happiending"? Not before the man who saved his life realizes that by interfering with death he will get a first hand taste of the old man's life and sorrows.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229395</url></doc>
