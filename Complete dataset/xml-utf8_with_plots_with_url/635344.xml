<plot>Detective John Valentine is interrogating a teenage girl for being in a car with a drunk driver. When the girl's older sister (Laura) comes for her, an instant attraction develops thus prompting Detective Valentine to send his life in another direction, a place he's not sure that he wants to go. As his courting of Laura glides through some awkward phases, she is also faced with the fact that although he is not what she has been looking for, there is something about Detective Valentine that is undeniable to her. The romance, discovery and actions of the characters then flip the story: sending it into another direction, one that will effect the lives of all involved with Detective Valentine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?635344</url></doc>
