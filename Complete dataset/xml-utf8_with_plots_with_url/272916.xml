<plot>Gangaram Verma has worked for the local municipality for several years, and is known in the community for being honest. Contractors' many attempts to bribe him have all been in vain. One of the contractor's, Prem Kumar, decides to teach Gangaram a lesson. He hires Gangaram's only son, Vijay, in his office, and subsequently gets him married to his only daughter, Sapna. The three then scheme to get Gangaram to trust them, and upon doing so, they get him to sign his property to them, leaving Gangaram and his wife, Laxmi, homeless. Vijay and Sapna bring up their son, Ravi, and tell him that his grandparents are dead. Years go by, then one day Ravi comes across a coolie who resembles his grandfather. He follows him home, and gets to hear the truth from his lips, and decides to treat his mom and dad the same way they treated his grandparents, with shocking results.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272916</url></doc>
