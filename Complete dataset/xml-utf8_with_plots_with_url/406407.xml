<plot>Denise has been slaving away as an obit writer for the Tribune, dying for her chance to become a reporter. One of the tribune's writers has recently died of old age, and Denise jumps at the opportunity to take over his job, tactlessly hounding her boss, ROGER, in the midst of the funeral. That night, unable to sleep, Denise goes for a late-night jog...where she stumbles upon a dead body and promptly faints from the shock. When she comes to, amidst all the police activity, Denise spots SIMON, her rival and one-time lover, performing his new reporting duties. The next day, Denise's friend and coworker, LUKE, informs her of the name of last night's victim. Shocked, Denise realizes that she saw the deceased's obituary in a newspaper last night, before the time of death. But when she tries to track down the article, it's nowhere to be found. Soon, Denise's computer displays a mysterious message: another obit. But when she tries to print she ends up with blank paper, and the message erases itself. Sure enough, the next day the woman turns up dead. Denise knows she has no proof of what's happening to her, so she begins her own investigation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406407</url></doc>
