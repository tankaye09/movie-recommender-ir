<plot>The film follows 4 young Brazilians from a village that was just recently discovered by tourists. It shows the immense influence that the tourists have over the lives of the locals, and the difference between the way the tourists conceive the locals and the reality that is filmed. The arrival of foreigners to the village has created a new variety of options for self fulfillment, that doesn't go hand in hand with the economical and social possibilities of the locals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210694</url></doc>
