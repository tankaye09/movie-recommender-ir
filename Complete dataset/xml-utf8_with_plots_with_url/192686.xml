<plot>Would you go out into the woods and live with ferns for thirteen years? Probably not, because that's a just plain stupid thing to do! It didn't stop Tommy Turntable! Tommy Turntable videotaped himself living with ferns for thirteen years, until he was killed. The videotape has been edited together in this wonderful documentary by Austrian director, Ahnuld Schwartzenburgen. Contains interviews with Tommy's parents, Tommy's friends, and others who didn't have anything to even do with the story. ALSO: Includes a brief appearance by day-time talk show host, Dr. Bill! NOTE: By documentary, I mean MOCKumentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192686</url></doc>
