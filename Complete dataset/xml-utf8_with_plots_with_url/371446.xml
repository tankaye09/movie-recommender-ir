<plot>Miranda is working her way through law school as an exotic dancer. When a young lawyer comes into her club for his birthday celebration, she decides to attempt to get a job as a legal assistant at his firm. The catch is, she can only do it during a private dance without being caught by the management... meaning she must continue dancing even as she engages in a verbal battle of words about her qualifications.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?371446</url></doc>
