<plot>George Nez is the father of a Navajo family. He starts to occasionally drink with friends, coming home to a tongue-lashing from his wife Nellie. A gifted silversmith, he gradually begins to neglect his work, which provides much of the family income. Then he begins to sell off horses, goats, and pawn his silver jewelry to pay for his habit. His Uncle Bitaani chides him, and George strikes the old man causing him to become ill, stop eating, and finally die "of a broken heart." Nellie begs George to stop drinking, but this drives him even more to drink. Seeing no alternative but to lose him, she starts to drink with him. With only daughter Billie, an older son, and old Aunt Dezba to look after the needs of the younger children, they face going hungry in the harsh winter cold.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072249</url></doc>
