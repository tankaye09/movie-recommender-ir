<plot>Two very intelligent but very unbalanced addicts, just graduated from high school and lost in a world of drugs, decide to find a past time to occupy their minds and fill their direction-less days. Researching paranormal events piques their interest and their research leads them to a haunted and now abandoned hospital in their area. For the hell of it, they decide to post their findings on the Internet. Unexpectedly, their article gets bought by a major magazine, earning them a big pay check, a grant, and keys to the hospital to continue their research. They take the money and do what any other stoner teenager in their position would do: they throw a party. Many miscellaneous drugs and several hits of acid later, all of their nightmares begin to turn to stark reality, and a terrible host of inner demons comes to life. In the dark hallways of the abandoned hospital, they prove that compared to anything paranormal, human nature is darker by far.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356308</url></doc>
