<plot>Many Canadians don't realize that Canada was home to 40,000 German prisoners of war during the Second World War. Hitler's Canadians chronicles the experience of these POW's; the transition from warrior to captive, and their obsessive, often comical attempts to get back to Germany. Canada's effect on the POWs did not stop with their return home. After the war, several hundred former prisoners returned to Canada to build new lives and raise families in the country that once was their prison.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241816</url></doc>
