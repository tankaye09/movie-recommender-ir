<plot>Wretched is a culmination of both, the personal experience and the interpretation through the influential readings. This is a story of a black man bred in a white world, disassociated from his own race, desperately trying to reconnect with his roots, while finding himself attracted only to white women due to his assimilation to the host society. It deals with the dichotomy of the colonized and the colonizer, the struggle, and the desire to belong, all depicted in a commonplace setting, a caf√©, that enables the viewer to identify with the inner turmoil of the protagonist with ease. This film was shot in 35mm colour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661549</url></doc>
