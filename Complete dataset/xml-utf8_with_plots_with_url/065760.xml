<plot>Taken at a time when the Kronprinz was inspecting the Berlin Fire Department. In the background is seen the front of a high building. Ladders of various kinds are shown placed against it and hung from its numerous windows. Ropes are also seen hanging from the roof. A large body of men rush toward the building, scale the ladders, climb the ropes and disappear through the windows. At the word of command, they return to the ladders and ropes, and soon reach the ground, returning on a run to the starting point. Scene now changes to a fire run. Each fireman as he passes salutes the Prince. As the bugler gives the command, the hose is stretched and the engines are started pumping. Great volumes of smoke rise in the air from their smokestacks. The firemen raise the ladders and, after running the hose up to the roof of a building, proceed to put out an imaginary fire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?065760</url></doc>
