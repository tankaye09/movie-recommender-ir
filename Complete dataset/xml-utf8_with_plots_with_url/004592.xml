<plot>As we speak the world's leading scientists are working on a billion dollar quantum machine that may open black holes through to parallel worlds. 28 entertains the idea that this has already happened. The result of a quantum teleportation experiment, The Nurse is trapped in a living hell, traveling from one parallel world to another. He is unable to form relationships due to the limited time he spends in each world. His only goal is to detach himself from reality with a powerful toxic drink. However a sinister vagrant within a depraved bar have other plans for him. For millennia man has fantasized about immortality, but is it a blessing or a curse? Only quantum science has the answers.</plot><plot>As we speak the world's leading scientists are working on a billion dollar quantum machine that may open black holes through to parallel worlds. 28 entertains the idea that this has already happened.
