<plot>Jakub Lucius Roll (18) set the story of good against evil in an atheist country, EU, where people only get into trouble for their good deeds. The main character ends up lonely and made fun of. The question, why this is still happening in a world so full of technology is one that the author doesn't want to solve or even answer . He lives in this type of a world and feels that he should share his observations with us. Come to understand this obligatory topic in central Europe, in Prague, where he set his story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354277</url></doc>
