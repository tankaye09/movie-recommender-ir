<plot>"Burn Off" tells the tale of Peter Hansen, a fit man who closely watches his weight like a stockbroker watches his stocks. He marries a fit woman who within a year becomes a fat woman. His desire for her and himself to become the perfect weight leads him to a diet drink called "Burn Off," which does and does not do what it advertises: the user loses weight but also loses all sense of reasoning. Peter doesn't know whether to blame the drink or himself for turning into a sadistic murderer and keeping his wife a prisoner in his basement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087129</url></doc>
