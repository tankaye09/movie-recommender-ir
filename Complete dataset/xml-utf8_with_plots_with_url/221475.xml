<plot>"Here we see Philadelphia's own G.A.R. [Grand Army of the Republic] veterans about to decorate the graves of their fallen comrades. Can anything be more touching than to see bands of gray-haired warriors, some with only one leg or one arm, marching proudly to strew flowers on the graves of departed ones? They seem to ignore all sorts of weather in order that they may pay tribute to those who defended their country at the cost of their lives. This is a grand and brilliant picture."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221475</url></doc>
