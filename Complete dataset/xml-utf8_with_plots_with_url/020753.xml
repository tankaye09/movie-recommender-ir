<plot>Vikranth comes from an upper-class family. As he is of marriageable age, his parents want him to get married. He then meets with Archana and both fall in love, and both inform their respective families, who, in turn, meet the prospective bride and groom, give them their approval and blessings, and both are then married. After sometime of living in harmony differences start up between the two, and start to snowball thereafter. Vikranth thinks he acted in haste when he married Archana, and regrets his decision of marrying her. One day he meets with another young lady, and both fall in love with each other. When Archana finds out, she is very upset and wants Vishal to chose between her and his new girlfriend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020753</url></doc>
