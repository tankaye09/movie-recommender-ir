So far, the couple's longing for kids remains unfulfilled, even artificial insemination hasn't been successful. Of course it doesn't help that Hans-Jörg has to go on a training course exactly when their next appointment is due. During his absence Flora starts an affair with her neighbor Paul, a writer with writers block. Paul fancies Flora to be his muse, and even Flora blossoms in his company. Soon after her husband's return the couple agree to adopt a child but then Flora discovers she is finally pregnant. But by whom?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203662</url></doc>
