<plot>In a city park, a young man walks up to a young woman. She's sitting alone on a concrete bench that circles a statue. There are lots of empty places near her to sit. She's reading. The young man verbally assaults her, telling her that she's sitting in his seat and that she needs to move. When she ignores him, he gets physical - then, he discovers he's underestimated her. But, what's really happening here? Are archetypal forces at work in her imagination?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215558</url></doc>
