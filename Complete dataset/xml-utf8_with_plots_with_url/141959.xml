<plot>Part:1 In 1966, Saul Lennewitz received a radio transmission unlike anything ever heard before. He recorded his observations on audio reels containing over 140 hours of documentation. The United States Government has withheld these recordings from the pubic domain for over 30 years. Due to the Freedom of Information Act, these recordings were released in 1999. The U.S. Government denies their disinformation campaign targeted at Dr. Lennewitz and refuses to comment on the validity of the tapes. Part:2 1966 - end. Found footage from the past twenty five years exposits the paranoiac fears inherent in all humans. Themes of race, religion, warfare, technology and conspiracy are explored.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?141959</url></doc>
