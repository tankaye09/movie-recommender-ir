<plot>Nobody Gets Hurt is a story about a father and son dealing with the son's past of making poor choices. The son's insistence that he's not hurting anybody turns into the realization that there are many people affected by his choices. Ben Turner stars as a teenager having trouble communicating with his father. The father is at the end of his rope trying to convince his son to improve his behavior, but can't get past his own anger and frustration. The intense drama that unfolds delivers a strong message about choices and consequences. The ending definitely gives the viewer something to think about.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?399257</url></doc>
