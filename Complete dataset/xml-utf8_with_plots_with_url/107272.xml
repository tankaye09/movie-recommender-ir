<plot>During the Korean War, two marines find themselves alone after a mortar attack decimates their platoon. One marine is two days away from discharge, and the other is a new recruit who has just started his tour of duty. As they attempt to finish their mission and make their way back to base camp, the new marine begins to deteriorate mentally and emotionally. As he becomes more imbalanced, he steals the identity of his fellow soldier and plans to return home in his place.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107272</url></doc>
