<plot>The story of each unique destination is told through interviews with guests, charter operators, dive shop owners, boat captains, dive masters and others. Of primary interest to most divers of course is the underwater footage. Taking advantage of the high resolution of Sony's HDV format, Hi Def Pictures captures the underwater beauty of these locations with breathtaking clarity. The camera is often mounted atop a Diver Propulsion Vehicle, adding to the excitement and range of footage captured. "Diving Roatan" highlights include footage from Mary's Place, Bear's Den, the wreck of the Odyssey, Melissa's Reef, West End Wall, and Canyon Reef. The Roatan DVD also includes footage of two unique diving opportunities; a shark feeding dive and a dolphin interaction dive. Land based activities profiled in the DVD include a trip to the Gumbalimba Eco Park to see tropical monkeys and colorful birds, as well as a zip line jungle canopy tour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152520</url></doc>
