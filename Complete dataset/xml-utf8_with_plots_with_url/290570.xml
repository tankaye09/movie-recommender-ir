<plot>Ranvir Singh is in the employ of Raiszada Hukamchand, who is involved in criminal activities. One day Raiszada kills a man named Victor, and asks Ranvir to take the blame for this crime, for which he offers to pay him a lot of money. Ranvir agrees to do so only after Raiszada gives him a written confession, which he does. Thereafter Ranvir switches his clothes with that of the dead man, and they burn the place down. The dead man is identified as Ranvir Singh by the police, and his family, Mrs. Ranbir Singh, daughter, Geeta, and son, Sumer Singh, are informed of this tragedy. Years later, Sumer comes to know that his father is still alive, and under the name of wealthy Girdharilal, who is married to gorgeous Latika. When Sumer approaches him, he denies being or ever knowing anyone by the name of Girdharilal. Sumer then decides to expose him, little knowing that he is putting his life, as well as the lives of his mom and sister in danger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290570</url></doc>
