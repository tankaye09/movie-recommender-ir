<plot>Based on a true story. Two doctors are on the brink of the biggest medical breakthrough in cancer treatment until a conspiracy involving the FDA and American Medical Association sabotages and shuts down research and funding for the drug because the doctors would not sell it to the pharmaceutical companies. The government tries to discredit the doctors in what turns out to be one of the biggest medical trials in US history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?561544</url></doc>
