<plot>Bjarne and Bibi are constantly on the road between seaside hotels on the west coast of Denmark where they have tried to be a success with their songs and music for many years. They are a couple off and on stage, but things aren't going too well. Bjarne is fed up with this race, he wants a small house and an ordinary life with a wife and child. Bibi is struggling to build a career and become a star, a struggle that makes her bitter and self-righteous. It's time for a showdown. Not least with oneself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411305</url></doc>
