<plot>Scientist, Alexander Tom (Stan Harrington) thought he had it all, great wife, great house, career... that was until the death of his best friend and a random affair with an anonymous woman (Blythe Metz) force him to re-evaluate everything. In the ensuing days his relationships with his father (John Saxon), his wife (Red), his co-worker (Joe Guarneri) and Walela, the mysterious woman, contribute to his edification that life is riddled with intangibles, that complacency and routine have deadened him and that despite his scientific understanding of life, there are other forces at play.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550768</url></doc>
