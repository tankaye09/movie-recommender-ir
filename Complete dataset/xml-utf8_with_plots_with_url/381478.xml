<plot>Explores the relationship between Pun, a young man who is paralyzed from the waist down after an accident, and Ake, the male nurse who takes care of him, and of course Pun's father. Pun is at first cold towards his nurse Ake, but as Ake continues to earnestly take care of him he starts to open up his heart through candid conversations. The physical contact with Ake makes him rethink physical desires that he wants to forget. The grudge he held against his father slowly abates. All of this slowly becomes the motivating factor to confirm that he is alive, albeit with physical problems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381478</url></doc>
