<plot>Johnny Mack (Johnny Mack Brown ) is hired by Lois Benton (Virginia Carroll)as a hand on her ranch, formerly run by Daley, who is in jail on a payroll theft charge. Despite the warning for foreman Rusty Steele (Raymond Hatton), Johnny sees real estate agent Kirby (Bill Kennedy), who wants to buy the Benton ranch. When Johnny refuses to align with Kirby, he is forced to knock out henchman Moran (Marshall Reed) in a fist fight. Rusty finds on henchman Harris (Forrest Matthews), when he is caught spying on the ranch, half a map revealing the location of the missing payroll. Johnny tells Rusty he is an undecover Wells Fargo agent, and with Rusty's aid tricks KIrby into admitting he has the other half of the map. Lois is kidnapped by the outlaws, and the outlaws agree to free her in exchange for the half of the map Rusty now has. Kirby, once he has the other half, refuses to let Lois go until the pay chest has been located, and holds Johnny and Rusty prisoners. They escape, rescue Lois and Johnny captures the gang when they dig up the chest. Lois finds a written agreement in the chest that proves Daley was not involved, and reveals that Daley is her father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?618080</url></doc>
