<plot>Suicidal youth SSR is found half-dead on train tracks by Sivaji Ganesan, who nurses him back to health and helps him get a job. Friendship between the two strengthens, but problems appear once SSR marries a Maharashtrian girl (K.R.Vijaya) and the three live under the same roof. In a parallel plot, SSR's simple-minded young sister (Savitri) is slandered by a local hoodlum (M.R.Radha), and thereby repeatedly turned down by suitors for being a woman of loose character. The situation calls for the rescue-capable shoulders of Sivaji! Wholesale melodrama, ridicule of North Indians, and some gratuitous hugging between men (which seems to have been the norm back in the day, in Tamil cinema)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284215</url></doc>
