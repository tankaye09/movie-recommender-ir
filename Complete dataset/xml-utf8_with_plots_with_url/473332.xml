<plot>Jodi's plan was simple: assemble the best drag kings sexual favors could buy, teach them the most complicated line dancing they'd ever seen, and put on the best drag king act Chicago had ever known. But as most plans go, things aren't always that simple. Sebastian Cock, in the lead role, is quick to remind everyone of his not-so-recent pageant title. His understudy, Skid Mark, seems to be mastering the choreography more quickly than him, but will anyone ever notice? The "back-up dancers," as Sebastian refers to the rest of the cast, are becoming more disgruntled by the day, and all the stress seems to be affecting Jodi's already disjointed disposition. Will everything miraculously work itself out before the big show? Or will the nature of the beast win out this time?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473332</url></doc>
