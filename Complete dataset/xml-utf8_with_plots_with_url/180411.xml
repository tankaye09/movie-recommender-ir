His father is a pathologist in the morgue who's been analyzing the numerous amounts of murders in the town. His mother's death has been extremely difficult for Chris and all he wants to do is find out who's responsible. On his way to a therapy session, he gets into a near accident with a girl who he finds very attractive.
