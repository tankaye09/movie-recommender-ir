<plot>They play the moms and dads, the police captain or the trusted best friend. They are the "journeyman" or "blue collar" actor and sometimes, the ones you love to hate. They show up, do their job and go home. Their importance to a successful film or television show can't be measured and without them the stories would be impossible to tell. We see them on the big and small screen every day. We recognize their faces, but don't know their names, yet their influence on us is remarkable. In Character documents the many stories from these incredible individuals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261484</url></doc>
