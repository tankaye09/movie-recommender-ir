<plot>This is the story of John "Jack" Elkman, a divorced father of three. Once a bestselling novelist, Jack has found himself in self-imposed exile, with only his children and three best friends as contact with the outside world. For three years, Jack has suffered from writer's block, and his royalties are steadily shrinking.

With his head stuck firmly in the sand, Jack would give anything to be able to write again. In the "be careful what you wish for" motif, Jack suddenly finds himself with the best possible news at the worst possible time: a Hollywood studio has offered a deal to film his novel, Calling Gotham, and its sequel. Two slight problems: Jack has never gotten around to writing the sequel, and now he only has three weeks in which to do so. Finding himself relying on the kindness of family and friends against his will, Jack finds his universe expanding when his friends hire Jamie, a former army officer-turned-nanny who happens to be gay. Jamie reminds Jack that life is indeed out there, and Jack - after three long years - finally begins to write again.
