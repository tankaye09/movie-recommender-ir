<plot>Landscape architect Jan Dijkstra has a dream: the introduction of new nature on a scale which would actually no longer be possible in The Netherlands. When he is sent to Poland he grabs his chance and starts to work on creating a large nature reserve river which man will exert no control. In doing so he takes little account of the feelings of the local people involved, and as a result he soon finds himself in difficulties. His interest in wolves adds another complication. Although wolves are a protected species in Poland, the farmers still hate them. Jan gradually loses interest in the original reason for his being in Poland. His younger colleague, David, has to step in and put things right. David is told to fire Jan, but David is rather relieved when it proves difficult to make any real contact with Jan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530477</url></doc>
