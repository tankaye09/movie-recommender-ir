<plot>A tall, dark, handsome angel watches over the urban landscape deluged by the whispered yearnings of the city dwellers below. The weight of the world on his shoulders, the feathers of his exquisite wings fluttering in the breeze. A short, fat (but quietly confident) angel arrives, interrupting this calm. The tall angel nods hello and then notices the size of his partner's wings. They are magnificent, enormous, trailing almost to the floor. Not quite believing his eyes, the tall angel reaches out to touch them to see if they are real, then looks at his own tiny buds in comparison, unable to hide his annoyance. Unruffled, the well-endowed angel gazes smugly over the city.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658016</url></doc>
