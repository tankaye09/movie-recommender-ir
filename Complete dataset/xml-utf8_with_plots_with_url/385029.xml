<plot>Britt Arthur never met her Uncle Bluey and her family never talked about him. He left the family thirty years ago and she had to travel a thousand miles to find him. When she got there, she found that her Uncle was living in an Aboriginal community. He had found a new family, he had been initiated into their culture and he was allowed to visit their sacred sites. 'My Uncle Bluey' is a personal story about the things that tear families apart, what brings them back together, and how your family is always your family. Always.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385029</url></doc>
