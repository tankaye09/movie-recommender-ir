<plot>A decided hit. Who ever saw a Chinese dance? Very few of us. If you buy this film you will have something to overwhelm your competitors with. It brings to mind the dainty and delicious "chop souee" and "jock-a-mai" served in the Chinese restaurants. See this dance, "hit the pipe," eat a dish of that Chinese mixture and in their language of the street, you will be a Chinaman, "for fair." The dance is comical in the extreme. John Chinaman calls on his friend, Half Lung, and tells him a funny story. They enjoy it so much together that it starts them dancing in real Chinese fashion. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103691</url></doc>
