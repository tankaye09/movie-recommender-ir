<plot>Four years ago, Hunter Wilde and his best friend Jack Stapleton drove off to grab a bite to eat. The two were hit by a drunk driver and in the chaos and shock of the moment, Hunter made a rash and detrimental decision - instead of waiting for an ambulance, he took matters into his own hands and rushed his injured friend to the hospital. Jack died in transit. Racked by guilt over his friend's death, Hunter disappeared, cutting off contact with everyone he knew and loved. Now, Hunter is finally ready to return home. But his unannounced return forces him to examine his choices as he faces those he, and Jack, abruptly left behind: Jack's girlfriend Margo and Jack's family. Hunter returns seeking forgiveness from those he hurt, but ultimately learns that forgiveness and redemption are found closer than he realized.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657124</url></doc>
