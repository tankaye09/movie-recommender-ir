<plot>Idomeneo, King of Crete, one of the great heroes during the total destruction of the famous city of Troy,was sailing back to his realm, when a terrible storm broke loose near the city of Sidon.The storm was of such violence that in his fear made a solemn promise to Neptun,God of the sea, to sacrifice the first person-no matter who it be-that he would meet on the shore if he and his people would only get there safely. Idamantes, his son,had heard the rumors about the sinking of his beloved father's ship.In his deep grief he was hastening to the shore, hoping that the rumors would turn out to be wrong.He so happened to be the first person his father met in his lone search for the promised sacrifice along the shore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256452</url></doc>
