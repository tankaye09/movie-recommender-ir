<plot>Coming Home recounts the personal story of Herb Sennett who served as an infantry officer in South Vietnam during the years of 1969 to 1970 where he worked as an adviser to the South Vietnamese army. He arrived a happy go lucky kid with a big smile on his face. But when he left, his life had been changed in such a way that he questioned the decision making processes of his own government for nearly 35 years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112120</url></doc>
