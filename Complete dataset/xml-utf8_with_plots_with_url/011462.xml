<plot>Identically dressed and with sibling-like resemblance, performance artists Trevor Martin and Kym Olsen shift between spoken word and athletic dance choreography in a collection of 29 scenes. Set in various locations - including a gymnasium, an abandoned hospital, and a trailer park circus - Martin and Olsen slip between a ventriloquist and his dummy, a seducer and his surrogate, a doctor and his patient, and synchronized dance partners. The film examines a complex social psychology - questioning the colonization of the human body for various political, medical and religious agendas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011462</url></doc>
