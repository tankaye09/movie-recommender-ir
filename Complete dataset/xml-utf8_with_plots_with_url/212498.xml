<plot>In 2000, the US Government opened up GPS technology to the general public. That day, a man in Oregon hid something in the woods and posted the GPS coordinates on the Internet. Just a couple of days later, somebody found the cache and that was the start of Geocaching. With nearly a quarter of a million caches hidden around the world, Geocaching is a hobby that can keep you busy. A Geocacher visits www.geocaching.com to download GPS coordinates and hints to find a cache. Armed with a GPS device, Geocachers go out in search for these little treasures. Caches may vary in size from a thimble to a large ammo box, and may be hidden anywhere--behind a sign in a busy metropolitan city or under a log in the middle of the woods. This film explores this new hobby through the eyes of three geocachers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212498</url></doc>
