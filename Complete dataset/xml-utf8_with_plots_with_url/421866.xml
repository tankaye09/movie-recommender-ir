<plot>The view from a moving train shows some of the Westinghouse interests and the surrounding areas. It appears that the film is in two parts and has been incorrectly spliced together with the last part put first. The film is supposed to show one rail route, but maps indicate that the first part of the film logically should be placed last. The first part of the film shows the Turtle Creek train station followed by buildings, homes, train yards, and industrial buildings, possibly the Westinghouse Air Brake Company. It passes by another station which appears to be Pitcairn. The second part of the film shows the Westinghouse Machine Co. buildings followed by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. buildings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421866</url></doc>
