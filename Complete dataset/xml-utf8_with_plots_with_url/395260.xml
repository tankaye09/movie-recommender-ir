<plot>It happens in the middle of the 19th century, the last famine-stricken period in Europe (1845 - 1849). A woman in her middle period of life, who lives with her husband in poor circumstances, is awakened by odd noises coming from the room below. When she has groped her way downstairs in the dark, she sees her husband standing at the table and looking at her in a frightened way. Clumsily he hides something behind his back, stammering apologies and excuses. At last, when she returns to bed, he removes his hand. Holding a piece of bread which he has sliced off secretly. The next morning she hands him over one of her three slices of bread. He gives it back humiliatingly blamed. He says that she cannot eat only two pieces of bread. They start quarreling.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?395260</url></doc>
