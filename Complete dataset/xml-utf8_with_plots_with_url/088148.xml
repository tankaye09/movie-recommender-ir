<plot>Have you ever thought about what it's like to die? How it would feel or where you would go? A young woman's quest for answers begins as she takes you on a journey through her experience with life after death. Upon waking up from a car accident, "The Girl" recognizes that something has gone wrong and struggles to find out what has happened. She begins reliving experiences in her past through the counsel of her inner child and her higher power, the "Professional Man." Together, they help the young woman come to terms with what it means to die and assist her in the search for answers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088148</url></doc>
