<plot>After breaking the news with the arrest of Thomas Hastings, the suspect of the abuse and murder of two children in a Monday morning, the asthmatic photojournalist Aaron Dougherty becomes the sensation in the ACN News Organization, being congratulated by the director Adele Ransom. He celebrates in a night-club, and wakes-up in a field in the middle of nowhere on Wednesday, having a lapse of time of 24 hours in his life. When he arrives in his job, he becomes aware of the important events that he missed, and he is assigned with his partner Lisa Winders to minor works, not covering the important election between Hansen, of whom Hastings is a collaborator, and Gordon. On the next morning, Aaron wakes-up again in the same field but on Tuesday, and he is able to avoid the announced tragedies, disclosing a huge political conspiracy.</plot><plot>After breaking the news with the arrest of Thomas Hastings, the suspect of the abuse and murder of two children in a Monday morning, the asthmatic photojournalist Aaron Dougherty becomes the sensation in the ACN News Organization, being congratulated by the director Adele Ransom.
