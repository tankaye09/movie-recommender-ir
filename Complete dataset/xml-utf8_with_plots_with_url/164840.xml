<plot>This is a most perfect picture and is bound to amuse everybody. When the picture first appears on the screen, a dining room is seen, and a waiter enters with a number of dishes and prepares to set the table when they fall to the floor. A man and his wife with their guest now enter the room, and as they are about to sit down to the table their chairs change their positions as if by magic, and the three persons drop to the floor. The table is also seen to move and the chairs finally jump up on the table, when the parties seat themselves thereon, and the table falls over, and the three persons falling on top. Throughout the entire film there is life and action. It is not alone interesting, but laughable in the extreme, and young and old are highly amused. A very beautiful illusion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164840</url></doc>
