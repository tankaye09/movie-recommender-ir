<plot>After returning home from work on a usual day, Nader Azmy, a young journalist, gets accidentally locked outside his apartment. Wearing only a bath-towel around his waist, Nader tries to approach neighbors to seek help. After, knocking on several doors, meeting different people and facing unpleasant situations yet still unaided, Nader starts to realize that there is something common binding all these people's lives; something they are missing; something everyone is trying to reach and yet can't, including himself. Through a dramatic and contemplative climate, the film reveals a new meaning to the ordinary life of many to be deeply pensive and unwittingly illusive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079806</url></doc>
