<plot>In this remake of Gene Autry's 1942 "Call of the Canyon", Rex Allen, the newly-elected head of the cattleman's association, is driving the combined herds of the ranchers to the nearest railhead when he runs into trouble. The drive is stopped by Brock Stevens, whose father is a power in the meat-packing industry, and whose ownership of the railroad spur line enables him to deal ruthlessly with the local ranchers. Rex and the other ranchers are elated when Brock agrees to pay fair-market price for the cattle until they learn the exorbitant loading fees he charges will eat up their profits. The only alternative is to drive the herd to the main line railroad at Big Bow, but to do so means Brock will crack down on them for the $10,000 feed bill they owe his company. Rex starts to Tulsa to borrow the needed money, after ending a move by Hank, the lone dissenter among the ranchers and actually in league with the Stevens crowd. Brock sends his foreman, Webb, to stop Rex and his sidekick Jigg and when this fails, Brock contacts his father, Charles Stevens in Tulsa. Whens the elder Stevens learns that Rex is appealing to Kate Carney, owner of a rival packing company, he sets a plan in action to undermine Rex's appeal for a loan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239577</url></doc>
