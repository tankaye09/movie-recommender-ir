<plot>Many have heard of the famous Loop the Loop at Coney Island, but have never had an opportunity to see it. Here it is. For a time it will puzzle us, and cause us to wonder why the occupants of the cars do not fall out when the same is at the top of the Loop, and is practically upside down. This is a subject that always receives a fair share of applause.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341522</url></doc>
