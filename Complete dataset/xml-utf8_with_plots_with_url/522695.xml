<plot>Supermerle is Djane, a Techno-DJ in Berlin. She plays music at events of the independent scene in the dilapidated houses of East Berlin. Even when the music stops, its rhythm seems to go on uninterruptedly in Merle. The city of Berlin lends its character to her tunes and her awareness of life. This interaction is expressed in the techno- images of the film. What shy Supermerle does not say in words she says with her hands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522695</url></doc>
