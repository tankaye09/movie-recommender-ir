<plot>The story of Coral Fusion Latina; Canada's first and only Latin American choir. Its members are amateur singers and all are immigrants to Canada, representing countries such as Brazil, Columbia, Spain, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Argentina. The documentary follows the progress of the choir shortly after its inception, and culminates in their debut concert in front of a Vancouver audience one year later. Rehearsals, for the members of Fusion Latina, provide an opportunity to socialize with fellow Latinos and let loose in a way not afforded in their daily lives within Canada's relatively reserved Anglo-Saxon society. Their rambunctious behaviour, however, tend to turn rehearsals into free-for-all's, which frustrates their Argentinean born-Canadian raised conductor no end as she endeavors to prepare them for their debut.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264947</url></doc>
