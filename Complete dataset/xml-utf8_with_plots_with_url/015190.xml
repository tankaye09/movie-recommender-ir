<plot>"This is a street scene. The rain has just ceased, and passers-by are lowering their umbrellas. A well-dressed young man meets a pretty girl beneath an awning over a shop door. While they are standing there, the shopkeeper lowers the awning, which has accumulated a lot of water, and the two are thoroughly drenched. This picture has made a big hit."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015190</url></doc>
