<plot>What are the world's best swimmers doing when they're not training to make an Olympic team? Many of them are going to college and representing an American university, where the groundwork is laid for the fastest swimming in the world. At the University of Arizona, a team of world-class swimmers has captured every prize possible: world records, individual national championships and Olympic medals. Yet one accomplishment eludes them: the team title at the Division I NCAA National Championships. Between the Water and Wood chronicles a season in the life of these elite level athletes who vow to bring their coaches a team ring. A compelling close-up of the final frontier of amateur sports, the film tells the story of five college students and their teammates who train as hard as they compete. In this touching documentary, the athletes - along with their families and coaches - shape a film with heart and soul as well as strength and speed. Their success will depend on many pieces of the rigorous process: recruiting, dry land training, intense water drills and making the time standards to qualify for the final competition. As the season unfolds, the viewer takes on the athletes' passion for a winning finale. The emotional outcome of heartbreak and triumph surpasses everyone's expectations, including the filmmakers. Between the Water and the Wood profiles an exploding international sport and delivers an appealing punch that will leave film lovers of all ages delighted and satisfied.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067195</url></doc>
