<plot>When Seymour the stork delivers a baby to the wrong family yet again, he finds himself on the verge of being fired from the Baby Factory by his boss, Rhino, and his ever scheming side-kick stork, Stanley. In an effort to save his career and avoid ending up as a disgraced Fed-Ups truck driver, Seymour is given one last chance to deliver a baby to the correct family, only to discover the parents-to-be are unfit for a child. Torn between his job at stake and his good conscious, Seymour simply cannot leave the baby there. He instead drops Baby Seal off to loving lioness, Lark, and her stubborn yet proud husband, Louie. All was fine, until Stanley, hungry to kick Rhino out and become head honcho of the Baby Factory, discovers Seymour's intentional mistake, and makes it his mission to destroy him. Desperate to keep Lark, Louie, and the Baby Seal a family- Seymour, his loyal stork partner, Sonja, and his friends the Gorilla family, must fight against the evil Stanley and his cohort of Possums before they destroy the Baby Factory and take it over forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516696</url></doc>
