<plot>Roger, a young man conflicted by the death of his friend, tries to outrace his inner demons by fantasizing himself as an Olympic swimmer. Roger's only hope is his psychologist Dr. Shealds, who slowly crumbles beneath the tremendous guilt he feels about the accidental drowning of his daughter. The two stories intertwine when, in a fit of mania, Roger destroys the psychologist's office and with it, the last memento Shealds has of his daughter. Shealds' mind dissolves in grief and he throws Roger out setting off a chain reaction of death and despair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525521</url></doc>
