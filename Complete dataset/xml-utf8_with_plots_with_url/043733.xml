<plot>Imagination, memories, and fiction combine in this documentary film about the life and world of renowned Israeli writer Aharon Appelfeld. The film joins the author on his daily pilgrimages to the Anna Ticho House in Jerusalem, a caf√© he uses as a place to write and meet with friends and colleagues. At "his" table, Appelfeld remembers, becomes inspired, and re-creates his childhood world, which was shattered by the Holocaust. Appelfeld's dramatic personal story is enriched by excerpts from his writings in this attempt to understand the mysteries of the creative process. Capturing Appelfeld's creative writing process reveals the depths of the collective Israeli psyche and gives the viewer a better understanding of where Israelis are coming from and what motivates them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043733</url></doc>
