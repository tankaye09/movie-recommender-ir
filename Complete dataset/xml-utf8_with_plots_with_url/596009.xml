<plot>Set in late 18th century England, depicts the life of nonconformist preacher and poet John Fawcett. Compelled by a desire to minister, young John is called to pastor a flock of farmers and shepherds in the uncivilized village of Wainsgate, England. John and his family quickly learn that the task he so eagerly anticipated is wrought with hardship. Faced with the opportunity to pastor an influential church in London, John must choose between a life of prominence, and the family of believers he has come to know and love. Containing dialog from actual memoirs of the late John Fawcett, the period-drama recounts the story of how he was inspired to write the words of the timeless hymn, "Blest be the Tie that Binds."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596009</url></doc>
