<plot>Kashinath (Ajay Devgan) and Imli (Manisha Koirala) are childhood sweethearts and everyone expects them to marry. Then comes rich, wealthy, and sickly Anjali Chopra (Karishma Kapoor) into Kashinath's life, and then everything changes. Anjali gives up on her sickiliness and becomes bold, thanks to Kashinath's care. Anjali falls in love with Kashinath, and boldly tells her dad, Manmohan Chopra (Dalip Tahil), that she will only marry Kashinath. But her dad wants her to wed Ajit (Avinash Wadhawan). Imli reveals her secret that she has heart disease, and if not treated, she will die. Kashinath, unaware of Anlali's affections must find the money to save his true love.
