<plot>Tom wakes up, and realises he's had a one-night-stand. As his drink-addled mind feeds him dangerous memories, his increasing anxiety fuels a paranoid imagination, until he learns a valuable lesson. This is a fast paced roller-coaster ride through the mind of a man increasingly aware of the possible implications of his infidelity, as he makes his way home the morning after the night before. First, he imagines admitting everything to his wife; it doesn't play out well. So, he tries running through an excuse: fine. Then he discovers his wedding ring is missing and remembers why; it's been swallowed. And he's in big trouble.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?537414</url></doc>
