<plot>One Strong Arm is an inspiring and funny portrait of an extraordinary young man. When he was eighteen months old, Cody Wagner was diagnosed with a brain tumor. During surgery to remove it, he suffered a series of strokes that paralyzed one side of his brain and body. At the time, the doctors predicted he would never recover. They were wrong. Sixteen years later, with the support of his friends and family, Cody finds the one sport that will make him whole again...arm-wrestling.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412668</url></doc>
