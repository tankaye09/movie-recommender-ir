<plot>Based on the mid-eighteenth century novel, The Dream of Red Mansions is a story that tells about the love between Pao Yu and Tai Yu. It also exposes the evils of the feudal system and the crimes of the feudal ruling class through the prosperity and decline of the four notable families of Chia, Shich, Wang, and Hsueh. Tai Yu is a beautiful girl who occasionally gets ill. Her cousin Pao Yu falls for her over the years and puts up with Tai Yu's sensitivity and fragile health. They live in the Grand View Garden of their village along with their cousins and Pao Yu's Siblings, where they go to school and spend quality time. The story gives praise to the revolts of the slaves in the Grand View Garden and reflects the social contradictions and early democratic thinking of their time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554317</url></doc>
