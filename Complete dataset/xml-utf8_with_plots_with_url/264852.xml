<plot>Haunted by a rapist she could never identify, Jennifer struggles to find a way to escape the memory and nightmares of the night she was raped. Hesitant and unsure of herself, Jennifer joins a self defense class where she learns more than she could ever imagine. When Jennifer is set to practice her self defense skills with a trainer she freezes and begins to let the memory of the rapist seep into her head and before she realizes it she has sunken back into the night that she was raped. With the trainer and rapist becoming one in the same Jennifer is confronted with the 'rapist' she was unable to fight off before.
