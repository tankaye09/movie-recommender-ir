<plot>"This picture shows President Faure accompanied by a large party of friends, leaving the shooting box, on their way to the covers where they indulge in pheasant shooting shown in our picture No. 294E [PRESIDENT FAURE SHOOTING PHEASANTS]. The photography of these pictures is very fine; an excellent portrait of the various members of the party is given."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570087</url></doc>
