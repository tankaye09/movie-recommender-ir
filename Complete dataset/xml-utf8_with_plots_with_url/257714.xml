<plot>Angelo, a young teacher of Anthropology, has returned to Salento after a six-year absence. His homecoming, however, has a few surprises in store. Angelo must again face his past and a homeland which reveals itself to be ambiguous and hostile. The places that were, until only a few years previously, familiar and recognizable, now manipulate him, attracting him and repulsing him, sending him mysterious messages that Angelo struggles to comprehend. The protagonist is catapulted almost blindly into a world somewhere between dream and reality. The sting of a scorpion (the tarantula), metaphorically marks the beginning of his journey: deep in the ancient culture of a Salento full of emotion, in its legends, superstitions, pagan rituals that Angelo relives, being bewitched by the notes of tarantula; In the arc of a couple of months, Angelo sees the crumbling of his emotions. His one-time friend, Tot√≤, has become a small-time crook who pushes his young daughter Giada into a life of prostitution. The women he comes into contact with force him to confront an uncomfortable past. His meeting with Shaula, a sensual, liberal woman, helps release him from an oppressive situation. Having become so detached from a world of poison, but not so much from himself, Angelo has no choice but to assert himself and maintain his own integrity in an extreme act of liberation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?257714</url></doc>
