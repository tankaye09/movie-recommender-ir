<plot>A talented but disenchanted high school student seeking more advanced instruction sneaks inside the ivy covered gates of nearby Brown University.

His passion for learning affects and amazes all those around him, but soon his house of cards begins to crumble and the penalties could do more than jeopardize just his academic future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446733</url></doc>
