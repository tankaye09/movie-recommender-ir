<plot>Marly, a documentary filmmaker, decides to call the world's bluff. If women are seen as reflections of the men in their lives--who is she? What better way to find out than to grill her ex-boyfriends and collect her data on film...Her first interview is with Jim (Coleman McClary), a high school "boyfriend" who doesn't really remember her. As predicted by Mark, her lippy cameraman, the first interview is a disaster. They plow ahead to the next boyfriend, Steve, who likes his pants tight and his women bossy. It's a volatile combination. Next up is Bob-an actor engaged in a dramatic monologue-however, once the monologue is over, only a self-conscious, insecure shell remains. Marley inadvertently eats him alive. The interviews continue . . . while she and Mark battle themselves, each other, and a growing connection between them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?237452</url></doc>
