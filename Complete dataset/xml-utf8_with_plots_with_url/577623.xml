<plot>This Movietone Special (in CimemaScope) shows famed-stunt pilot Paul Mantz exhibiting some of his most well-known stunts such as flying through hangars. Since most of his most daring stunts were in B&amp;W films and not in CinemaScope, most of the footage is Mantz duplicating stunts from the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577623</url></doc>
