<plot>Prakash (Madan Puri) and Ranjit (Anwar Hussain) are criminals engaged in various nefarious activities. One day they are arrested in Ranjit's home, leaving behind Ranjit's wife, Shanti (Sulochana) and child, Dev. Shanti relocates to a friend's (Mumtaz Begum), who also has a child by the name of Salim. Years past, Dev (Rishi Kapoor) and Salim (Paintal) grow up and play a band for weddings and receptions. One day they witness the two hoodlums, Prakash and Ranjit, along with their goon (Viju Khote), killing a man in a graveyard. Dev and Salim flee. But the hoodlums know what they look like and so Dev and Salim change into women's clothing and join a band of girls going to Srinagar. Amongst the girls' is beautiful Reetu (Neetu Singh), who has run away from her cruel aunt (Lalita Kumari), who wanted her to marry 50 year old Prakash in exchange of a suitcase full of money. Dev falls in love with Reetu, but is unable to openly show his affection for her because of his disguise as Devi. Reetu confides in Devi that she would prefer to fall in love with a rich, young, and handsome man. So Dev masquerades as a rich man, Esso. In the meantime the hoodlums are holding vigil over the residence of Shanti and Salim's mom's, and eventually they find out the whereabouts of Dev and Salim, and they will leave no stone unturned to kill them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453607</url></doc>
