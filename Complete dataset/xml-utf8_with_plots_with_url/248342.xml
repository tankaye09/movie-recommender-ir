<plot>This is a very telling comic film illustrating a familiar subject. The "queen of the kitchen" is visited in rapid succession by the butcher, baker, the post man and the ubiquitous ice man, all of whom make love to her. The butcher and the baker have poor success, the post man, however, finds great favor until the entrance of his rival, whereupon he hides behind the screen. The ice man then proceeds to make violent love to the beauty which the man of letters, from his hiding place, does not appreciate. In his excitement he falls down, bringing the screen with him and revealing his presence, when the ice man gives him a sound pummeling, and finally has the field and the lady all to himself. Very popular wherever shown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248342</url></doc>
