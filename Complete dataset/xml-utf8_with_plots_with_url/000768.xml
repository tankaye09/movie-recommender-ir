<plot>It is a unusual documentary that mixes the music of famous opera composer Giuseppe Verdi with places, faces and voices from Piacenza, a nice place in the north of Italy where Verdi lived and composed his music. Probably it could have been more interesting if the musical part was not so preminent...recommended for Verdi's fans</plot><plot>It is a unusual documentary that mixes the music of famous opera composer Giuseppe Verdi with places, faces and voices from Piacenza, a nice place in the north of Italy where Verdi lived and composed his music.
