<plot>'Victoria' is the story of a girl, Victoria, who lives through pergatory and is subjected to extreme bullying until she decides to strike back at her oppressors. The bullies follow her into school, her place of work, her walks from home, her dreams, and eventually her mind. As Victoria's paranoid delusions increase, the line between fantasy and reality become progressively more blurry. She is tortured by the constant relentlessness of their presence and she doesn't see any light or any form of escape. Victoria is a victim or their prey until she becomes empowered by starting a new job at a Butchers and discovers that there are ways of stopping the cycle of life and other vicious cycles surrounding her. Dressed in her Butchers coat and gloves she cocoons her new prey and the now mad Victoria decides that she doesn't want to hear their laughter anymore. The final scene is the climax of her eventual downhill spiral into darkness and madness, rather than towards the light, and the sadness of the darkness of the final moments is a portrayal of the reality of being pushed over the edge when she cuts the bullies out of her life (literally).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?639575</url></doc>
