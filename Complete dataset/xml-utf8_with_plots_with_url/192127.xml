<plot>Felix starts to worry that, because he's a black cat, he may be a jinx. In fact, he worries about that so much that he becomes morose, doesn't eat and begins to get thin and scrawny. He realizes that it's not good for his health and that in order to get better, he has to learn how to laugh so he'll eat more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192127</url></doc>
