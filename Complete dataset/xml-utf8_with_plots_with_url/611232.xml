<plot>In this Asian, low budget "March of the Wooden Soldiers" knock off, 9 year-old Ken Loh is a happy boy eventually spends too much time with playing with his toys and his pug dog, Sagwa(Apple) and help out his father and mother. During the Christmas Eve blizzard, Ken and his dog Sagwa travels to Toyland in Wizard of Oz-like fashion and arrives just in time for a wedding. Young Bo Peep, whom strangely wears a frilly mini-skirt type outfit, is about to marry mean, old Barnaby Barnacle, despite the fact that she loves Jack, the giant slayer. Ken tries to stop this terrible wedding and, together with his new friends from various mother goose tales and folk tales, discovers that Barnaby wants to take over Toyland. Ken, Bo-Peep, Jack, Merlin, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn ask the Toymaster and Santa Claus for help, but it seems like Santa has problems of his own. Barnaby sent out a bunch of hobgoblins to sabotage Santa's workshop and capture and bully around his elves and wants Ken and his friends to save the workshop and toyland.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611232</url></doc>
