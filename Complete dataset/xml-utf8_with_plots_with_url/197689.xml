<plot>Rii is on a perilous adventure in a surreal world of nightmares. A jet-black creature with merciless tendrils emerges from an ornate hourglass, pursuing her relentlessly down halls to unknown places. Only the appearance of the Golden Umbrella reveals her path to escape - a path that will one day lead her away from the savage beast and into the arms of her eternal love. From her bedside, Rii's sister assures her that the next chapter is only a day away. Together they create a sweeping adventure, with each day bringing with it danger, mystery, beauty, and hope. In her final wish, Rii takes her life and the story into her own hands, at last delivering herself and her love into the safe embrace of the Golden Umbrella - it is her greatest desire to write her own ending, and she does.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197689</url></doc>
