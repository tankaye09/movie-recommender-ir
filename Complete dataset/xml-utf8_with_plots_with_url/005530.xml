<plot>Jonathan LaFever's Annual Barnyard Car Race has become a Bovina Center, NY (pop. 664) tradition, drawing an audience of hundreds on one Saturday every August. But the townspeople have come to see more than just an offbeat race--they're eager to witness the moment when one of the 25 competitors finally dethrones Jonathan, the race's four-time undefeated champion.
