<plot>With the 2008 U.S. presidential election fast approaching, you need to see How Ohio Pulled It Off, a provocative new documentary that offers sobering evidence of election fraud in the United States, and highlights the potential for future abuses. On election night 2004, across the United States and the world, citizens were glued to their televisions, waiting to discover who would win the greatest power position on the planet. The presidential decision came down to one state among fifty: Ohio. What really happened in Ohio, on that fateful day in November? What will happen on the same day in November 2008? How Ohio Pulled It Off chronicles the theft of the presidency, and the public outcry that followed. Infuriated by official malfeasance and partisan indifference, citizens took swift action. Multitudes protested in the streets, the voting rights movement was revitalized, and the powers-that-be were forced to pay attention. The story continues today, casting a shadow of uncertainty on the 2008 election and beyond.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248212</url></doc>
