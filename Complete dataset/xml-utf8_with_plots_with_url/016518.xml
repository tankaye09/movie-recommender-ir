<plot>A young missionary, plagued by dreams of an abused alternate life, searches for meaning in a dying world, and discovers that he has an unusual effect on all those he meets. But when tragedy strikes unexpectedly, he realizes that before he can save others, he must first find a way to save himself. A desperate prostitute may hold the answer, but the end is closer than he knows. Produced for less than $1000, this hour-long drama constructs a non-linear puzzle for the viewer that is not complete until the final, shocking moment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016518</url></doc>
