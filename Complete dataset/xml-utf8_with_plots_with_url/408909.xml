<plot>Sam Marks graduated from a fine arts academy with recognition for his craft. Delusions of grandeur quickly fade away as he realizes that he is stuck living in a small apartment, working tedious day jobs and struggling to find out if its worth his time to continue painting. Confused as to why while in school his work was held in high regard, yet now he is barely able make ends meet. Soon he becomes disenchanted with his work, thinking that with every stroke of his brush he is perpetuating his frustration. While working on his most recent piece, he grows angrier and lets his frustration out on his work. Having decided in his own mind that he is finished with being a struggling artist, he literally throws his paint down the drain. As if conjured by his weakened spirit, a past mentor, Mr. Stevens, visits him. With plans of finishing their prolonged game of chess, the mentor sees that his former pupil is in trouble and tries to get Sam out of his funk.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408909</url></doc>
