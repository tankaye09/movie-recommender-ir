<plot>Like the Wright brothers' historic flight a century ago, Burt Rutan's SpaceShipOne ushers in a new era of civilian aviation, lifting us right off the planet and straight into space! Mojave Magic: A Turtle's Eye View of SpaceShipOne takes you up close and personal to witness the first privately funded space flight and the two flights that won the $10 million Ansari X Prize - complete with champagne celebration and comments by the key players. Join Mike Melvill, the world's first private astronaut, as he climbs aboard SpaceShipOne in the predawn desert chill. Experience the remote and exotic Mojave Airport, including a late night dance party attended by rocket fans from around the world. And, of course, enjoy the numerous takeoffs, launches, landings and flybys of all the fabulous aircraft involved in this amazing event. Mojave Magic has it all. This piece of history is a "must have" for everyone's collection.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374502</url></doc>
