<plot>Depicts in wonderful photography Napoleon's campaign against Russia and his disastrous defeat at Moscow, in which the soldiers of the Czar hovered beyond reach of the French army, destroying by fire cities and provisions until the great Napoleon was compelled to retreat, with his soldiers decimated at every step by privation and the fierce guerilla sorties of the Russians. The thrilling battle and the burning of Moscow are shown with startling reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?258415</url></doc>
