<plot>Latinos defy many of our ideas about what an ethnic group is and how it behaves. Latinos '08, a one-hour PBS documentary, examines these new Americans through the prism of the 2008 presidential election. Latinos don't fit this country's black/white racial binary, and they are less cohesive than many other voting blocs. How are Obama and McCain trying to attract these unpredictable voters? And how is the immigration debate complicating their efforts? Is the Latino bloc already merging with the general electorate, as European ethnic blocs did before them? Or is globalism, not assimilation, the new model? In investigating such questions, Latinos '08 sheds light on an important part of our American future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321148</url></doc>
