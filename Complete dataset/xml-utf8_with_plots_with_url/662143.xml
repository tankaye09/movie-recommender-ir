<plot>A long-haired hippy in a tie-dyed shirt sits on a couch in front of a coffee table where several packets of LSD lie. He examines them: one is from Iowa, one from Minnesota, and one from the West Coast. That's the one he drops. He flips TV channels, finds "It's a Wonderful Life," and settles in to watch his favorite movie. As his acid trip begins, he starts talking like Jimmy Stewart, imagining himself as George Bailey. By the time the TV movie ends and Clarence gets his wings, our tripping hippie has taken his own flight of fancy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662143</url></doc>
