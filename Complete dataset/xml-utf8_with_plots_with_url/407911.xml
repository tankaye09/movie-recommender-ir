<plot>Malory Stone, blood-hound investigative reporter, is in exile. Her articles have led to the indictment of a mob boss and there is a price on her head, so her editor ships her to England for her, and his, health. She is miserable covering the social calendar section until William Betancourt, an energetic philanthopist, flings her into the tribal and fast-paced world of the English Football Leagues where his team, the Wanderers, is having a record setting season. Malory is swept up by the championship run and William's charm, but her instincts sense something is wrong. The games are being fixed and Malory sets out to expose the racketeers before they can harm the team's prospects and William's good name.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407911</url></doc>
