<plot>"Oaxaca Day of the Dead" is a collection of eight documentary short films. Shot during Day of the Dead in the Central Valley of the State of Oaxaca in the South of Mexico. From an objective point view each short film shows the importance of the event to the people that appear on camera. After seeing all of them, it is very clear that each town has it's own unique way of honoring and celebrating the dead. Every individual is shaped by elements from our life on earth, for example, like their spending capacity. While some have little money available their participation is limited to set a modest offering altar at home, others in a better financial situation throw big parties and hire musicians to perform at the cemetery for their deceased family members. Regardless of their economic differences, the reality is, that in essence their motivation to honor their ancestors is the same. The short films are titled after the towns' names, Tlacolula, Oaxaca City - Municipal Cemetery, Reyes Etla, San Juan Teitipac, Xoxocotlan, Oaxaca City - Del Bajio Parade, San Felipe del Agua and San Agustin Etla.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406263</url></doc>
