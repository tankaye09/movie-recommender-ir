<plot>June 2, 2006, Michael Pritchard visited with students from Madrone High School to talk to the students about topics such as drug abuse, bullying, self esteem, peer pressure and more. Michael is a nationally acclaimed motivational speaker who blends his stand-up comedy background with real world experience as a probation officer in a way that grabs the attention and hits home on many levels with his audience. At the end of the day Michael asked each student to write him a letter about what they learned or got from the experience. It is some of these letters, combined with the actual footage from his lecture that have been crafted into 'Dear Michael,' Letters from the heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133724</url></doc>
