<plot>After a deranged scientist releases a group of experimental creatures and commits suicide, a security guard loses his grip on reality. Atop unexplained hallucinations of a strange child and disembodied voices, the guard is faced with the challenge of deciphering his illusions from a dangerous reality. Consequently, he is quickly swept into a terrifying puzzle that will uncover his past, and shake the foundations of his future. The only other slight problem is that his wife has dropped off his son in the midst of this horrific nightmare.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114503</url></doc>
