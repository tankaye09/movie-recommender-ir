<plot>"This view, taken in the swimming pool at the Riverside Recreation Grounds near Boston, is full of action, and very interesting. In the foreground is seen a jousting match between two men standing in canoes. In the background are a large number of bathers enjoying themselves on water slides, spring boards, and diving towers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044198</url></doc>
