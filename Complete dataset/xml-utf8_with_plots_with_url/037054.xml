<plot>Over half a century after making his first appearance at the home of British Film, Pinewood Studios, Sir Donald Sinden CBE returned for one night only to recall his years starring for the Rank Organisation and reminiscing about his long and illustrious career in show business. Filmed in the presence of fellow celebrities including Elaine Stritch, Frank Thornton and June Whitfield, Sir Donald vividly remembered the exciting times working opposite fellow acting legends such as Sir Dirk Bogarde and Kenneth More. In his own inimitable style, Sir Donald had the invited audience in hysterics as he let slip exactly what happened when Marilyn Monroe came knocking on his dressing room door, reveals which acting great crashed the ship in The Cruel Sea and how bad Clark Gable was at sharing cigarettes!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037054</url></doc>
