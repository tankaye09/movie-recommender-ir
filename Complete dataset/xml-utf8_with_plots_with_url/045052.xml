<plot>Though friends since early childhood, Jun and Kyo have followed different paths: Jun has become an earnest student and star athlete, while Kyo has become a punk-wannabe. One day, after passing by a strange man, Jun suddenly collapses while playing Rugby and dies. The shock of this convinces Kyo to turn his life around and start improving himself. Things start looking up for Kyo until one day he encounters the strange man again. Kyo realizes that the man has something to do with Jun's death, and that he will never be able to get on with his life until he discovers what really happened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045052</url></doc>
