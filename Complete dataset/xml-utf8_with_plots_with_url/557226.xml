<plot>The Female Face of Aids: Crisis in Malawi shines a light on the stigma and discrimination suffered by women living with HIV/AIDS in Malawi. The film follows the Leitner Center for International Law and Justice at Fordham Law School during the final weeks of a year-long study on how HIV/AIDS impacts Malawian women who comprise 58 % of those infected there. Eight students and four faculty members traveled to Malawi in 2007 interviewing a broad spectrum of people from the country to understand how these conditions persist. Learn about the issues these women confront such as economic dependency, physical and sexual abuse, commercial sex work and traditional male dominance as the students seek to find practical solutions for government officials, health workers and regular citizens to improve their lives and insure the nation's future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557226</url></doc>
