<plot>Dramatisation of one of the most infamous UK football scandals in the history of the game. In the early 1960s an ex-footballer, Jimmy Gauld, was able to bribe a large number of strikers and goalkeepers from football clubs all over the country to illegally throw matches and thus clean up at the bookies on these fixed matches. The scandal was eventually brought to light when football hating investigative journalist, Mike Gabbett, was assigned the story by his editor. Even though he had no idea where to start, Gabbett tenaciously continued to follow the story until he exposed top football star Tony Kay and his corrupt friends, which made headline news. The breaking of this story eventually led to Tony Kay and friends being sentenced to four months in prison and Jimmy Gauld as 'Mr. Fix It' receiving four years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558210</url></doc>
