<plot>After the death of his wife in a fire, Nicholas Turner is lost. Pressure mounts as Nicholas tries to sort out the meaning of what happened, while his incompetent supervisor pushes him to return to work as soon as possible. His sister, Jennifer, cares for him deeply - but doesn't have any answers. Then, he encounters a mysterious 'messenger' named Andrew, who claims to have the answers Nicholas is looking for. When he discovers that there is more to Andrew than it first seems, and that even angels - and devils - have taken an interest in his 'unique case,' Nicholas faces an important choice - a choice that could lead to the peace he is looking for, or ruin his life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461487</url></doc>
