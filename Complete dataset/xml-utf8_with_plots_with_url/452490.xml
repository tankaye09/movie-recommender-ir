<plot>A new counselor at an all-girls school in Japan finds that her new workplace is a disaster area: not only are the students suffering through bullying, sexual harrassment, drug addiction and other problems, the teachers are having nervous breakdowns and the administrators don't want to hear a word of it. Number one on her problem list is a vicious sadist who also happens to be the headmaster's daughter. Will she be able to help turn the school around, or will she be crushed and spat out like her predecessors?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452490</url></doc>
