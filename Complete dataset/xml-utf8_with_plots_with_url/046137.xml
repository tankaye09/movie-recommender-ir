<plot>The first of a series shows the Arrival of the Circus Train into the City of Philadelphia on Sunday, April 19th, 1902. Special preparations had previously been made to take pictures, and were successfully carried out in every detail. The train is seen to arrive in the yards of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the great locomotive puffing and snorting at the immense load she is drawing. Thousands of persons are stationed on the neighboring hills and bridges, and many gaze on the spectacle from the windows of their homes. It is an inspiring sight, and excitement reigns supreme.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046137</url></doc>
