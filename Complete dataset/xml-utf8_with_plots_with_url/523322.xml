<plot>At first glance, it seems almost normal. But look further, the villages are nearly empty, the flags are ripped, the produce rotting. This is the Gaza Strip, one month before the destruction of the Israeli villages. The 20 settlements are almost silent as they form the unlikely backdrop and the focus of a Canadian road trip. Both former Israelis, two old friends decide to take a farewell journey. What can they find there? Surreal: A Glance at a Land That No Longer Exists offers us a look past the news clips, the soldiers, and the concrete barricades, with a glance at lost possibilities and living hopes. The Gaza settlements are gone - this time and place exists only on film and in memories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523322</url></doc>
