<plot>Kat and Doug are an engaged couple embarking on their big day - moving day. Kat and Doug have decided to move in together, for the first time, before getting married and throughout their moving day we see how mis-communication, insecurities, and the basic differences between men and women can take a toll on a relationship. No sooner have Kat and Doug begun to unpack their things has Kat moved out - and into an apartment across the hall from Doug. Kat and Doug begin to realize that some of the things that pulled them apart are the things that will bring them back together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287735</url></doc>
