<plot>This is a film about an individual whose mad, desperate act got her committed to the Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario. She woke up for the first time in 20 years, shaking in newly-minted sobriety. She had forgotten that her mind, when it was not filled with the rage of alcohol, could see the world quite incisively. She discovered her own capacity for basic goodness; even under the most seemingly powerless conditions, she could be fearless and help others. Yet, once released she became lost again in the blur of her earlier life. She started drinking. Only this time, fate intervened, and by her good fortune she wound up at the Healing Lodge, the only federal prison in North America run by Native American Elders. They pointed out that healing was actually so simple: she had only to open her heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599348</url></doc>
