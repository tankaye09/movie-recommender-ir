<plot>In the life of an older man, routine helps him get through the day. Jozef is used to his daily routine: wake up, go to the factory, eat lunch. Every day looks the same. His life is measured by his perfunctory work, the rhythm of the day, and his regular habits. His wife Ruzena packs his lunch in his lunch box, gives him a clean shirt, and sends him off to work, just as she has done for many years. One day, however, when his wife suffers a stroke, his system collapses. Jozef, who is a factory worker, begins taking care of his wife full-time after she suffers a debilitating stroke that leaves her paralyzed. It's a reversal of roles before she used to take care of him. Now nothing will be the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573067</url></doc>
