<plot>Sam has a fight with his brother Matt over a dent in his car, and then has a fight with his girlfriend Claire over a party he doesn't want to go to. Later Sam gets a call from his estranged best friend Josh, who wants to impress the girl having the party by giving her a gift that was left at Sam's old house, which is now inhabited by a mysterious old couple. Sam sees a chance to win back Claire, and agrees to help Josh. Their mission is delayed, however, when they need to save Matt from the dangerously overprotective father of the girl he likes. Meanwhile, Sam's little sister reluctantly agrees to go canoeing with her distant father. All of them end up at the same party, but not the one they were expecting. And through all this, Sam's memories of Claire come to life around him, and hint that he might be trying to save the wrong relationship. Sam finally finds Claire, and his confrontation with her shocks everyone involved.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?497060</url></doc>
