<plot>In 1928, young Matthew Holmes' father attempted to travel across the North Pole by hot-air balloon. He ran into a badly frostbitten, dying man mumbling about a luxury ship named the Herculania. Interested in this, he decided to investigate...and disappeared. About thirty years later, in search of his father, Matthew has been separated from his party and is suffering in the cold climate and experiencing strange visions. As he is about to write his last words he discovers the ship that his father was searching for. Could this be the answer to the mystery of his father's death? What happened to the passengers on the ship?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377625</url></doc>
