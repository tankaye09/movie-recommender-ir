<plot>The sandwich man comes along and is stopped by a person who buys some sandwiches, throwing the hot sausage man on the ground and seating himself on his back, meanwhile earing all the time. Rising suddenly the hungry man runs away, the sandwich man chasing him. They race about the street for a while until a baker with his push cart comes along. The pursued jumps into the cart and pulls down the lid. The sandwich man returns with an officer but they cannot find their man, who is hidden in the bakery cart directly behind them. Exceedingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013779</url></doc>
