<plot>New York sports history is full of heroes and villains, big shots and bad guys. But something about the New York fans, the size of the city, the press, and the owners of our teams makes our heroes and villains bigger than life. All the greatest good guys and all the baddest bad guys would agree: This city is the best place to win, and the worst place to lose. Channel Thirteen/WNET's NEW YORK VOICES and the city's hometown paper, THE DAILY NEWS, have teamed up to chronicle the history of some of this town's most celebrated sports heroes and villains. BIG SHOTS AND BAD GUYS is narrated by Vincent Pastore, a.k.a. "Big Pussy" of HBO's THE SOPRANOS, and features famed DAILY NEWS journalists Pete Hamill and Vic Ziegel, along with the paper's legendary sports cartoonist, Bill Gallo.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069784</url></doc>
