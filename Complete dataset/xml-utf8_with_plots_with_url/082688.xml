<plot>Following on the hoofs of the hot movie "Seabiscuit" comes a television documentary about a horse and rider every bit as compelling. "Brentina: From Idaho to Athens, airing on major market stations across the country, tells the story of a teenage cancer victim whose idols are Dressage rider Debbie McDonald and her World Cup champion horse, Brentina. The bond between young rider Jennifer Serot and Debbie grows from a meeting arranged by the Make-a Wish Foundation, and begins when Brentina is on her way to the World Number one ranking in her sport. Debbie and Brentina will be Gold Medal favorites at the Athens Olympic Games in August. No American horse and rider has won the Olympic Gold in Dressage. The program documents Debbie's near-fatal fall from a jumping horse, and her climb to the top of the Dressage world. She wins the U.S. championship and leads the American team to a Silver Medal at the World Championships in Spain. Then, Brentina becomes part of an historic first--performing her Olympic Musical Freestyle program accompanied by a symphony orchestra under the stars in the mountains of Idaho.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082688</url></doc>
