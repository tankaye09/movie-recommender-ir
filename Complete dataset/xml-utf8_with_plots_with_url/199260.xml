<plot>A young man and woman sit down for a cup of coffee. They're in their twenties and have been friends since junior high school. She's been studying abroad for the last several years while he's been living in the basement of his parent's house in the same suburban community in which they grew up. When a lull in the conversation sets in, the young man decides it's the opportune time to reveal how he truly feels about her. His initial optimism that she may share his feelings slowly dissipates as the young woman attempts to let him down gently - though only after collecting all the compliments he has to offer. The young man compounds the problem by making a clumsy attempt to save face which contributes to their friendship being left in ruins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199260</url></doc>
