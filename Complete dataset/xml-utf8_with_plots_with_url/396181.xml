<plot>Set amidst the turmoil of a nation in transition and the global devastation of the Wall Street Crash, a get-rich-quick scheme involving land reclamation is inadvertently rumbled by three very different characters, two of whom share a past and who may or may not share a future. Their lives are pulled together as each of them tries to find an escape route, not only from themselves, but towards some kind of future. A potent cocktail of reckless romance, self-delusion and dawning self-awareness, Night in Bombay is a probing, sympathetic study of characters who repeatedly sell themselves short. Adapted from the novel by Pulitzer Prize winner, Louis Bromfield.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396181</url></doc>
