<plot>Edgar Britt was told by his trainer that he was too small to be a jockey but became one of the giants of international horse racing. After his first win in 1929, Britt, a movie buff, bought a film camera and recorded social and racing highlights in Australia, America, India and Britain. He rode for clever trainers, maharajahs, kings, queens, princesses and, unknowingly, gangsters. Along the way he encountered horses such as Phar Lap, Peter Pan, Winooka, Equipoise and Sayajirao and rode in the Melbourne Cup, Baltimore Handicap, Derby, St Leger, Oaks and Eclipse Stakes. He rode with Jim Pike, Darby Munro, Johnny Longden, Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott. He won the second-most English classic races for an Australian, has a national award and is in the racing Hall of Fame .</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083568</url></doc>
