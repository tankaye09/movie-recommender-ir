<plot>This short documentary follows the tour of Mallika Sarabhai and the Darpana Performing Group as they present 16 performances over 8 days across Kerala, India. 'Unheard Voices' (Unsuni) is a physical, musical theatre piece based on Harsh Mandar's book of the same name. It gives voice to five of India's millions of voiceless people through a series of monologues interspersed with appropriations of Hindi Film (Bollywood) songs. These are the marginalized, the unseen; these are stories of struggle and courage, and of victories. A street child, a leper, a victim of a riot, policy makers and the general public from across the nation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?630812</url></doc>
