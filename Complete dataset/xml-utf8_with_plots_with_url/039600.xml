<plot>Immediately following World War II, many commodities were scarce or hard to find. One of these commodities happened to be bubblegum. There were few resources and no real infrastructure in place to manufacture this confection...that is, until Andrew J. "Andy" Paris came along. Paris, the son of a successful Greek immigrant family, trekked from Detroit, Michigan to McAllen, Texas, where he set up an import business. In 1946, after securing latex from Mexican suppliers and sugar allotments from the US government, Paris started manufacturing bubblegum. Paris Bubblegum became an overnight success, as kids all across the world eagerly chewed it up. The famous Candy Bomber even dropped boxes of Paris Bubblegum during the Berlin Airlift. Andy Paris quickly rose to celebrity status. Dubbed "The Bubblegum King Of America" by Life Magazine, Paris appeared on various radio shows and newsreels, served as a bubblegum blowing consultant on Miracle On 34th Street, and befriended rising stars like Natalie Wood and Marilyn Monroe. By the time Andy Paris passed away in 1997, however, Paris Bubblegum had largely faded from memory, replaced by more recognizable names such as Bazooka and Wrigley's. How did this happen? What became of Andy Paris? This documentary will uncover the truth behind this untold chapter of American history...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039600</url></doc>
