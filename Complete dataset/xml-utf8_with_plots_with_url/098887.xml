<plot>Chain Reaction was hosted by Bill Cullen in 1980, but went off the air that same year. In 1986, it was revived as "The New Chain Reaction" in 1986 with host Geoff Edwards. It ran until 1991. Two teams of two players (two celebrities and two contestants) competed. Each team was composed of a giver and a guesser. The giver could give the letter in the next word of the chain to either his/her partner or opponent. A correct guess won the appropriate number of points for the round and retained control, while an incorrect guess passes control to the opponents. If you give a letter to your opponent and he/she doesn't get the word, you get to go again. In the first round, the first four words were worth 10 points each, while the last word was worth 20 points. In the second round, words were worth 20-30 points, and the third round 30-50 points. Also in later rounds, a cash word was in the chain worth $500 to the team who guessed it. The first team to reach 300 points won the game and advanced to the bonus round.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?098887</url></doc>
