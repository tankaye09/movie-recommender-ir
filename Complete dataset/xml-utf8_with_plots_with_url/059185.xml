<plot>Texans' passion for barbecue can best be described as love. Travel the Lone Star state for a humorous, yet accurate, look at how almost every aspect of life in Texas ties back to barbecue, from the identity of small towns to political success, and how the state and its people remain tied to the land. "Barbecue: A Texas Love Story" is an entertaining and humorous journey through the common fabric that weaves Texans together and makes them a never-ending object of fascination around the world. Narrated by Governor Ann Richards and featuring notables such as Dan Rather, Ray Benson, Kinky Friedman, Everclear lead singer Art Alexakis, Liz Carpenter, Chris Layton, the UT Student BBQ Club, plus a plethora of entertaining small town characters. Critics call "Barbecue: A Texas Love Story" an "effervescent documentary," worthy of "four stars." The filmmakers have been featured in dozens of television segments, including Food Network's "BBQ America with Bobby Flay," in "Men's Journal" magazine and on "Voice of America" radio around the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059185</url></doc>
