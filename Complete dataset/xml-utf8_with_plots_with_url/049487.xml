<plot>Actress Joan Crawford says goodnight to her children, and as she walks down the staircase addresses the audience stating that happy and healthy children are the greatest gift. She continues by saying that some mothers don't know that gift as their children are stricken with childhood cancer. She states that more than 200 child cancer patients are cared for every day at the Jimmy Fund Bldg. in Boston as clips show children playing and being treated at that facility. She tells the audience that they can "give the children their only hope" by donating to speed research for a cancer cure, and asks them to please give generously when the theatre ushers pass the hat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049487</url></doc>
