<plot>A crotchety streetsweeper keeps his street clear of dirt and dust, and of people and cars. He pushes them down a drain hole along with the trash. Then, a small child appeals to him when her ball rolls down her drain. He goes to work, fishing out all that he's shoved in, in search of the ball. But success with helping someone brings new problems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?322218</url></doc>
