<plot>A short film about two female childhood best friends in college who end up in very different places in adulthood, just because one was simply much more attractive. The film transgresses from their innocent meeting in childhood, and ultimately their conflict with each other was they enter the world of adultery, deceit and unfairness. The film looks to explore the concept of unfairness in life, inequality, and that how females grow up in a world where people judge them by their looks constantly and discriminatingly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062482</url></doc>
