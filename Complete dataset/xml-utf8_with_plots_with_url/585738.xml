<plot>Introverted high school student Byron Beauchamp worries his teachers because he likes to write short stories full of violence and gore. His councilor places him in a small special class for kids with a similar obsession. For the first time in his life, Byron finds a place where he is comfortable and quickly befriends the other misfits in the class. But the students soon lose their taste for gore fiction when they discover that their writing teacher, the ominous Mr. Stevens, possesses a supernatural power that makes the terrible stories they write come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585738</url></doc>
