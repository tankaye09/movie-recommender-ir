<plot>Jesus is here seen leading His disciples out to Mount Olivet, over against Bethany. There He stops. The disciples gather about Him. Every ear is listening, every eye on Him. Stretching forth His hands, He blesses those whom He has loved until the end, and while He is blessing them He suddenly disappears from the earth, and a cloud receives him out of their sight. As he disappears there stand beside them two men clothed in white and a loud voice cries "Amen. Come Lord Jesus." The entrance into Heaven, as shown in this subject, is remarkably interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425393</url></doc>
