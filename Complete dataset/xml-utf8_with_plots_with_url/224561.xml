<plot>There are two variations to play: "Record race" and the "Pogo competition". The Record race is for 2-4 players. Your aim is hunting 50 stars. You can choose one from 8 categories, whereof you get a question. If your answer is wrong, then the next player's turn. If your answer is right you get one star and the bonus question, one from another category, which you have chosen first. If you also answer the bonus question right, you get 3 further stars (4 stars total in this round). There are also jokers and sabotages. If you are sure at one question, you can play with a joker. If you're right, you get 6 stars, but if you're wrong, you get not a single star for this round. With sabotage you can catch two stars from everyone of your rival players, and only if you answer the following question right, if not you lose two stars on everyone of your rival players. The other variation is the Pogo competition that you can play alone. In the video you're climbing up a skyscraper. If you answer all 16 question right, you're on the top. But you have only three lives. If you lose all of them it's Game Over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224561</url></doc>
