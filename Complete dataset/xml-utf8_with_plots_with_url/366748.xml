<plot>"Mr. and Mrs. Hayseed have heard of this wonderful Professor, and come to his office. They awaken him from a trance, give him a fee and he hypnotizes them. The stunts they do while under his influence would make the Sphinx laugh for joy. Hayseed stands on his head, balances himself on a chair and takes off his clothes. Mrs. Hayseed also begins to disrobe, but she goes behind a screen. Her bare arms appears over the top, and she drops her clothes on the floor. It is a hair raising moment to guess what she's going to do next. The mystical appearances and lighting changes are managed with wonderful cleverness."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366748</url></doc>
