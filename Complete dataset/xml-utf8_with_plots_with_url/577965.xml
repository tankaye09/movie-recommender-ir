<plot>THE MUSIC OF AMERICA is a 6-hour HD public television series - accompanied by an extensive community and educational outreach campaign - that explores 400 years of American history through the perspective of its traditional music. Music and song is always tied to history, whether it is spirituals like Wade in the Water, a comfort and guide for escaping slaves before the Civil War, Yankee Doodle, sung by British soldiers to make fun of backwoods colonials fighting in the French-Indian Wars, or Los Golondrinas (The Swallows), a Mexican lament for people and places that have passed away. Every event in American history from colonial settlement and slavery through to 9/11 and the Iraq War has generated music that captures the reality and mood of its time. Music remains, as always, the most natural means of expression for the many different cultures and peoples that call America their home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577965</url></doc>
