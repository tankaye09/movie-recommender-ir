<plot>Bankshot and his friends are unique portraits of supernatural people. They are not normal in our world but fit right into their surroundings of East City. Growing up together, they all learned about themselves and their gifts at a young age. Bankshot; with his extremely long arms, Henri and Hawley; the nose brothers, and Emre; with his gigantic feet, all have come to understand themselves and work around or through their extraordinary circumstances. Years later they are still friends and decide now to stick together through love and death around them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164440</url></doc>
