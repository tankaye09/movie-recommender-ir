<plot>Here is seen a number of "Smokes" dancing for their favorite "watermelion," and they pound the floor with their cinderellas to beat the band. The luscious fruit is held by one of their number in plain view, and they finally stop dancing and engage in a tussle to see who can obtain the green fruit and devour it. Very lively and funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085313</url></doc>
