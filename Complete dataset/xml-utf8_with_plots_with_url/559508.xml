<plot>The Po'Boys - a band of four musicians - once had a hit single. Lots of radio play. Lots of paying gigs. But the record industry has passed them by^Ã…so has the general public whose musical tastes are continually changing. Their one song rarely - if ever - gets played on the radio. The paying gigs have all but dried up. Chuck - the songwriting leader of the Po'Boys, is discouraged and facing Writer's Block. His songs were once well thought of, but the music business clearly has changed. His songs are no longer seen as top grade. The other members of the Po-Boys - Peter, Joseph and Guy, are also facing a musician's mid-life crisis in a business that the age 30 is seen as over the hill. They feel they are at the end of their rope and know they need a big stash of cash to make their musical dreams a reality. They try different ways of scoring a big stash of cash. Drugs are out because they tried that before and some of the Po'Boys spent a little time behind bars. They try real deal get rich quick schemes but nothing pans out. Behind in rent, losing any real day jobs they have, they plan a Bank Robbery. They plan it the way Laurel and Hardy might plan a Bank Robbery, or perhaps the Marx Brothers. And the conclusion of the story is how the four attempt to pull off their Master plan, this well-thought-out Bank Robbery. In Mythology, this is a Trickster story. Things never seem to be the way they really are.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559508</url></doc>
