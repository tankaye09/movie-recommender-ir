<plot>The movie confronts the epidemic transmission of HIV/AIDS in the African American Community and many of the controversial issues surrounding its transmission including: prison relationships and the rapid transmission among inmates, bisexual black men that frequently practice unsafe sex with male and female partners, and the conflict between the homosexual lifestyle and the traditional values of the African American community. The story focuses on Jesse, a beautiful black woman, in love with an ex-con named Square, who portrays himself as an educated black man with a hip hop swagger, but is haunted by his double life as a bisexual, and who is burdened by a very "Dark Secret."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127311</url></doc>
