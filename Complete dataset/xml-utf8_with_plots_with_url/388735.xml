<plot>Naked People Wearing Clothes (NPWC) is an experimental comedy. MacGuffin: a term used to describe an inanimate object that motivates a story and characters but of whose specific details, contents and back-story is irrelevant. NPWC experiments with making the MacGuffin human and the results are as comical as they are poetic. You are a MacGuffin. We're all MacGuffins; haphazard threads in a web of jokes and a world of reticulated plots. We're all just naked people wearing clothes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?388735</url></doc>
