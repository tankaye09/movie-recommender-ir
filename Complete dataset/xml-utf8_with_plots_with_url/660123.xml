<plot>Women In Black offers a highly individual insight into the world of Muslim women around the world. Discover the Muslim makeover, sexy underwear and female Formula One racing driver in Dubai; clubbing, cosmetic surgery and surely the world's only Qur'an inspired TV sex therapist in Egypt. Just what is the latest headscarf style on the streets of Cairo? How do Yemeni women "smoke" their clothes and then get high on the local drug of choice? Why don't they invite men to their parties? Why are Muslim women in Holland into praying and rapping? Who is buying the new abaya couture in London? How do Muslim women in Britain adapt western high street clothes to suit their culture? Women In Black goes beneath the veil and shows how Muslim women really live around the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660123</url></doc>
