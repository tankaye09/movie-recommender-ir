<plot>Most people don't know their basic constitutional rights, and those who do usually waive them in the face of police intimidation. Worse, police rely on people's fear and ignorance of the law to trick them into waiving their rights, which often lands them in jail. That's why Flex Your Rights (FyR) -- a Washington, DC-based educational group -- created BUSTED: The Citizen's Guide to Surviving Police Encounters. This fun 45-minute educational DVD realistically depicts three common police scenarios -- traffic stop, street stop, and home entry. Narrator Ira Glasser, a former ACLU executive director, shows you how to avoid cops' "gotcha games" as they try to trick you into waiving your rights; how to be courteous but not intimidated by police tactics; and how phrases such as "I don't consent to any searches" can keep you out of jail. According to Steve Silverman, BUSTED's writer and FyR's executive director, "We made BUSTED for anyone who's afraid that their looks or lifestyle makes them a target for law enforcement. This includes skaters, smokers, rockers, and freedom-loving badasses of all sorts."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087671</url></doc>
