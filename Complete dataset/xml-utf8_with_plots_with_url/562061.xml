<plot>This is an exceedingly lively subject, and one likely to appeal to audiences in all parts of the country. It opens with a spectacular view of the New York city contingent on a dead gallop through the skyscraper district of lower Broadway on the way to the Pennsylvania Ferry. The scene then transfers to Baltimore, where a number of views of the great conflagration are shown. Among them is one showing the ruins covered with mountains of ice, and another shows a fire engine crushed by the falling walls. A close view of the firemen working in a perilous place amidst the smoke and flames on a roof makes a startling finish to this magnificent film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562061</url></doc>
