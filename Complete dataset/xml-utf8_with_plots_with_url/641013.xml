<plot>Vinsanity is a one person comedic performance starring Vince August. Vince is sent to a psychiatrist who is trying to help make Vince more mainstream and help him move away from his angry rants about his personal life, racial stereotypes, religion and society in general. Vince convinces the psychiatrist and a packed house at The World Famous Laugh Factory in New Yorks Time Square that deep down we are all mentally twisted. Vince performs over eighty minutes of outrageous material which is followed by some great post show interviews. Vinces on stage angry and edgy exterior even cracks from time to time as his audience sees the humor in his own form of madness or Vinsanity."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641013</url></doc>
