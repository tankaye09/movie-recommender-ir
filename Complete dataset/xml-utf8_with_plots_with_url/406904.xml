<plot>1921. In Russia a million children are without parents after six years of war, famine and disease. 300,000 of them have been orphaned by murderous anti Semitic attacks, their lives hanging by a thread. In South Africa, businessman Isaac Ochberg dreams a dream of saving some of these helpless and lost souls. Filmed in the original locations, together with unique archive footage and testimony from survivors, "Ochberg's Orphans" reveals this unknown story of heroism. Today, in a century dominated by wars, genocides and displaced peoples, Ochberg's legacy is a reminder that a small act can make a big difference.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406904</url></doc>
