<plot>"This view of another vessel of Sampson's squadron is taken as she lies coaling at her wharf in Key West. It is a busy scene; coal passers, stevedores, sailors and officers all seem imbued with a spirit of hustle. All except the men on the wharf, watching the work. One of them slowly gets up, stretches, yawns and walks off to the right scratching his head. The 'Marblehead' distinguished herself at the bombardment of San Juan, Porto Rico; which makes this view a valuable memento of the occasion. Outlines of vessel are clear, and the wharf-loungers in the foreground are full life-size."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119777</url></doc>
