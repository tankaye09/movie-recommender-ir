<plot>Hank Williams was banned from The Grand Ole Opry in August 1952 for drinking and missing shows. He was never reinstated before his untimely death on January 1, 1953. However, The Grand Ole Opry still uses Williams legacy as one of their main sources of promotion and even has a Hank Williams impersonator that greets folks at its door. Hank III, the hell-raising rock-a-billy grandson of SR, sets out to not just call out the Opry for the injustice to his grandfather, but to all the older Opry members as well in a "corporate" Nashville that he loves about as much as it loves him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459362</url></doc>
