<plot>Hawkwind are probably better known by their former members than their current ones, but nevertheless are an important rock group, at least in terms of the UK music scene. Formed in the late 1960's, Hawkwind achieved underground cult status along with counterparts Pink Floyd (led by then relatively stable Syd Barrett) and The Soft Machine. At various times, science fiction author Michael Moorcock (who is seen in this video), Lemmy (who went on to form Motorhead) and Ginger Baker of Cream stardom were all members of Hawkwind. From their early hits "Silver Machine" and "Urban Guerilla" to their modern day shows played at underground raves and rock festivals, Hawkwind continues to be a great creative force with a unique sound. The Chronicle of the Black Sword is one of their most ambitious record to date and a great listen, but to be truly enjoyed, the concert video should be obtained and viewed because with Hawkwind, as with early Pink Floyd, the visual spectacle was half the show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232148</url></doc>
