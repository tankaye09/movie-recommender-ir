<plot>immeritus -a -um act. [not deserving (punishment) , innocent]; pass., [undeserved]. Faced with the opportunity to judge his younger brother's killer, Marten must face the truth about his own identity before carrying out judgment. True to its meaning, Immeritus really is about what's undeserved. It's about the light and darkness that reside in every human being, and what happens when the truth brings that to light. Shot on location in west Los Angeles and the San Bernardino National Forest by a crew of 10 student filmmakers from various colleges and universities across the nation, Immeritus is an 8 minute short film that addresses a pressing national issue through filmic narrative.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260872</url></doc>
