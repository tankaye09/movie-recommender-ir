<plot>The Shoshones will never again give their great scalp dance unless they do so surreptitiously for Uncle Sam has forbidden any more of these fierce ceremonies that certainly stir up all the latent bad blood in the Red men. The picture was made at Cheyenne with the express permission of the Indian agent who stood near to call the ceremonies to a halt as soon as any excitement should manifest itself among the dancers. First, the Indians are seen marching to the dance ground. The squaws are sent scurrying to the teepees for they are not permitted around while the dance is going on. Then, the medicine men got around the tom-tom and started the music. The dancers began their gyrations. They did not like to have the photographer around and one -- the worst and most evil-looking of the band -- tried to shoot an arrow into the lens. Several times he made the trial to the consternation of our photographer and was then pulled away by the agent who stopped the dance and compelled the Indians to disperse. The dance is quite the most thrilling one ever photographed and was made at great risk not only to the machine but to the photographer as well for the Indians do not relish having their sacred rites caught on film. To get an audience worked up to the highest enthusiasm means that this wonderful film must be on the program.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494479</url></doc>
