<plot>Four friends, Abdul, Jason, Angela and Danielle enrolled at university with two things in mind: to pass their degree and have fun at the same time. They attended induction day to find out the first year exams weren't compulsory, so they did what any other student would do, take the year off. One morning in the canteen, they overhear the head of school talking to a lecturer about the curriculum being changed this year. All first year exams are now compulsory. With only 3 weeks to go and no notes, their only chance is to perform a heist. Jason devises a cunning plan to obtain the questions and answers. Abdul goes under cover as a Jamaican cleaner, Angela finds out when the admissions desk is only manned by one member of staff, Danielle disguises himself as a teacher on training day and Jason has the alarm code for the business school.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108445</url></doc>
