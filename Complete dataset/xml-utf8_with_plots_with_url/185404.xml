<plot>Myra prepares for and enters into an interview for a teaching post for a 'Creative Writing' course. As the interview progresses the panel discover that she has lied about her education on her resume. As Myra starts to dig a grave for herself, two of the panel quickly lose interest in the apparent chancer and bicker between themselves about literary theory. The third, however, pays particular attention to the text that Myra has written, as part of her application, and recognizes some genuine talent. He quizzes her about the text and her response partly answers the reason why she lied.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185404</url></doc>
