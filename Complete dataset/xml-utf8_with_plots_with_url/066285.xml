<plot>Ever since they were born on the same day, eleven-year-olds' Gemma and Alice have been the best of friends, sharing everything from birthday wishes and secrets to laughter and tears. Despite Gemma's boisterous nature being a sharp contrast to Alice's thoughtful, quieter manner, the two girls have been inseparable until disaster strikes...Alice's family are moving four hundred miles away to Scotland leaving the girls devastated. Gemma is particularly distraught when not only do plans to sabotage the move fail but Alice quickly settles into Scottish life and seems to have found herself a new best friend. However, her friend Biscuits and her grandfather and brother rally around to help her adjust. 'Best Friends' is based on the novel by Jacqueline Wilson, one of the most popular British children's authors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066285</url></doc>
