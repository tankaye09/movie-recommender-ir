<plot>Ever wonder how "real" the attention-getting antics of today's celebrities are? "Rex" explores the world of Hollywood's purposefully planned and manufactured controversies through the eyes of actor Simon Rex, as he persistently and desperately attempts to revive his flailing career. When Simon was hired as a VJ on MTV, he was on his way... so he thought. But he was a small fish in a small pond. That's when he was introduced to a secret world of very specialized public relations professionals called "Controversy Consultants." Their job: to conceive, plan and execute scandals that would catapult a client into the public eye...at least for a while.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?462378</url></doc>
