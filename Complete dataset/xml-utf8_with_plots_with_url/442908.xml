<plot>Celebrity chef Ralph Pagano undergoes the challenge of a lifetime when he's dropped off in far-flung locations throughout the world and has 72 hours to discover the country's culinary cuisine, picture postcard locations and local secrets before the time arrives for him to depart back home. With a limited amount of money and resources-Ralph will have to use his cooking ingenuity and mojo to make sure he gets home on time! It's a mix of skill, survival and curiosity in mojoHD's latest original series: Pressure Cook. Pressure Cook is "No Reservations" meets "The Amazing Race" as each half hour episode surprises us with a new and exotic place. Ralph's journey begins with a tour and overview of the location - delving into the rich cultural and culinary history. Upon arrival he's given some basic information about the country and then it's time to get cooking - literally.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442908</url></doc>
