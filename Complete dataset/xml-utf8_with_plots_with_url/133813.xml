<plot>Death Awaits is a short film about a young man who dreams of Death one night. Then, on his way to work the next morning he sees Death following him. Unnerved, he tries to evade the dark figure, but is eventually forced to confront his fears "face to face." In a flash of panic and fury, the young man attacks the physical appearance of Death and pounds him to the ground, kicking him until motionless. Seemingly, he has beat death, but can he beat fate?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133813</url></doc>
