<plot>Showing, as it does, a most wonderful train under most wonderful circumstances. It shows the fine train of the C. M. &amp; St. P. at Morton Grove, traveling at the rate of 78 miles per hour; you see it in the distance when suddenly, with a swish and swirl, it is past; then you see a team crossing the track, being lead by teamsters, when -- look out -- here comes another train on the next track, going in the opposite direction; will it hit the wagon? No, it is a very narrow escape. Send for this, it is great.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433585</url></doc>
