<plot>This is a dandy, but is only one of the many performances of Mr. Walter Stanton, a natural born comedian. You see a little Bantam Rooster pitted against a supposed bird fully as large as an ordinary man. They fight all around a pit, but the little fellow is victorious, and deals his huge adversary a solar plexus blow without seeming difficulty. The ludicrous part of this picture is the difference in the sizes of the birds. It is bound to get a good laugh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087078</url></doc>
