<plot>Upon first glance, Teresa Avery has it all. She's beautiful and about to marry the perfect man and have the most picture perfect life. But, beneath all of the perfection, Teresa has had to make many difficult decisions about love, life and family. Many of these decisions are weighing on her heart and mind and threaten to crack that mirror of perfection that she has fought so hard to build for herself.

If you were, would you have made the same choices?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104281</url></doc>
