<plot>It all started when young Viola Tarakanova, your typical private English teacher, picked up a strange, half naked girl off the street, who was seemingly suffering from amnesia. Wary of modern Russian police, Viola starts her own investigation on trying to locate the girl's family, not knowing what a deadly game she has just pulled herself into. Everyone who might know something about her new friend keeps dying in the most horrible ways possible, but there is no stopping Viola and eventually, through much life threatening hardships, she is able to reunite the girl with her family and help throw the murderers behind bars. But that was all just the beginning, because Viola, or "Vilka" (Fork) to her friends and family, decided that being a sleuth is now her new hobby, and embarks on a series of amazing adventures, filled with murders and deceit, no matter how hard her new boyfriend, the chief of police, tries to stop her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641071</url></doc>
