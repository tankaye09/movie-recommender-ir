<plot>Monitor tells the story of four people, two young girls who take a trip to their local 24hr garage, an early morning commuter who is late for work and abandons his car on the M50, and a mysterious woman who has an emotional encounter with a bottle of perfume. These three stories are tied together by their presence on a wall of CCTV screens, which are being watched by Mr Adams &amp; Mr Zuckerman, two security guards who dispassionately monitor the events that unfold throughout the day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375650</url></doc>
