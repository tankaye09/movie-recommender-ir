<plot>Jessica Blaine (a 23-year old art student) and her half-sister Caroline (a 28-year old former model who ruined her career by participating too much in New York's decadent night life) return to Jessica's apartment after an evening of club-hopping. They and their friends, including Jessica's French boyfriend Albert and his cousin Jules, proceed to give the evening one last burst of debauched revelry. The next morning, Jessica and Caroline receive some bad news: their wealthy father, Mr. Blaine, has tired of supporting his daughters and has decided to financially cut off both of them. This causes the two women to re-evaluate their lives. Jessica must figure out what is most important to her: family, Albert, or her studies. Caroline may be forced to trade in spending sprees at Barney's for the occasional splurge at Old Navy. Both women deal with their impending unwanted financial independence in different ways, as Mr. Blaine and his assistant Benton arrive into town to confront Jessica and Caroline. His decision will forever alter their lives, and their relationships to one another.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015799</url></doc>
