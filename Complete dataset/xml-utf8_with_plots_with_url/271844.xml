<plot>Jack be Nimble is a film about a group of young men traveling across the country in a beat up RV in order to compete in a series of stunt inline skating competitions. They belong to a small subculture of athletes that has been banished from the now mainstream world of extreme sports. Along the way they try to establish their community as a 'real' sport deserving of respect from mainstream culture, while at the same time discovering that the activity which once represented rebellion, innocence and individuality has brought them to a crossroads between growing up and following their passion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271844</url></doc>
