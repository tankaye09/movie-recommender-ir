<plot>The story of how the movie _Gone to Earth (1950)_ (qv) was made in and around the Shropshire villages of Much Wenlock and Snailbeach. It was a very unusual movie in that there were only a few actors but over 300 local people were used as extras. This documentary was made with the help of The Mary Webb Society and interviews many of the surviving locals who were used as extras.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243176</url></doc>
