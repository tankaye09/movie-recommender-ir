<plot>Being a teenager is not all fun and games, even when you have your license and your own car. It's kind of like being a kid at an amusement park, you're too tall for the kiddie rides but too short for the coasters. Rene, Mark, Dirt and Scott wish they could be legal age, like their friend Al and yet Al doesn't understand why they aren't just simply loving their teenage years. Under age drinking! Being brought home by the police! Sex with lots of girls! Man, why aren't these guys living it up like he did? The boys do have fun, but there is only so much time spent at bowling alleys and pool halls that these boys can handle. They invent their own fun at the local Toys A Lot where they stir up perhaps a little bit too much fun and ruckus while debating the virtues of teenage life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652979</url></doc>
