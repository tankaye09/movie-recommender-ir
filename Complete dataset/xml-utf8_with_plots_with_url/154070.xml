<plot>Lee comes home to find that his finance, Anna, has had a mysterious accident, and is acting a bit "strange." Babbling hysterically that it wasn't her fault, Anna blames her stuffed animal, Doggie. Lee, confused, tries to comfort Anna, and as a result, has an accident of his own. Over the course of the next three days, Anna and Doggie will test Lee's limits to the breaking point and beyond.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154070</url></doc>
