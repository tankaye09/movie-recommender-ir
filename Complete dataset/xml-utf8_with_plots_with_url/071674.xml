<plot>"I used to have dreams where I would go shopping in a department store. But when looking down I would realize I forgot to put on my clothes. I was afraid that maybe I exposed and revealed myself too much through my films or drawings. I don't put myself into my movies because that would be too much - my pictures reflect my own feelings. So hopefully it's entertaining. Otherwise I can't bear looking at them, ha ha!" -MK In this dream-portrait of Mike Kuchar, he floats through his memories as the sea, space and sky drift past. Wrapped in odd costumes, he frolics with the imaginary creatures surrounding him, and recalls the creatures of his own imagination.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071674</url></doc>
