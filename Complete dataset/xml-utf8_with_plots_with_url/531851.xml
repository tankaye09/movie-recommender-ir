<plot>The story of Tasmanian-born actor Errol Flynn whose short &amp; flamboyant life, full of scandals, adventures, loves and excess was largely played out in front of the camera - either making movies or filling the newsreels and gossip magazines. Tragically he was dead from the effects of drugs and alcohol by the time he was only 50 &amp; the myths live on. But there is another side of Flynn that is less well known - his ambitions to be a serious writer and newspaper correspondent, his documentary films and his interest in the Spanish Civil War and Castro's Cuba</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?531851</url></doc>
