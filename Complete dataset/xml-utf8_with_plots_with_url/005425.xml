<plot>Jay, 25, finds a cryptic message that he's written to himself during an alcohol infused moment of clarity, and ventures out into Saturday night with his best friend Conti, hoping to understand the words. They meet two girls, Conti gives into temptation and cheats on his girlfriend, but Jay connects with the other, and confesses both to her and to himself that it's been a year to the day since his father died. He calls his mother up, who deciphers the written message, based on what Jay's dad was like at 25.</plot><plot>Jay, 25, finds a cryptic message that he's written to himself during an alcohol infused moment of clarity, and ventures out into Saturday night with his best friend Conti, hoping to understand the words.
