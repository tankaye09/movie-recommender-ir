<plot>An intimate portrait of the challenges, successes and assimilation of an Hispanic immigrant community in rural America. In 1986 Mexican immigrants moved to upstate New York looking for a safer and more tranquil way of life. They had immigrated to Newburgh New York, but, deteriorating economic conditions, crime and inferior schools lead them to find a better situation for their families. Twenty years later, the Hispanic Immigrant community in Fleischmanns accounts for at least 30% of the population. Discover the ways these families have assimilated into the community through successful businesses and successes of the second generation children in the local School system. The village of Fleischmanns is a bright spot of hope as two cultures reach out to each other in friendship and understanding.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068888</url></doc>
