<plot>Two short dramas about discovering romance in odd places. In the first part, Sasaki is a struggling salesman, browbeaten by his customers, his boss and his wife. Needing to escape from his frustrations, he wanders into an abandoned house and goes to sleep on the floor. He wakes up to find a beautiful young woman standing over him. They talk, and soon grow attracted to each other. As their relationship develops, Sasaki finds that his work and home life also improve. The second story is about Saeko, a young girl who is introduceed to the world of "enjo kosai," or dating older men for money, by her friend Yukari. She is shy at first, but soon becomes more relaxed (and jaded) with experience. This all comes to an end, however, when she meets Toshi, and she must decide whether her cynical outlook is really what she wants in life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485735</url></doc>
