<plot>This three-part series Hollywood Inc lifts the lid on Hollywood howlers, including how close the highest-grossing movie ever, Titanic (above), came to never being finished -- and how badly behaved stars can double a fifty million dollar movie. Insiders reveal the lengths to which some studios will go to ensure their movie takes the No. 1 position at the US box office. Tune in to learn the secrets Hollywood's big players would probably prefer you didn't know.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243561</url></doc>
