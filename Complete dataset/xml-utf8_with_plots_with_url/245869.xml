<plot>An excellent picture secured on the Esplanada of the Pan-American Exposition, showing the live stock exhibitor's exposition of prize winners at the Pan-American. Here we show some of the most beautiful horsees ever presented, the animals having been gathered from all sections of North America. The exhibition begins with Kentucky thoroughbreds, who prance by the camera and form a decided contrast with the great broad chested Canadian draft horses. The horses pass our camera in parade form, being led or driven by their owners, and the entire parade is headed by a full band.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245869</url></doc>
