<plot>Satyaprakash and his wife live in a poor community of mill workers. Satyaprakash is a union leader, and this puts him in deadly conflict with the mill management and he is killed, leaving behind his pregnant wife. His wife gets accused of killing her husband, is found guilty, and imprisoned. While in prison, she gives birth to a baby boy, Azaad, and passes away. Thus orphaned, Azaad depends on the big-hearted people in this poor community. When he grows up, Azaad takes to petty crime and acts like a modern day Robinhood. His girlfriend, Roopa, wants him to get suitable employment, and stop being a gangster and thief. Azaad gets a job as a police inspector, but he does not give up on his Robinhood style, and does everything in his power to accept bribes, and condone criminals for a hefty fee. When questioned, he openly states that he does not keep the money for himself, but instead uses it for the needy in his community. Then the death of a honest Havaldar named Hari creates a change in Azaad, a change that will put him in conflict with the local gangsters, as well as with the people he has been striving so hard to help.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379453</url></doc>
