<plot>It isn't a really good day in the life of caveman Brog. His wife Oola has just thrown out most of his stuff. Apparently she wants a tidy cave. But Brog isn't ready to part from his belongings yet. He is especially attached to his mysterious stone which he uses for hunting. This day he isn't very lucky however. With an empty stomach and soaked by rain, he returns home. Close to his, he hears Oola screaming. The cave is under attack by a vicious bear. Brog doesn't hesitate a moment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263430</url></doc>
