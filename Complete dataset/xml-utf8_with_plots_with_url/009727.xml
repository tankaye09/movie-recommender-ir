<plot>Things are not always as they seem, especially when entering the halls of a desperate mind. Ann Brown is a prosecutor with the DA's office. On the surface, she appears to be a powerful, successful woman who knows what path she is on. However, inside she is fighting desperately to keep her fragile sanity from unraveling. Following a controversial win in a double-homicide trial that is sure to set a new precedence, Ann is offered a murder case from her superior, Harold Shenson. This case will challenge everything she holds sacred and believes to be true. Uncertain at first whether to accept the assignment, a harrowing encounter with Defense Attorney Tom Condan, convinces her to meet the challenge. During the process, Ann discovers that in this particular case, once again, things are not as they appear. The deeper she investigates, the grayer the line becomes between reality and her tormenting delusions, until she encounters an evil force as unnerving as it is foreboding. As terrifying secrets are exposed, the culmination is a shocking twist that reveals the chilling truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009727</url></doc>
