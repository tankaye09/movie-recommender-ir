<plot>This film first shows a perspective view of the Upper Lerfoss Falls, at the side of which is an Electric Generating Station, supplying the electric light to the town of Trondhjim, by energy derived from the Fall. Next is shown the lower fall at a closer range. A fine idea of the tremendous and powerful rush of water, which seethes up to a great height. By a panoramic device the camera then follows the torrent, showing the speed at which the water travels after leaving the falls. An excellent picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329544</url></doc>
