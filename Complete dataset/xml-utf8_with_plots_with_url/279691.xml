<plot>JOT was a bouncing dot that was sensitive to the inner thoughts and feelings of a child, and changed it's shape and color as it depicted the struggles represented by a child's conscience, such as joy and sadness. When it realigned itself with its inner standards, the dot reverted back to its perfect round shape. It also had a very expressive face which displayed emotion as well as moral turmoil.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279691</url></doc>
