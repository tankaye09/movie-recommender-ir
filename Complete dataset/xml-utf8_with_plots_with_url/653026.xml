<plot>Kelly has always had eccentric taste in men, but no one was prepared for Kelly's latest paramour. It turns out that the current love of her life is none other than Boba Fett, the bad-boy bounty hunter from the Star Wars movies. Except... He's the silent type... really silent. He's got an edge... His stare is disarming... And he's not much for dancing, but still, Kelly sees the world in him. Is there a future for these two? Can a girl from California find love with maybe one of the biggest icons in the Star Wars universe? Or is he just too one-dimensional to make the relationship work? The answer lies in our own galaxy, in a city not that far away.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653026</url></doc>
