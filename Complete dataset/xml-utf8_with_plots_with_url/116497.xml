<plot>Anna and her artist father, Jack, are packing up a painting for delivery to a wealthy woman's house, Mrs. Soenso. At the house, The father and daughter enter unknown territory and the father feels ashamed of his attire and his daughter's dirty feet. They both notice a couch in the shape of lips. Mrs. Soenso descends the staircase and is surprised to see Anna with the artist. The woman tells the young girl that she will be giving her father a tour of the house but Anna will have to stay put. As Mrs. Soenso spews critiques of the art in her house, Anna cautiously wanders over to the luscious couch and explores. She gets caught and learns a lesson in art vs. function.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?116497</url></doc>
