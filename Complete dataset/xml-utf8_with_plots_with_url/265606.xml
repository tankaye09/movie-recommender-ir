<plot>Four players are asked a series of questions. Each question has three possible answers, the last of which is always "None of the above." The players have three seconds to lock in their guess with the corresponding button on their podium. As many questions are asked as time permits, usually 20 to 25. At the end of the round, the Inquizitor gives out a severe tongue-lashing to the player with the fewest correct answers, and that player is eliminated from the game. The scores are reset to start each new round, and play continues in this matter until only one player remains. The winner receives $500.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265606</url></doc>
