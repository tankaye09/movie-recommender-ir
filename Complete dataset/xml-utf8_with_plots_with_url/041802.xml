<plot>Belfast, Christmas 1999. A poor, badly dressed woman is half walking, half stumbling down the road. She is tearful and her behaviour is so disturbed that passers-by look furtively at her before hurrying on. Her walk is purposeful though. She is hurrying to go somewhere specific. She stumbles towards a church that is lit up. As she approaches it we see a sign outside announcing "SERVICE FOR PEACE Belfast Christmas together. All Denominations, 8pm"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041802</url></doc>
