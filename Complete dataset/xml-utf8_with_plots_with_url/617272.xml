<plot>This all takes place in a fictional underground, conformed society. A graffiti artist, with the target name TREK 183, is on the run from after being held under confinement for many years where he was forced to sketch blueprints of tall building structures. Trek has just escaped from this confinement and is now in search for a higher truth, an existence that many people, including his closest friend, is oblivious to. With the blueprints in his possession, Standard Officers are in hot pursuit to confiscate them and throw Trek back into confinement. Tonight, Trek will try to escape to the outside world but the conformists aren't all that stand in his way. Trek will encounter several obstacles before realizing his true purpose in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617272</url></doc>
