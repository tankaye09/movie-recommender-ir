<plot>Patty, a 8-year-old boy, has suffered from a serious road accident that has ruptured his spine beyond repair. His father Jossy a widower is devastated after hearing from the doctor that Patty is paralyzed for life with no movement in both his hands and legs. His daughter Carol, a medical student, helps him emotionally and takes up the challenge to nurse Patty. But events take a wrong turn and Jossy decides to give euthanasia to his son even though it is illegal in India. The film climaxes with the intervention of our lord Jesus Christ in form of innocent words said by Patty on Christmas. Hope and belief in God ultimately helps Jossy stop the slide down the slippery slope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203452</url></doc>
