<plot>What's Your Problem" by Mark Serao, Chris Vaglio, and Matt Horutz Set against the backdrop of a New Jersey suburban town, What's Your Problem? is a comedy/action short film that tells the struggling story of a self-started private detective company, "What's Your Problem?," and their unorthodox methods of investigation. Wilson, age 29 (Team Leader), and his specialist team, Audrey (Chameleon -Mistress of Disguise), Tyler (Professional Bad Ass), and Dale (Technology and Gadgetry), are running a private investigation company out of Wilson's parent's garage. Although Wilson and his team have no formal business credibility or professional law enforcement training of any kind, they solve cases by using their own brand of logic and specialized talents, or so they think. As the story unfolds, the police threaten Wilson and his team with an ultimatum. If they screw up one more time, their business is through. Proceeding with utmost caution, Wilson and the team struggle to successfully solve their upcoming cases, while trying to stay out of the police's hair, and ultimately, preventing their business from closing its doors forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652371</url></doc>
