<plot>Most people believe modern-day kickboxing originated in Thailand, Japan or elsewhere in the Far East. In fact, it originated in America and is known by it's real name, full-contact karate. During the mid-seventies, various American tournament karate practitioners became frustrated with the limitations of the then primitive competitive scoring system. They wanted to find a system within which they could apply kicks and punches to the knockout. Full-contact karate was born. From there it jumped to Asia and the Far East. Set amid the old-world charm of the Bukovina region of the Ukraine, it follows an exuberant group of youngsters, ages eight to sixteen, as they prepare for an athletic demonstration at the local sports stadium. These fresh-faced athletes may look sweet and innocent, but don't let the blush of youth fool you. As they strap on gear and limber up lithe young muscles, it's clear they mean serious business. Each one is a master of deadly precision with punches, kicks, and spins. They know how to be playful boys too.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290816</url></doc>
