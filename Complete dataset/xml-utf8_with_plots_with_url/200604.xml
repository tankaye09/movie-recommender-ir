<plot>The Spanish Civil War and the October 1986 reunion of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade serve as the backdrop to Judith Montell's documentary on these heroic veterans and their years of activism. The members, many of whom are Jewish and now in their 70s and 80s, were filmed and interviewed as they retraced their steps on the old battlefields of Spain. The group's journey through Spain becomes a metaphor for their lives of ongoing commitment to social justice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200604</url></doc>
