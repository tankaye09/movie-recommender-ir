<plot>Calvin (Nicholas Price) is a late-twentysomething hipster who, while out nightclubbing with his equally cynical pals, meets and becomes smitten with a beautiful, too-good-to-be-true brunette named Alexia (Ina Strauss). Initially she plays seductively to his self image as a wry ladies man, by looking like "Miss Betty Page, with just a hint of Vampira" and strip teasing to Manciniesque music, but the evening takes several unexpected turns and and in their wake both parties soon find themselves struggling to retain even the smallest glimmer of self-respect .</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?512921</url></doc>
