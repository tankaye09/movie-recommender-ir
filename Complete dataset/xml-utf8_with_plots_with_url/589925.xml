<plot>Hometown pride and personal responsibility is satirized in this comedic short which, truly, is not about hockey. It's April, 2003, and the reigning Stanley Cup Champions (Detroit Red Wings) are about to be swept in the first round playoffs by the lowly Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Dan, an otherwise normal hard-working guy is the ultimate fan, or the 'seventh man,' who has lost all perspective on what's really important. Dan and his patient wife, Jen, and are expecting a baby. And although Jen is also a die-hard Red Wings fan, her priorities are balanced in a way that her loving, but insufferable husband can only imagine. Warning: Some language is entirely inappropriate to sensitive ears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589925</url></doc>
