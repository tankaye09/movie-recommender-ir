<plot>The "Rated K Update" was a short show that aired during commercial breaks on Nickelodeon from 1988-1990. It was originally hosted by Brad Kane of "Aladdin" fame, and featured brief interviews with famous young stars, some of which included Chad Allen and Alyssa Milano. Toward the end of its run it featured other young hosts that would report from the Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, which opened in 1990. In each "episode" they tied in entertainment, politics and other subjects that were relevant to kids.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?455950</url></doc>
