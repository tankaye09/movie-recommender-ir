<plot>Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection. The lovers, the dreamers and me." Send Me An Angel is a snapshot of 24 hours in the life of Ronny, a hopeless romantic who spends his 30th birthday looking for love in all the wrong places. Ronny is still carrying a torch for his ex-boyfriend, who extinguishes any remaining embers of hope when he shows up to say he is moving to America to be with his new lover. When Ronny places an ad on a chat line looking for masculine "army-types", a blond, twink hustler named Sahar answers his call. Sahar doesn't quite match the profile Ronny was looking for and he kicks him out of his apartment without so much as cab fare home. Fate intervenes and the two bump into each other later in the evening at an outdoor rave where a friend of Sahar tries to rough up Ronny over their earlier misadventure. The mismatched pair spend the evening wandering the streets together and Sahar once again ends up on Ronny's doorstep. What follows is an intimate insight into the hearts of two people, each with their own emotional scars, as they let down their guard, get to know each other and take a chance on love. Ultimately, Send Me An Angel is about letting go of past loves and of the preconceptions of who the next one may be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485747</url></doc>
