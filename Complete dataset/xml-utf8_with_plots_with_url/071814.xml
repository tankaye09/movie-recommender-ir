<plot>BIRTH OF INDUSTRY is a contemporary allegory that explores the dualism of industry and nature. Maya, a young woman, emerges mysteriously from the ocean to give birth to her son, Joseph. Joseph quickly grows from infancy to adolescence and ventures into the industrialized world leaving his Mother behind. In the desperate pursuit of her son, Maya is subjected to a series of torturous rituals that serve to corrupt her state of natural being. Joseph, now an adult and himself a by-product of industry, is discovered by Maya to be the chief mechanism of her suffering. In an act of cosmic retribution Maya unleashes her motherly powers reducing him to the infant he once was and takes him with her back into the ocean.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071814</url></doc>
