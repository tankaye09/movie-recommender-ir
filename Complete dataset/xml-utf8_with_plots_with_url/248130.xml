<plot>This special spotlights the communicative aspects of 9/11 by dealing with the event from an oral history perspective, as well as how news of 9/11 was transmitted through electronic media. Personal testimony and interviews recount how radio dispatchers and the like did their jobs with a combination of training, instinct and grace, while trying to decipher the various conflicting accounts provided by well-meaning eyewitnesses and the frantic calls of those trapped in the Towers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248130</url></doc>
