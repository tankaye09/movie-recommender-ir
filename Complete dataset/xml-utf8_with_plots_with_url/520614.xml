<plot>Ever since Malcolm Holt's kindergarten teacher pinned a suicide note to his sweater, his life has been consumed with anger, concern, and mistrust. Now 22 and living at home, Malcolm is struggling to find his way as a developing photographer - until he begins having prophetic dreams about the direction his life is taking. As his suburban life falls apart, Malcolm seeks counsel from Gregory Crowley, better known around town as the Holy Hustler, a mystic and a pool shark. Meanwhile, Malcolm runs into his ex-girlfriend, Mara, rekindling things with her as his dreams predicted. His life on a seeming upswing, Malcolm is happier than he's been in years - until his best friend's suicide forces Malcolm to confront what he's been running from since kindergarten.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520614</url></doc>
