<plot>AirForce One, The original Boeing aircraft that transported Eight different American Presidents has been de-commissioned. This noble plane is due to become a permanent exhibit at The Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. However, in order to accomplish this task, the Plane must be completely dismantled and transported to the construction site; it's wings separated from the fuselage and a building constructed around the pieces. Using a combination of "Up to the Minute" digital technology and traditional timelapse photography, The Production team will document this unique procedure. The Project will include interviews with Former Presidents, and a celebrity Narrator.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027000</url></doc>
