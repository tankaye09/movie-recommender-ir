<plot>Trevor is a recluse who believes the only way of dealing with the death of his murdered wife Jasmine is by abusing drugs and alcohol, attempting to NUMB the pain. His depression sinks into a suicidal state as he visualizes the life he once shared with his lost soul mate. The haunting visions begin to drive Trevor's sense of reality into the brink of insanity. A memoir of a tortured soul whose journey this past year has left him with only one place to go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402744</url></doc>
