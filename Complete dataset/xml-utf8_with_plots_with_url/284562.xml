<plot>Pictures watched in "kaizer panorama" don't have the notion of the beginning and the ending as they are represented in cycles. In the meantime once cinema starts, it must certainly end. Since cinema has the property that changes eyes itself, space in cinema changes. In this movie, deformation doesn't mean distortion but is kept as the sign of the motion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284562</url></doc>
