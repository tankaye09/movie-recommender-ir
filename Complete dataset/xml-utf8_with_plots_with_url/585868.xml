<plot>Shane O'Hanlaghn is a young man from London recruited by the army after a prolonged period of unemployment. He arrives unannounced in Glasgow to spend his last free days with Owen, a childhood friend. Demanding attention, and expecting a drinking spree, Shane is disturbed to discover that Owen's new life has no place for an unruly, violent friend. Over 24 hours, Shane drives a wedge between Owen and everything that makes him happy. This is a film that asks the question, is the only way to heal a destructive friendship to end it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585868</url></doc>
