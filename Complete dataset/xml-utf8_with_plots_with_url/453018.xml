<plot>It started in the 1600's. Brutal races between fire departments to get "first water" on a fire. It has evolved into a technically advanced, super-intense competition between New York volunteer fire departments. Drill Team Racing pits teams against the clock and against each other in high-speed, dangerously competitive events using ladders, hoses, bucket brigades and racing trucks that even NASCAR would envy. Race for Glory captures all the action, injuries, excitement and disappointment of Drill Team Racing. Quotes from the Guys: "It's important to preserve the legacy of what this is." "Nowhere in the world do they do what we do." "If you gotta ask why I do it, then you'll never understand." "I've got two saves. I've pulled two people out of buildings and I'm sure they don't care whether I'm volunteer or paid."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453018</url></doc>
