<plot>The Coney Island Jockey Club's Suburban Handicap race was won by the three-year-old bay colt Africander, with the best and most seasoned horses in training at his heels. He took the lead in the stretch, and for the final quarter of a mile flew down the track at a pace that astonished the crowd. Africander won from Herbert by a head. Hunter Raine was third. None who witnessed the race will soon forget the finish. After the race, the camera revolved to the left, bringing into view the rider of Africander, seated in floral chain, and the cheering multitudes in the grand-stand.</plot><plot>The Coney Island Jockey Club's Suburban Handicap race was won by the three-year-old bay colt Africander, with the best and most seasoned horses in training at his heels.
