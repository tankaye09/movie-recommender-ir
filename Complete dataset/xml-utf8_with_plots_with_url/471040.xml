<plot>The conservative talk show host mixes his own monologue with actual news footage, viewer videos, occasional phone calls, and rarely, guests. Nick Africano gathers public information from the streets of New York, while "Our Man in Washington" gathers material from media figures and politicians. "Our Woman in Washington" was added to the show when the elderly reporter yelled at Clinton "everything's going down the drain! Is that true?" and graciously accepted the semi-regular role. Often members of the crew would get on stage and do their thing, frequently Debra Phillips, with whom Rush would carry on arguments about such topics as "When is a hug sexual harassment?" Limbaugh terminated the show in 1996 after deciding the half-hour format, and its burial at the wee hours of the night was no longer an effective medium.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471040</url></doc>
