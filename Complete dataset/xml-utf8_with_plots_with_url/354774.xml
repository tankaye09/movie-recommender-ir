<plot>The year is two thousand and something. An elderly couple live alone in a flat in Sarajevo, with their own rituals: drinking coffee, playing cards, watching TV. The husband (Dad) has had a stroke and although he is still physically strong, he has difficulties in communication.

Dad must not allow that and he opposes it in the only way he can, with physical force.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354774</url></doc>
