<plot>"Left Unattended" conveys the heightened out look of National Security after the September 11th terrorist attacks; dealing with certain thoughts of suspicion and anxiety. Left Unattended places the audience in the environment of an MTA subway car and takes them threw a thought process of an everyday subway rider. Showing the comfort level of the main character in his environment, it suddenly breaks when the main character encounters a suspicious looking bag "left unattended" on the opposite side of his subway car. From that point onward his attitude changes. What he thought was a normal subway ride to work actually isn't. He's thrown into a situation that he can't handle, one that only he notices and everyone else is completely oblivious to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328332</url></doc>
