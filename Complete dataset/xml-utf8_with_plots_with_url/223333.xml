<plot>When the King of Bhutan decided to introduce democracy to his tiny Himalayan Kingdom, no one could have predicted that the people wouldn't want it. The King suggested that his country should be measured by its happiness and not Gross Domestic Product. What started as a throwaway comment by the King to a western journalist has become a global phenomenon. Now Bhutan has to step up to the plate. The King's father decided to measure his nation's wealth in terms of happiness instead of profit, introducing the notion of Gross National Happiness. As "Democracy" becomes corroded by corporate and international interests, corruption, violence, and apathy, the film explores the private world of the King as he prepares to hand over power to the people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?223333</url></doc>
