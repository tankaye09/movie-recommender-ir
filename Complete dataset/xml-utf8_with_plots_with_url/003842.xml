<plot>The New England Patriots' historic 2003 season is reviewed. 2003 began with a 4-0 preseason slate of games during which the Patriots got good looks at numerous new members alongside their established veterans. But entering the opening game against Drew Bledsoe's Buffalo Bills, safety Lawyer Milloy was suddenly cut by the Patriots, to the consternation of the team and the fans, and when the Bills picked Milloy up, the result was a miserable 31-0 shutout win by Buffalo. But the Patriots responded the nesxt week in Philidelphia with a rousing 31-10 victory, during which tackle Roosevelt Colvin was injured and had to sit out the season. More injuries knocked out several starters in a close win over the New York Jets, and after a demoralizing 20-17 loss in Washington, injuries had eaten into the Pats' starting line. But beginning with Week Five, the Patriots hunkered down and began getting game-winning play from darkhorse starters and their corps of rookies. The Patriots defeated the heavily-favored Tennessee Titans in Week Five and from there on the Patriots' season never looked back, with wins against the Giants, a spectacular OT win in Miami (the team's first in Miami during the hot months of September and October ever) a FG win over Cleveland, and a spectacular TD win in Denver. With a shutout win over the Cowboys, an OT win in Houston, and a spectacular goalline stand at Indy, the Patriots ended the competitive phase of their season as division champs. They ran out December with three shutout wins highlighted by perfect revenge over Buffalo. Then came the playoffs and the run to Superbowl XXXVIII.</plot><plot>The New England Patriots' historic 2003 season is reviewed. 2003 began with a 4-0 preseason slate of games during which the Patriots got good looks at numerous new members alongside their established veterans.
