<plot>Because I Said So is a frank - not necessarily polite - half hour of television that takes the piss out of the entertainment industry. Hosted by lawyer, turned comic, turned TV diva Maggie Cassella, Because I Said So invites celebrity guests to rant about some of their favorite and not so favorite realities of the industry. From Hollywood's invention of size zero to its exploitation of Ground Zero, to whatever happened to Zero Mastel, Maggie brazenly refuses to kneel at the alter of celebrity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062758</url></doc>
