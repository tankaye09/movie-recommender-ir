<plot>A large multi-storied building formerly known as "Play House", where actors used to stage various plays, but after the plays stopped, came to be known as "Pila House" a place where prostitutes reside and sell their bodies for a price. It is at this location that several women are abducted or lured to, and forced into prostitution. Some women do it voluntarily to feed their families, some do it for the money, others are forced to live this life as they are unable to rehabilitate themselves. Into this atmosphere of pimps, lusty police officers, drug addicts, single mothers, and prostitutes comes beautiful Kasturibai from Benaras. She does not want to be a mere prostitute but wants to make it big in the call-girl and escort services where she can demand twice as much money. For this purpose, she decides to learn English from a young man named Masterji, who offers to teach her without charging any fees. Subsequently, Masterji and Kasturi fall in love with each other and decide to elope and marry. Helping Kasturi through this time of transition is Madhav, a waiter, who supplies tea, drinks, and snacks to all residents and visitors in this building. He even gets her a red Saree so that she can wear it on her wedding day. He accompanies her and leaves her at the spot where she is to meet with Masterji, and bids her adieu. Then Masterji shows up and it is then Kasturi finds out what his plans for her are - and none of them include married life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161795</url></doc>
