<plot>Episode 8 - "Dragons &amp; Giants" The Galapagos Marine Iguana is endemic to the Galapagos Islands and is the only iguana in the world that has fully adapted to a marine habitat. Dr. Martin Wikelski is studying a fascinating phenomenon whereby the iguanas instinctively shrink in body size during adverse environmental conditions; not just in body weight, but bone size and density. By studying these iguanas, Dr. Wikelski hopes that he may discover a future cure for osteoporosis in humans. Along with the abundance of unique wildlife in the Galapagos Archipelago there are also many creatures here on the verge of extinction. Perhaps the most famous resident of these Islands is "Lonesome George". Listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the loneliest animal in the world, "Lonesome George" is in fact the only known survivor of his species - the Pinta Island Giant Tortoise. Using the latest, military infrared camera technology, the Quest's helicopter and a very willing scientist embarked upon a mission to save George and continue this pre-historic species.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024325</url></doc>
