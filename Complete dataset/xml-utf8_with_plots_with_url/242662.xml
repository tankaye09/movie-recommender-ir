<plot>In this character-driven comedy set in the streets of New York City, a young man who likes to call random phone numbers from the phone book to meet women gets into trouble with the angry line of people waiting to use the phone. When he's ripped from the phone both he just finds another one and starts dialing for dates all over again. The humor doesn't end until the last credit rolls so don't stop watching until the very end and you will see some very famous faces! Look for a cameo from Ron Howard.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?242662</url></doc>
