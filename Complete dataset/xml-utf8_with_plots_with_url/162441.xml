<plot>Karam Singh is an orphaned farmer who wants to wed Thibo. His father-in-law wants him to claim his land from his unscrupulous paternal uncles, and when he does so, he is told that the land does not belong to him. Enraged he threatens them and their one and only witness. Shortly thereafter the witness is killed, the police arrive to arrest him, but he manages to escape and joins a group of bandits to try and get his land back. He openly warns everyone that whoever tries to till his farmland, he will challenge and kill them. His uncles hire some goons, who, after a shootout with Karam, are killed. Then a wealthy male, Dev, the only son of Mohanlal, arrives to buy the land.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162441</url></doc>
