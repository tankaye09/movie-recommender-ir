<plot>Pocahontas is a beautiful, young Indian princess traveling with her husband, John Rolfe, and son, Thomas, to London to see John's birthplace. She is awed by the activity and the largeness of London. However, Pocahontas soon falls ill with the plague. Once, when Pocahontas and John are entering their hotel, they are approached by Captain John Smith. Pocahontas is extremely upset, having thought John was dead for a long time. Her husband apologizes on her behalf, explaining she is ill. She asks him to come again. Pocahontas is a young girl at the age of twelve when she first sees the English settlers of Jamestown. Curious and brave, Pocahontas befriends the colony and persuades her father to help them survive through the winter. This act of kindness brings peace between the Indians and the settlers. As food grows scarce for the settlers, they steal from the Indians. The Indians capture Captain John Smith, intending to kill him. Pocahontas saves his life by "claiming him for her own." Captain Smith sails shortly thereafter and is presumed dead. When Pocahontas grows into a young woman, she is captured by members of the Jamestown colony and is held as ransom for supplies from her father. John Rolfe is placed as her guard. As summer turns to fall, and fall turns to winter, John and Pocahontas fall in love. He teaches her to read the books John Smith had given her before he left. When Pocahontas is released to her father again, the settlers demand their supplies. Once again Pocahontas risks her life in order to maintain peace. Both the Indians and the settlers are forced to give in as the "peace of Pocahontas" is known.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436615</url></doc>
