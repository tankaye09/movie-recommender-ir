<plot>Holly is having difficulty at home with her seventy year old husband, Manny. He is wandering in the middle of night, confusing the past with the present, and disassociating common routines and objects with their meaning. After taking him to see the family doctor, she finds out he has symptom of Alzheimer's called Sundowner's Syndrome. With her children busy with lives of their own and differing opinions as to their father's state, Holly tries to take care of him on her own. That evening, Holly is struck in the head during one of Manny's episodes. While unconscious, Holly dreams of the past life she had with Manny. She remembers their first meeting, how they reconnected years later and the birth of their first child. She wakes up in the hospital, her children at her side. They try to convince her to sign commitment papers to put Manny in a nursing home. She decides to hire help instead, choosing to spend as much time as she has remaining with the man she loves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?594310</url></doc>
