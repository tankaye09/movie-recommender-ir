<plot>Some memories return in an instant, with focus sharper than the clearest photo. The people who've affected our lives never really disappear. YASAMIN spent eight years dodging a single question. When she unexpectedly runs into ex-lover LENA, will she finally get her answer? Stifled in a loveless marriage almost by default, will Lena forgive Yasamin for leaving all those years ago? They'll throw their lives into chaos for a chance to find out. LaughcrY explores our desires and our reluctance to test those desires. Yasamin and Lena were college lovers who never put their relationship to the test. Meeting again eight long years later, they remember the laughter, but it's the tears that are hardest to forget.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321250</url></doc>
