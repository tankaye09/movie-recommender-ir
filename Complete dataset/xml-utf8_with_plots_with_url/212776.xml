<plot>Edinburgh - world renowned for its stunning beauty: the Athens of the North. At its heart is the city's New Town, a feast of interesting stories which are woven into the fabric of its outstanding architecture. In this video we bring you some of these tales through the medium of Adam Lyal (deceased). Hanged in 1811 for highway robbery, Adam Lyal is Edinburgh's most celebrated ghost. Following the success of Adam Lyal's Royal Mile, this affable, amusing and ashen-faced phantom continues his exploration of this city's rich past. Guiding us through Edinburgh's Georgian New Town, he brings to life all the splendor, elegance and sophistication of a world of wonderful architecture, famous characters and intriguing stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212776</url></doc>
