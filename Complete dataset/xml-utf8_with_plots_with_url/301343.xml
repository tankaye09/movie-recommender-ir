<plot>A Spanish cleaning lady arrives in Aix en Provence the same day her son is being judged for murder. The public defender does what is in her hands, but she cannot avoid a sentence to life imprisonment. The victim was his fiancée, a girl everyone in town knew. In a face-to-face meeting, the son tells his mother about his innocence. With the assistance of the public defender, and then of a police inspector who realizes there are some dark spots in the case, she starts a double procedure: she will face the blind and deaf justice and the media, as well as the xenophobic and conservative society. Her actions, even if direct and sincere, lead to many problems. Finally, after having gathered many evidences that prove his son's innocence but are not enough to reopen the case, the mother finds out the culprit: a rich industrialist of the area. As she has no more options, the mother starts a hunger strike to oblige the institutions to reopen the case and to get the industrialist to get himself up. Will she achieve her objective? Will her son be released from prison?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?301343</url></doc>
