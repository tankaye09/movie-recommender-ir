<plot>Two men call on a physician for treatment. The doctor seats one to his left and the other to his right, and then proceeds to give them the battery. They squirm and twist until the current is shut off. They are then introduced to a lung tester, in which they both blow. One of the patients is immediately covered with flour which is discharged by the instrument, while the other receives a volume of black powder directly between the eyes. This is a corker.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174995</url></doc>
