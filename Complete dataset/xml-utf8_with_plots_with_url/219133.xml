<plot>Adapted from an award-winning play, Goldfish is the surreal story of a man haunted by his own nightmares and fantasies, with nothing to keep him company but the phone book and a hoover-wielding demon that lives in his cupboard. Trapping himself in a boarded-up room, he is thrown from moment to moment never knowing what bizarre experience he will go through next. From a desolate beach to the weirdest date he's ever been on, the man embarks on a funny and disturbing journey without ever leaving his room. As he begins to lose his tenuous grip on reality, increasingly losing himself in his fantasies and visions of an idyllic past, we start to realize that he may be losing something more than just his mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219133</url></doc>
