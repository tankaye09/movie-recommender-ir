<plot>Kyle Reid, your average small-town kid, returns home wishing he'd gone to a better college and had a richer father. He finds himself caught up in his old group of friends who all have it better than him. The one thing they have in common; is a plan. At 19, it's tough to meet girls. But these guys have it all worked out. When the bars close up, four of them corner her in a dark alley. She's scared; they call her names, rough her up. And when the remaining friend appears out of the shadows, it doesn't take much to pummel them all in a staged fight. She lets him walk her home. She's very grateful for the help. So grateful in fact, these boys end up having the best summer of their lives...until the fights become real...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490382</url></doc>
