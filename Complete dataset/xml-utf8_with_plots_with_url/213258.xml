<plot>Children of all ages will love this exercise video! Join Sqedunk, Athletic Anna, Miss Lori and their exercise buddies in learning 14 basic exercises. Athletic Anna will lead each exercise with an instruction on the proper way to do the exercise. Sqedunk and the rest of the group join Athletic Anna in sets of each one of the exercises. After the 14 exercises are done, the home audience will get a bonus of the silly, exercise routine Athletic Anna performs in the Traveling "Miss Lori Live" Show. The routine gets faster as all try and keep up with Miss Lori singing the song: John Jacob Jingle Hiemer Schmidt Rhymes, Silliness, Music, and a bit of energy make for a fun time as well as teaching children the basics in exercising and staying fit. Children today need some extra encouragement in learning the life-long skill of staying healthy and fit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213258</url></doc>
