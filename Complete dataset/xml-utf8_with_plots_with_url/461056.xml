<plot>Julia Illsley is caught in the middle of a battle of wills. Her daughter, Rebecca, was taken from her outside of school in broad daylight and she has been forced by the kidnappers into retrieving a much sought after object from a man with obvious and dangerous criminal ties. Now that the task has been complete, and there is literal blood on her hands, the real test of her strength will be called to the front as she heads towards to the final exchange; to get herself and her daughter out alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461056</url></doc>
