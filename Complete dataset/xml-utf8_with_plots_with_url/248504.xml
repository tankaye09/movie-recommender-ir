<plot>How to Breathe is a tale of friendship, family and the need to be cared for. The story follows the lead character, Boy, through his journey to becoming a adult. He is looking for direction - the parental figure he never had growing up as a latch-key kid. He finds guidance at the library in the form of a self help author. His misguided advice sends the boy to find peace and solace in unlikely places. Along the way the boy finds friendship in a mysterious girl. His strangely absent mother's long-winded answering machine messages are also there, pulling at him in all directions. Add it all up and the boy is certainly learning how to breathe in some of the most difficult of situations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248504</url></doc>
