<plot>Lizzie Borden, America's most famous "self-made orphan," was the prim lady accused of axing her parents to death in 1892. A media star from the start, Lizzie continues to draw an audience! A sardonic, entertaining, and original film that features 28 different "Bordenites" - from a forensic scientist to a rock star - including 3 people who have themselves adopted the name "Lizzie Borden." A lively retelling of the ever-popular mystery of Lizzie Borden, this film also raises deeper issues relating to history, feminism, and popular culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339454</url></doc>
