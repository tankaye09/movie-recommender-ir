<plot>Shakuntala (Mumtaz) is an estranged wife from Dushyant (Shatrughan Sinha) who wanted refused to admit that she is his wife because his political career would be hindered. His father (Om Shivpuri) never approved her because of her poverty and therefore decided to split them apart by blaming Dushyant for marrying her and because of that it would hinder his career. Shakuntala's life went from bad to worse when her father (Saeed Jaffrey) died after she returned home. Eighteen years later Dushyant is the Chief Minister and his son Vicki decided to take matters into his own hands in bringing back their parents together and conquering his grandfather's pride.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020511</url></doc>
