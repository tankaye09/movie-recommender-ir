<plot>A solitary man sits at his kitchen table in front of his computer. He's working on a text when a pop-up menu interrupts, inviting him to "give a spin" to Top Auction. He clicks and is shown an egg Santa/elf which has no bidders yet. He makes a bid of $5. Seconds later, another bidder bids $10. Our earnest man clicks on a button and becomes the current high bidder again; the screen shows he's bid just $5. Seconds later he's out bid, to a high bid of $10. The screen shows him ahead with a $5 bid, then behind a $10 bidder. He bids and rebids. He paces. Does he win?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564425</url></doc>
