<plot>"Ron, have you ever danced with a girl?," asks a dark-eyed hostess at the strip club where he's celebrating his 30th birthday. "No." How Ron, who has cerebral palsy and lives in a group home, got to the club and if he gets to dance with a girl, is the film's story. Ron is high-spirited as well as in need of help to get through daily life. For his thirtieth, the home has a party with hats and party favors, but it's not enough for the exuberant and sexually-aware Ron, who convinces Martin, one of his nurses, to take him to the club. A dancer inveigles Martin onto the dance floor so that Ron can be left to the hostess and his own devices, his chair and his pent-up joy for life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?467829</url></doc>
