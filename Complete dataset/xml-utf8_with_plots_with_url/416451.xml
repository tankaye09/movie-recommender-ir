<plot>The original screenplay of the Autumn Pastoral was written by Artavazd Peleshian for Armenfilm studio in Armenia. 'Mikhail Vartanov' (qv) wrote the usual "director's scenario" and composer Tigran Mansuryan improvised and recorded the score on the spot by looking at the final cut of Autumn Pastoral, which, like _Tsvet armyanskoy zemli (1969)_ (qv), contained no dialog. The film was shelved by the censors who ruled that the "poorly dressed villagers were embarrassing." Four years later Peleshian invited Vartanov to be the cinematographer of the Seasons of the Year _Vremena goda (1975)_ (qv), which explored the same theme of life of the shepherds in the mountains of Armenia. The fascinating differences are that Peleshian chose black and white and applied his editing method or "distance montage," while 'Mikhail Vartanov' (qv) selected color and directed in his usual style of the "observation of reality" or as it was later called "direction of undirected action."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?416451</url></doc>
