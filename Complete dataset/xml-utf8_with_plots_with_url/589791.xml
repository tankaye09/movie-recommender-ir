<plot>"Two grotesque minstrels are seen playing beneath a fair lady's window. She appears, and encourages one of them. The disappointed minstrel thereupon kicks the favored suitor with such force that it lifts him up to the second story window, and into the arms of the lady. This effect is very cleverly worked out, and makes a very amusing situation."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589791</url></doc>
