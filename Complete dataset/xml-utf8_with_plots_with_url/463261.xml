<plot>Some have never ridden the bus. Many have never thought about it. For others, the bus is the backbone of American transportation. Filmmaker Alan M. Whitney set out across America on the bus to meet these people. The result is the nostalgic film "Ridin' the Dog!" - an unauthorized and uncensored feature documentary that chronicles the stories, opinions and emotions of the riders encountered on the interstate bus system during this recent cross country trip. The riders touch on who they are, their wildest and most memorable experiences on the bus, their views on social issues such as Cuba, Katrina, immigration and Las Vegas and conclude with their message for the world. The film will make you gasp, laugh and cry as it exposes the full spectrum of subcultures of the regular bus riders from their mutual respect and willingness to help each other to their conquests, exploits and vices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?463261</url></doc>
