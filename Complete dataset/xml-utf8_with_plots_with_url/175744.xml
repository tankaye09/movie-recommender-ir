<plot>Five immigrants from five different countries get locked together in quarantine coming through Ellis Island during WW1 and learn of the possibility that only one will be allowed to enter. They go from not getting along with each other, to bonding as a team to assure that a pregnant runaway gets through so that her unborn child receives the life they themselves dream of.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175744</url></doc>
