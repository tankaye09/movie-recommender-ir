<plot>Sweden, 2008. Marianne lives in rural isolation with her brother Magnus, a young man of extraordinary beauty, and a gifted guitarist. The two siblings are unusually close - like male and female versions of the same soul. Magnus mysteriously disappears, setting Marianne on a trail of discovery which leads to Osaka, Japan. Here she meets the charismatic Tetsuo, a record producer who helped Magnus fulfill his musical vision. Thrown together in their search for Magnus, they are drawn into Osaka's underworld. As danger descends upon them, Tetsuo sacrifices himself for Marianne, freeing her to discover her brother's fate, and reclaim her identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?646911</url></doc>
