<plot>Police Inspector Rajesh's (Biswajeet) dad, also a police inspector, is killed while on duty. Rajesh swears that he will continue to do his duty, and bring the assailants to justice. Out of the four assailtants responsible, he is able to apprehend three of them, but the fourth one, namely Manmohan (Manhmohan Krishan) is elusive. Manmohan comes to know of the imprisonment of his colleagues, and arranges for them to dramatically escape from prison. Rajesh, in plainclothes, soon tracks them down in a manor run by Santosh (Sulochana), whose husband is none other than Manmohan. Rajesh loves Sheela (Rekha), who is the niece of Santosh. Sheela has a mute sister, Meera. One day Meera gets molested and the evidence points at Rajesh. With this cloud hanging over him, how will Rajesh carry on his investigation?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?364094</url></doc>
