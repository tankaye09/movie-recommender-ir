<plot>"There are no cute guys", laments Lexie, the clerk at the local comic store. This is the beginning of the odyssey that includes Bud, the love struck gaming geek, his friend Stan, Mike the would-be writer and Laslow Kincaid, a criminal legend in his own mind. While Laslow tutors Mike in the ways of crime, Stan tries to coach Bud into approaching Lexie. For her part, Lexie is the ringmaster of the circus. She moves from one storyline to the other and has a profound effect on both.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112037</url></doc>
