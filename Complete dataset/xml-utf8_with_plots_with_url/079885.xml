<plot>Following the death of his father during a motorbike race, Danny Stewart and his family are facing hard times. But Danny's grand passion is motor-cross and he wants to race too, just like his father. Fearing that Danny too will be killed, his mother forbids it. Ignoring his mother wishes, Danny strikes up a firm friendship with a retired motorbike mechanic, Buck McCoy. Together, they manage to scrape together enough to buy a bike. They start a gruelling training routine to prepare for the big race. If Danny can win it, he can not only make enough money to solve his family's money problems but also pursue the career of his dreams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079885</url></doc>
