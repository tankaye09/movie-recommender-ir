<plot>My Home - Your War takes us inside the home of an Iraqi family as they deal with the disruptions and terrors of war as it affects their daily lives. Layla is a middle class Iraqi woman, striking and intelligent - but the war is testing her most intimate relationships. Meet her shy teenage son who she suspects is working with the anti-US resistance; her steady but workaholic husband: and her once radical sister who is becoming increasingly conservative and religious as the chaos of Baghdad fuels her insecurities. Layla and her family give a revealing insight into the contrasting ways war and regime change strain close relationships, nurture extremism and change a family's destiny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384157</url></doc>
