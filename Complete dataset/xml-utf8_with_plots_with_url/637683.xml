<plot>Set in Feudal Japan during the reign of many warlords laying claim to the divine power of the fallen shogun, Vengeful Spirit is a modern opera of betrayal, vengeance, and struggle. After witnessing his family's death at the hands of the feudal lord Matsudaira, Katsu Takahashi grows up in the shadows wracked with guilt and hate. Years later, the boy emerges as a man torn apart, an existence aching with hatred. His sister, Sakura, has been taken in by their parents killers, a brooding empty existence of survival. Lord Matsudaira's power has grown, and he sits comfortably as a young lord in the fragmented Japanese rural provinces. But Katsu has not returned from his mysterious years of solitude with forgiveness in his heart. When the pain becomes unbearable, his animal instinct for revenge consumes him, forcing him to confront his family's killers. One by one, the killers fall victim to a shadow with a burning fury that takes there lives. For each one he kills, Katsu feels not satisfied, but gains a bloodlust that demands to be satiated. He stalks them all, vengeful spirits consuming him. The vengeance can be satiated only by the death of Lord Matsudaira himself, who has waited patiently for Katsu ever since that fateful bloody night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?637683</url></doc>
