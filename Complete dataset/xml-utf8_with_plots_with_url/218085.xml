<plot>Set in the south of the Ukraine is a real, modern-day orphanage, offering hope to all who step though its doors. A well-kept institution filled with 236 youngsters, either without parents, or born into families not able to adequately care for them. Although they are certainly disadvantaged, each one of these beautiful boys and girls seems to radiate an aura of serenity rarely observed in the western world's more privileged youth. As the camera follows the kids and the dedicated staff through a typical day - from schoolroom lessons, to playtime, and in charming personal interviews - we also get a sense there is real promise here for all these youngsters. Together they will get through this tough time and emerge fully capable of living complete adult lives. GOD'S LITTLE ANGELS is a remarkable film about hope and love, which transcends its modest ambitions and is a must-see for anyone who cares deeply about the welfare of children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218085</url></doc>
