<plot>Filmed in a variety of exotic and urban locations around the world including the UK, Russia, Australia and Asia the series follows all kinds of animal lovers from top vets to everyday pet owners. Each program is divided into 5 segments full of facts, up-lifting stories and stunning scenery. We follow vets operating on animals in Animal Doctors, we meet the animal lovers who dedicate much of their lives to animals in Animal Helpers and we travel the globe to bring you the people who fight to save endangered animals in Animal World. Like no other program Animal Allies also has a special How To section which gives you essential tips on looking after you own pet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040734</url></doc>
