<plot>The Amazon Rain forest, dubbed "the lungs of the Earth" is the most bio-diverse region on our planet. With each passing day, the industrial contamination grows and its destruction becomes more apparent. KEEPERS OF EDEN, a groundbreaking new documentary, presents the story of the Huarani tribe, who have inhabited the rainforests of Ecuador for thousands of years, who are now in danger of being erased the fallout caused by major oil companies. Historical Media Associates, LLC documents how such oil contamination is causing a fatal blow to both the indigenous people, their culture and the environment. As a result of these "poisoned" living conditions, the native Huarani are suffering from disease on the level of a toxic and fatal plague. All caused by oil contamination. The despoliation, drilling and oil contamination continue to this very day. KEEPERS OF EDEN presents the empassioned struggle of the Huarani people and their fight for survival.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?288962</url></doc>
