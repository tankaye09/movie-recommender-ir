<plot>Meet Jim, owner of a comic book shop and all around nice guy. So what if he hasn't had a date in years and his current major relationship is with a couple of geeks named Nathan and Lewis who spend all day in his shop playing World of Warcraft and re-enacting Star Wars? But Jim's days of mediocrity are at an end. He receives an unusual package from his long estranged father that turns his world upside down - and him into various comic book characters. Not the good ones. Adventure ensues as the bad guy threatens him, the girl he (finally!) gets a date with is kidnapped, and he and his nerd compatriots are left to save the day. Mild Mannered is a single camera comedy pilot from two of the producers behind Martti and Kim's Story of... [Abridged], which won the Best Educational Pilot award at the New York Television Festival 2006.
