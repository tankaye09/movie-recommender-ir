<plot>What are the limits of deceit? A broken man finds salvation in the arms of his best friend's wife, but is she who she says she is? A decrepit business tycoon will do anything to protect his family and his empire. A repentant man cannot escape his past or the secret that threatens to tear his world apart. A scorned lover will stop at nothing to destroy what she once loved. In a world of great wealth and great power, boundaries give way and the lines between truth and lies blur. The people you trust may not be what they say they are. Put your faith in the wrong person and there will be fatal consequences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569256</url></doc>
