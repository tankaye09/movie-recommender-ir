<plot>The entire "You Can Be A Woman..." series focuses on encouraging elementary school-age girls to discover science and exploration, hopefully encouraging them to consider scientific career choices. "Future Girls - Adventures In Marine Biology", is based on the book, "You Can Be A Woman Marine Biologist", by Florence McAlary and Judith Love Cohen. In "Future Girls - Adventures In Marine Biology", two young girls, Rachel and Lisa fall asleep while doing their science homework, and dream they are traveling underwater, exploring the beautiful deep blue sea with Bio Girl, a 22-yr-old marine biologist. Along the way, the girls learn about the sea and its many sea creatures through 3D animation, live action and stunning documentary footage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?207431</url></doc>
