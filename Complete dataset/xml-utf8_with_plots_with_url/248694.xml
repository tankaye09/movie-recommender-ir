<plot>It's hot. You're thirsty. Looks like you need a drink. You have a cup full of a tasty liquid, but how do you get it into your face? Folks spend far too much of their straw opening time cramming the flimsy plastic on a counter. Not only is that method barbaric, but it often leaves the straw cracked and useless. For shame! The time has come for a paradigm shift. Join Casey on a fun and informative journey to learn what it takes to open a straw the right way. Take it from those who have experienced Casey's teachings: you will never look at opening a straw the same way again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248694</url></doc>
