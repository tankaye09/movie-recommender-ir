<plot>Anthropologist Dr Aris Poulianos was born on Ikaria, a small Aegean Sea island in Greece. A fighter from his teens, Dr Poulianos now in his mid '80's brought controversy to Greek scientists by revealing the origins of Greeks and introducing his theory of an alternative model in human evolution. But equally astonishing is his life. A defender of Greek independence during the '40's along with the Liberation and Democratic armies, a refugee in Palestine, biologist in the US, and a PhD anthropologist in Moscow University, Dr Poulianos is no ordinary man. A researcher who spends 40 years of his life dedicated in the study of the Archanthropus of Petralona and the ancestors of the archaic humans in Greece and a man who stands up for his rights and ideas. ONE LIFE IN HISTORY chronicles his life, adventures and personal moments that went deep into his memory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412284</url></doc>
