<plot>Back in the early 20th century, the oil and gas industry was driven by men of almost mythological stature. These were the wildcatters, brave individuals who created an industry and made the Ark-La-Tex one of the most vital and exciting centers of petroleum production in the country. The wildcatters were not only gamblers of a sort, they were also dreamers and visionaries. They had the vision to build an industry out of dirt and mud, heart and spirit, grit and passion, and nerves of steel, often living as wildly as they worked. Dreamers and Gamblers: Spirit of the Pioneer Wildcatters is a fifty minute documentary film highlighting some of the most adventurous and successful of these gamblers and dreamers from Northwest Louisiana. This film is an honor and salute to these men, these pioneers who made their dream a reality, and allow us to live our own dreams, everyday. For the wildcatters - here's to you!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159551</url></doc>
