<plot>It's the first day of autumn and Gibbons can already smell death in the air. Leading us and his dog Woody on a walk through a cemetery, Gibbons voices his obsessive thoughts of death and destruction saying, "I want to be a leaf; I want to fall from a great height and crush whatever I land on." Waxing weirdly philosophical, Gibbons satirically tries to impress the concept of mortality on his dog.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175072</url></doc>
