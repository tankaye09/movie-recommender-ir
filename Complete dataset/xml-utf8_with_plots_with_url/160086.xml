<plot>Drift by Max Hattler sees the body as a metaphorical landscape. Eerie and sometimes too close for comfort the film manages to transform the familiar and mundane into something poetic and mysterious. A narrative grows out of what at first seems like nothing, but by the time the journey is over the viewer is left wanting more. What has happened is uncertain and maybe unimportant. The mood is at the heart of this piece. One part horror film and one part nature study certainly makes for a compelling mix.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160086</url></doc>
