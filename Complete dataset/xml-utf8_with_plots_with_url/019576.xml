<plot>Introducing Skyler, Nick, and Hoser. Three Hollywood outsiders with a dream bigger than their three wits combined. Skyler is a slick young producer in the making, and Nick and Hoser... well, lets just say they're well intentioned. Every star has a different success story. Some sleep their way to the top. Others get discovered on a good hair day serving pizza... Skyler bullshitted the mafia. Being Chicago boys, their options were limited. But a good idea is a good idea - no matter who's mouth it comes from - and Skyler, along with his devoted cohorts, find themselves armed with a suitcase filled to the brim with dead presidents -- courtesy of mafia king pin Frankie Bascanati. But instead of making the movie, they blow all the money on themselves. With all their cash spent away on extravagant accessories like the glimmering Rolex on Sklyer's wrist, even he has to admit, "The leer jet was a little overboard." When their dream of making a film is replaced by the nightmare of the day Frankie comes to collect his film, hope appears in the name of Larry Rubin. One part myth, one part ponytail, this Porsche driving Hollywood player arrives on the scene for a fashionable film premiere. Now the guys must sneak their way into the exclusive event, find Rubin, convince him to fund their film (again), all the while avoiding Frankie's henchmen. To complicate matters Skyler just can't resist seducing a beautiful woman he meets at the premiere party, despite the language barrier.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019576</url></doc>
