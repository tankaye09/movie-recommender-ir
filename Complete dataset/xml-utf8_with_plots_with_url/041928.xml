<plot>Frank awakes in a post-coital embrace with a younger girl, Rose. When she awakes she dresses hurriedly muttering about feeling guilty she walks over to a cupboard and pulls out a camcorder which had been recording the previous night's antics in order to provoke jealousy in her real boyfriend. Rose apologizes and leaves Frank distressed and heartbroken. Through flashbacks we witness Rose and Frank's meeting. Frank scores drugs from his friend Calvin. Frank speaks about his alienation from the world. Calvin hands Frank some tabs of acid which he takes. Feeling guilty Rose smashes the tape of her and Frank. Frank begins to trip hard and with his intense self loathing begins to strangle himself. Out of nowhere he receives a phone call from his own self-conscious who convinces him to take charge of his life. Frank breaks into Rose's house and begins to scream at her before calming, claiming that he will leave if she grants him a goodbye kiss. He takes out a bottle of poison and pours it into his mouth before kissing her, transferring the poison and forcing her to swallow it. The penultimate sequence is narrated by the spirit of Rose which is still hovering in the room watching Frank read through her journal. Throughout Rose's transcendental narration she refers to herself in the plural 'we' and it is only on the last beat of the scene we discover that she lost her virginity to Frank and was pregnant with his baby.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041928</url></doc>
