<plot>Kevin's parents died of AIDS. Now 17, he needs to know how to protect himself. But is told "no matter what, if you find yourself having sex, do not use a condom, but pray to the Lord." Kevin Sumba's parents died of AIDS, leaving him to raise himself alone from the age of 10. Now 17, on the verge of sexual maturity, he needs to know how to protect himself from the disease devastating his community. "Make It Real (to me)" is Kevin's journey, from his small slum in Kenya to the halls of power, to find out how he and the millions of orphans like him can survive the epidemic that Nelson Mandela calls the "human rights issue of our time".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353233</url></doc>
