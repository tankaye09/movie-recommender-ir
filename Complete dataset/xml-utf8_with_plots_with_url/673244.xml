<plot>Atsuma, Makoto, and Toya are students at the Enchanter's University in Yokohama City. At the university, they study to become enchanters, while learning about topics such as the man-made golems that populate the world. Although powerful self-aware golems fought each other and laid waste to the land 1000 years ago during the Golem Wars, golems in the modern era serve mankind. One day, while the three are skipping class to attend a local festival, an apparent earthquake occurs. Additionally, the golems in the area appear to have gone berserk and are now attacking people. Rushing back to the university, the three find that things are in chaos, and that the mysterious sealed ward had been opened. While seeking to discover what has happened, the trio meet up with the Queen of Ice, a golem sealed long ago, and thus begins the main tale of Enchanted Arms.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?673244</url></doc>
