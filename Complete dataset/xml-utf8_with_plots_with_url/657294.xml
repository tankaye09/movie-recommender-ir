<plot>The world Josh and Michael used to know is gone. Their days are filled with endless darkness as they struggle to maintain the will to survive, hopeful that one day the world will be safe enough to walk out the door and again feel the light on their faces. Their window to the outside is Ralph. He is their rescuer. Their protector. Their friend. Ralph describes the world outside as a "hell" that has been visited upon the earth, and that they are safer inside, out of the storm. Josh is certain that he and his brother would not have survived without his aid, and continued protection. Josh and Michael have much to be thankful for. Or so they believe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657294</url></doc>
