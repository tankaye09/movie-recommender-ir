<plot>Hotel Saint Cosmas is an apartment building owned by Dr. Cosmas, called 'saint' by his tenants because of his generosity. All of the tenants live rent-free at the hotel and no one can remember a time when they had to pay. One month ago, his brother mysteriously died in the hotel. Some people say his body never left the premises. Things have started to change at Hotel Saint Cosmas and the tenants are about to discover that nothing is ever really free. Scholar's Mate is the first in a series of stories about the tenants of Hotel Saint Cosmas. This story tells the tale of the King and Queen and a chess game that will determine their fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247115</url></doc>
