<plot>Dario Fo and Franca Rame: a Nobel for Two portrays the life and career of Nobel Prize laureate Dario Fo, a milestone of international theater and literature, and his wife Franca Rame. Dario Fo and Franca Rame, a husband and wife duo of actors and playwrights, are best known for their satirical and politically radical theater. Their work was censored for more than 17 years and they were twice denied U.S. entry visas on political grounds. The documentary shows how the lives and careers of those two playwrights have been dedicated to taking the side of the oppressed and poking fun at the establishment. The film features performance excerpts from classic Dario Fo plays such as Mistero Buffo and The Accidental Death of an Anarchist. Also featured are interviews with Fo and Rame and numerous theatrical colleagues in Italy and abroad, including Robert Brustein and Robert Orchard of the American Repertory Theater.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127041</url></doc>
