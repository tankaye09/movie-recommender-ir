<plot>A suburban white woman finds herself caught between a long walk around a scarry park or helping a young African American girl. Choosing to help the girl, both are confronted by a group of young African American men who, despite their stereotyped look and attitude, offer to walk both through the park to safety. The youths playfully tease and try to impress the young girl who pays them no attention, but the white woman's imagination and fear gets the best of her, causing her to freeze. All but one of the boys leave her and continue, but the one young man confronts her fears and his typecasting by using both humor and respect to not only guide her safely across, but also teach her a valuable lesson in not leaping to judge people and that sometimes, an offer to help is just that.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576322</url></doc>
