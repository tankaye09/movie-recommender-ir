<plot>If you want a film that will enthuse your audience, buy this one. It represents the Philadelphia, Washington &amp; Long Branch Express coming toward you and the Continental Limited receding. It is not alone the fastest train scene thus far produced, but the scenery is the most beautiful and picturesque of any landscape film ever made in life motion. After the first train has passed the audience will witness a hairbreadth escape of a man and a boy, who did not notice the train coming from the opposite direction until it was almost upon them. They were so frightened at the occurence that it took some minutes to recover from the shock. By an unforseen lucky accident, we are enabled to produce a picture that may never again be brought forth in its entirety. If you want a winner for repeated encores, get this one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394193</url></doc>
