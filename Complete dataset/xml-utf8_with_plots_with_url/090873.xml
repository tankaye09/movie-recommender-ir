<plot>A picture of the above named body of men taken at drill. The view was secured in San Francisco, California, through the courtesy of Captain Thomas A. Nerney who was in command of the U.S.S. "Marion" stationed at that port. The picture shows the officers and men drilling with a one-pound Hotchkiss gun, same as that used in the U.S. Navy. The picture is excellent in every detail and shows every movement. The scene is also replete with motion from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090873</url></doc>
