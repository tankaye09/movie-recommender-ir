<plot>In this retelling of the fairy tale, everyone is sexually charged. Little Red ventures through the woods to visit her grandmother, who seduces the wolf when he comes to her house. The wolf and Little Red, grandma and the woodsman, and Little Red's mom and the milkman are just a few of the pairings. The basket of goodies goes ignored.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338431</url></doc>
