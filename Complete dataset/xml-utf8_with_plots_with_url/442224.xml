<plot>The title sequence opens as the earth spins alone in outer space. A small V emerges out of its atmosphere, moving to the left of the screen, increasing in size until it forms the capital letter of the title: VISTAVISION. The screen fades to black, and a moment later it fades in to the bottom half of a woman's face. We see her lips and the shadow of her nose. A beat later, the next title appears just above her mouth: WESTMINSTER ADULT EDUCATION SERVICES PRESENTS: The title dissolves, and we travel up the woman's nose to frame both of her eyes. We freeze frame for a few seconds to allow the third title to appear on her nose: starring A PAIR OF EYES The title dissolves, and then we move to the left eye. We freeze frame for a few seconds once again, and underneath the bottom eyelashes the fourth title appears: and A LEFT EYE in The title and the left eye slowly fades out, and then a closed left eye fades in. The eye opens, and in a freeze frame the fifth title emerges out of the iris. It fills the eye, filling the screen, and then dissolves. We keep the eye in frame because there is something else emerging out of the iris. It is the solar system, and it slowly moves towards us, filling the eye, dominating the screen, dissolving the eye in a cross dissolve. In a swirl of ecstasy, the solar system rotates, spinning around like a spider's web. On the right hand side the sixth title appears: co-starring THE SOLAR SYSTEM The title dissolves, and the solar system continues to swirl slowly in a dizzying display of colours. A moment later, the seventh title appears at the bottom of the screen. The title dissolves, and the swirling solar system enters into a transition. At this point, the eighth title appears at the bottom of the screen. The title dissolves, and then a second solar system begins to swirl in a dizzying ecstasy. The ninth title appears a moment later in the centre of the screen. The solar system now recedes back into the eye, but immediately after we see one more thing emerge out of the iris. It is the last title, and it springs forth filling the screen as the music builds to a crescendo. It is the last image that we see, and both the titles and the eye fades to black.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442224</url></doc>
