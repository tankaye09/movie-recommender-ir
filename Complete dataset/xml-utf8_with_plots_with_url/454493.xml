<plot>Unable to handle the taking of his kingdom by an Indian Government decree, the Maharaja kills himself. His son, Jaipal, takes over as the Maharaja, turns rebel, and refuses to hand over his title and kingdom to the Government. It is in this background that Police Superintendent Dhirendra Singh assumes his duties. When a conflict arises between Jaipal and himself, he is transferred to another town. His father, Thakur Ram Avtaar, wants him to marry a childhood friend, Janki, the daughter of Thakur Pratap Singh. When he meets her, he falls in love with her, not knowing that she has given her heart to Manu Pratap Singh, with whose family there is animosity as Pratap's sister had eloped with a male from their family, &amp; was killed at the hands of Pratap. An enraged Pratap, when he finds out about Janki's affair, has her married to Dhirendra. On the day of the marriage, Jaipal's nephew abducts Janki, but is shot dead by Manu. A pregnant Janki goes to live with Dhirendra, while Manu is sentenced to prison for life. An angry Jaipal kills Manu's dad, Thakur Sangram Singh, and sets fire to their house. Then Jaipal sets his eyes on young Kamli, who is Bhanu Pratap Singh's, Manu's brother, sweetheart, gets her pregnant, but refuses to marry her. Kamli, shamed at this, refuses to meet Bhanu. When Bhanu finds out that Jaipal had killed his dad and set fire to their property, he becomes a bandit with several other townspeople, and calls himself Bhavani. Years later, Manu is released from prison for good conduct, decides to make a living as a bounty hunter, hunting down, killing bandits and collecting rewards from SP Dhirendra. The story reaches a climax when Manu goes to hunt down Bhawani, not knowing that it is his own brother; while Jaipal kidnaps Dhirendra's son and holds him for ransom. The question remains will Manu hunt down Bhanu, and will Dhirendra compromise his position for a child that is not his own?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454493</url></doc>
