<plot>Events of the film take place in both hemispheres. Presidents of countries, bosses of drug cartels, special agents and powerful secret service agencies from all around the world are the first hand participants of its events. The film begins with an account of a shocking yet quite ordinary skirmish - an average drug kin pin is beating one of his assistants with a golf club with a purpose of educating him, because the assistant's cell phone was quite unlawfully confiscated by an overly diligent secret service agent. The mutilated gangster understands the incommensurability of his guilt and the level of his fault, and becomes the first character who asks the question: What do we know about the world we live in? However, he won't have the chance to contemplate on the answer. The agent, who took his property not thinking that a cell phone could be as dangerous as an atomic bomb, will seek an answer to this question. The speed of the following events is equivalent to its entertaining content. Secret codes, solutions, pursuits, new victims... There's no joke to this mystery: its unveiling will destroy all preexisting notions of international politics in the minds of the people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383088</url></doc>
