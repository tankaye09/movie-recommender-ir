<plot>David Arnold and Andrew Sloan are two high school nerdy-outcasts, your typical losers. They've got no game and more importantly, no dates for prom. Just when they are feeling incessantly desperate the boys stumble upon a car full of cash and opt to keep it believing it's the answer to their dilemma; who says money can't buy happiness?! Overnight David and Andrew become "too cool for school" when the new cars, clothes and "Fierce" lifestyle shoot them to top-popularity status, especially with the babes. But alas, their timely fortune is too good to be true as the mafia wants their money back and they're not playing around. The boys now have cops, crooks and mobsters on their tail, all who won't stop at anything until they get their hands on the cash. All this for prom dates!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238978</url></doc>
