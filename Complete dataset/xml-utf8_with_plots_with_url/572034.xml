<plot>The film follows the journey of Michael King as he comes out of the old world of social distancing from his flatmate, Clare Kelly, into the new world of stepping onto the property ladder. He enters the flat where she is watching television in the dining room having been sacked from her job. She appears to have nothing to say to him when he says hello to her because they have very little in common. He continues to observe her whilst he is pouring himself a drink, knowing that they both have too far to go to find common ground. When he enters the kitchen, he is made to feel isolated when she also enters the kitchen, takes a packet of crisps out of her cupboard and turns off the light when she exits leaving him all alone in the darkness. She is not interested in his career advancement simply because her own career is stuck in a rut. He returns back to the dining room in a long scene where he sits next to her and watches television, highlighting the parallel lives that they lead. Clare gets up, switches off the television and begins hoovering the floor whilst Michael is still sitting on the sofa. She packs the vacuum cleaner away, and just as she is about to leave, Michael informs that he is moving out. This takes her by surprise, and she tries to redeem herself by saying that she should have made more of an effort to get to know him. He flashes her a look, and then exits the room, leaving her all alone in the flat. VERY ALONE.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572034</url></doc>
