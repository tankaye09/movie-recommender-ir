<plot>Paolo walks with his small female dog Giuseppina through those places where he met the women of his life. This is the beginning of memories of the stories he had with these 'fimmine'(females): sweet and romantic Katia, disappointed by Paolo's indifference, ardent and passionate Regina suffocated by his too many attentions, independent and strong Cinzia whom preferred a mobile phone to him! Paolo's mother advices put his chaotic universe in order. But this is not the end: even the other 'fimmina', the little dog Giuseppina, will reserve a coup de théâtre.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?194628</url></doc>
