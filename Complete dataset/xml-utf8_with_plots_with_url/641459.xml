<plot>Police Inspector Shekar is assigned the case of apprehending people behind the drug cartel and smuggling. After an investigation, he finds out that the brains behind this is Badrinath Pandey, a politician who has strong ties with gangsters. Shekar arrests him, and holds him in prison to be tried for a variety of criminal offences. This is when Shekar finds out that justice works differently for people like Pandey, and as a result Pandey is released from prison, without being charged, and Shekar is suspended. Now without his uniform, Shekar and his family become targets of Pandey, the police, and the gangsters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641459</url></doc>
