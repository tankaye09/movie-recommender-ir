<plot>"On Saturday morning, August 20, 1898, six grim battleships of Admiral Sampson's Squadron sailed into New York Harbor and up the Hudson to receive a welcome from the people and to fire a salute of victory in sight of the tomb of the great soldier-hero of another war [Ulysses Grant]. We present the following films to the public as our share in the celebration, by means of which we not only satisfy the curiosity of people living too far distant to be present, but also perpetuate forever the glory of the occasion. The only vessel of the seven that looks as if she had been fighting. Rusty looking patches on her water line. Good, clear, close view."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?537817</url></doc>
