<plot>Selvam (Murali) is indebted to Devarajan (Satyaraj) who saves his mother's life. Devarajan is the village hotshot, and Selvam is his goon for a variety of illegal activities. A new inspector Peter (Sarath Babu) is posted to the village, who immediately crosses swords with Devarajan and Selvam. Selvam falls in love with Peter's sister, a situation that Devarajan plans to use to his advantage. The film isn't that bad if you put aside the director's subsequent work, and both Satyaraj and Murali do fairly well in their roles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420229</url></doc>
