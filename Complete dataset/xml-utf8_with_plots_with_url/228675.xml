<plot>Like most people Lettie took her lifestyle for granted, until her destiny was forever changed. Not yet ready to embrace her situation she feels helpless and doesn't want to let go of the past. At the fields' parking lot to watch her brother play baseball, the last handicapped parking space taken by someone late to her dance class, who has yet to learn that lesson.
