<plot>The Ark is a huge spaceship that is bearing the surviving cultures of a long-dead Earth. The cultures live in 50 mile wide Domes and are mostly ignorant of each others' existence. The three principal characters accidentally escape from their Medieval peasant environ, discover that the Ark's crew is long dead and the ship is adrift. They wander through the ship and its domes, seeking help to regain control of the ship and humanity's destiny. The original Starlost TV series was broadcast by CTV in 1973. In 1980, a set of 5 60-minute compilation movies were released. This one was made from two episodes guest-starring Walter Koenig as the alien Oro who seeks to gain control of the massive Ark for his own race.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?593013</url></doc>
