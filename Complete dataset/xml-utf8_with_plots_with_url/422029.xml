<plot>Who has not heard of Multnomah Falls, the most interesting point along the Columbia River, occupying a fern lined gorge of marvelous beauty. They are 850 feet high, and when the heavy mountain snows are converted into water by the early summer sun, they bear a worthy companion to the famous falls of Yosemite Valley. The channel at the very summit is only thirty feet wide, but the water spreads out in the first leap it makes (800 feet) and after pausing for an instant in a foam lashed pool, a further drop of fifty feet is made in its final descent. Through the courtesy of the O. R. &amp; N. R'y, our photographer obtained a view of these beautiful falls, such as has never been taken before, in fact as a motion picture it has never been equaled. It is so perfect that in looking at it when projected upon the screen it seems Stereoscopic, something heretofore never produced in a motion picture. No exhibitor looking for a panoramic scene can be without this grand film. Words cannot describe it; it must be seen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422029</url></doc>
