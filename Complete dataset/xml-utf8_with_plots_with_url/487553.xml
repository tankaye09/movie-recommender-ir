<plot>Being a little over 18 miles from the continent is both a godsend and a curse. Over the centuries, trade with Europe has been easy, unfortunately with proximity brings the threat of invasion. The buildings and landscapes of Southern Britain reflect thousands of years of conflict and it's the French that have left the biggest mark....both in our architecture....and our psyche. Chris Packham explores the Seven Man-made Wonders of The South aboard a 150 year old sailing ship, a bicycle, a narrow boat and a New Forest Pony.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?487553</url></doc>
