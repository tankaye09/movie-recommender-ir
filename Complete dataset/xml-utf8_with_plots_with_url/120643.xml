<plot>"A group of escaped reconcentrados, saved from the fate of starvation imposed by the Butcher, Weyler. They stand in line waiting, each man with his tin dish and cup. One expects to see just such men as these, after the centuries of Spanish oppression and tyranny. As they come forward, their walk is listless and lifeless. The picture affords an exceedingly interesting character study. At one side stands a group of officers from the camp near by, accompanying several ladies who are seeing the sights."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?120643</url></doc>
