<plot>A tramp knocks at the door of a farm house and asks for something to eat. The woman who answers the call hands him something which evidently does not suit him and he throws it on the ground. In anger he seizes some sweetmeats which the cook has placed on the table outside to cool. The cook now appears and calling the dog hisses him on to the tramp. The dog seizes him by the bosom of his trousers, and while he tries to avoid the dog, the cook empties a pan of flour on his head. Funny, and full of life and action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550154</url></doc>
