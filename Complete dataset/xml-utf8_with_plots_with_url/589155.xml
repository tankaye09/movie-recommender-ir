<plot>The Searching Generation is a documentary about two generations: Generation X and Milennials. The filmmakers explore the same questions among twenty-somethings of Europe and the U.S., as well as among experts in spirituality, art, film and music. Included are interviews with best-selling authors Erwin McManus, Brian McLaren, Lauren Winner, screenwriter Craig Detweiler, musician Derek Webb, producer Mark Joseph. Among the questions explored are: What is important to these generations? How do they shape their values? How are they misunderstood? How do they describe themselves? What role does spirituality, art and music play in their lives?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589155</url></doc>
