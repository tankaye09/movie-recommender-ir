<plot>Harvey's Speech is the retrospective story of an aging die-hard businessman whose talents in a company he helped build and protect are no longer required. Harvey Gilbert is being forced into retirement. He has spent his entire life working for a company that has become overrun with young up-starts who are convinced they have a clue, but don't. In an attempt to be gracious, the company is throwing a farewell banquet in Harvey's honor. Harvey decides that his best chance to tell the higher ups to stick it where the sun doesn't shine will be in his acceptance speech.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231176</url></doc>
