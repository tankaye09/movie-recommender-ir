<plot>Completed just months after 9/11/01 and, given that time period's interesting climate, of solidarity among Americans, this found footage film explores how the idea of being "American" really hasn't changed over the years. Sure, the symbols have changed, the causes are different, but the fundamental idea of what it is to be American has remained solid throughout. Using high school educational films, toy and cigarette commercials, and anything else one could find on film from the 40s through the 60s, this patchwork film shows how the masters of the medium could just as easily sell us our identities inside a Pepsi bottle or a children's toy, as they can with the American flag or a "United We Stand" bumper sticker. What does it REALLY mean to be a father or mother, son or daughter, dutiful American? Where do we find ourselves?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035178</url></doc>
