<plot>Madman is a post-modernist reimagining of the Frankenstein tale, with a superhero twist. The title character, killed in a car accident, is reanimated by an eccentric doc who names him Frank Einstein and instills in him enhanced senses, psychic power and exceptional physical skills. The doc can't fix his creature's face, so Madman wears a costume modeled after his fave superhero to hide his scars.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351228</url></doc>
