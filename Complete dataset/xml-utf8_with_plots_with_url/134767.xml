<plot>A story of compassion and extraordinary dedication towards abused and neglected wild animals. The film takes a close look at the Wildlife Waystation, an animal rescue station and refuge which is home for approximately 1100 animals from Siberian Tigers to birds. It is a tribute to those who care (founder Martine Colette and her dedicated staff). But it also sheds light at horrible practices around the world that make a place like the waystation so necessary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134767</url></doc>
