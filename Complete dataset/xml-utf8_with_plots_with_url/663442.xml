<plot>Inspector Shanker Verma is an honest and dedicated Police Inspector, who has been serving on the police force for many years. He lives with his mom, and a brother, Jai. Shankar was in love with Shashi, but the affair did not last, leaving him with a broken heart. Jai, on the other hand, is percocious, and always in trouble. This precociousness lands him in a soup when he is unable to explain as to why he robbed a bank and a killed a person.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663442</url></doc>
