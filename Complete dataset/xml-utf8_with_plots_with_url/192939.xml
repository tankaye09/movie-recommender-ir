<plot>The Benidorm Song Contest is the most popular contest of songs in Spain. Although the first edition was in 1959, that edition was not broadcasted on TV. The first edition that could be seen on TV was the second one in 1960. Anyway, in 1975 TV didn't either broadcast the show. The previous year was the last one broadcasted in black and white, and the following year would be the first one in colour. In 1979 there was no festival at all, live or on TV. In 1984 the festival dissapeared. It came back in 1985 as a different thing with no contest, just a music festival. After that, it dissapeared again and took eight years to come back, in 1993, broadcasted by a private channel after some rehearsals live in 1992. It came back to the national channel around 1997 or 1998, can't remember now. The last edition of 2004 was the first one with international artists competing to win. The winner was a british man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192939</url></doc>
