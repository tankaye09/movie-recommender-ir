<plot>A boy throws his ball up, and it disappears. He thinks it has become the sun, and he takes ever more extreme measures, ultimately climbing onto a passing jet, to reach it. Finally, he climbs onto a magic horse; they pass through many constellations. As they are flying, an evil black sun blots out the real sun; they organize the other stars, vanquish the evil black sun, and are sent back on a sea of balls and given a hero's welcome.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152824</url></doc>
