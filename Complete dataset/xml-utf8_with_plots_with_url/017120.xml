<plot>Lemmy is headed westward on a greyhound bus, away from his previous life in New Orleans - his travels fueled by one of FEMA's recent check payouts for approximately 834,000 hurricane victims. Salvaging his guitar and a backpack, he also carries with him a half-realized dream of re-igniting his musical career. On the bus he encounters young, outgoing Darlene, who is also headed west to live with her distant relatives after the death of her grandmother. As the two travelers advance further from their pasts and into the unknown, Darlene attempts to pull Lemmy out of his quietness and into her world of possibilities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017120</url></doc>
