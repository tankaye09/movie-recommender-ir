<plot>Ths entry in RKO's two-reel "Pal" series features Ted Donaldson (from Columbia's "Rusty" series), Sharyn Moffett and Flame the Wonder Dog (as "Pal", and also "Rusty" in the Columbia feature series.) This is not the same Flame, the Wonder Dog that hung out with David Sharpe in a mid-1930's series of shorts produced by William Berke. This one has some thieves stealing a valuable shephard dog from some kennels and a puppy follows them and gets lost. Ted finds and adopts the dog and said dog soon grows up and Ted's uncle orders him to get rid of the dog. Instead, Ted and the dog run away...well, Ted runs away and Pal follows...and they meet young Sharyn and Pal saves her dog from a dangerous situation. Ted Donaldson, out-growing the role, was later replaced by Billy Gray and the series went on for a few more years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384678</url></doc>
