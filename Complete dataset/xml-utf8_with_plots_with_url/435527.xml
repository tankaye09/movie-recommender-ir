<plot>Dromio (24), a piano prodigy from birth, has been home-educated by his beautiful, single mother Marion (46). As they move into a tight-knit rural community on the coast of Suffolk, Marion seeks to draw her awkward son out of his shell by simultaneously playing on his sexual devotion to her whilst thrusting him into the path of an infatuated local girl, Tabitha (19). Marion's attempts to attach herself to Colin, a married aspiring Casanova, serve to raise Dromio's newly-awakened desires to boiling-point, sweeping all four characters up along with them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435527</url></doc>
