<plot>A documentary to to examine the excessive waste in today's culture - an experiment in trash. Two people rent an unfurnished apartment, bringing with them only the clothes they were wearing and a flashlight. They decided not to buy any items for 3 months and instead, adopt a "freegan" lifestyle. All food, clothes, furniture and everything else was found discarded and perfectly fine in the trash. Many other scavengers were also identified, ranging from students to doctors to artists. It seems "dumpster diving" is more common place than was first thought.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252792</url></doc>
