<plot>The scene is laid in the garden, and the pet of the family, a huge great Dane, is performing tricks before his prospective purchaser. The bargain is finally made, the money paid over and the dog delivered. His former owner starts off without him. The dog evidently does not like his new home and starts in pursuit of his master, pulling the purchaser over on his face and dragging him for a great distance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485426</url></doc>
