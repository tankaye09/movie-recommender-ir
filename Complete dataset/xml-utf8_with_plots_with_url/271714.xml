<plot>Police Inspector Jai lives a middle-class life with his mother and physically and mentally challenged brother, Sunder. One day he arrests a man named Pandey, and after questioning him, finds out that the person behind this crime was a man named Guman Singh. He gets on the trail of Guman Singh, arrests him, and holds him in a cell. Then a series of explosions create havoc in the city, with the assailants demanding the unconditional release of Guman. With the police having no clue as to the assailants whereabouts or where they are going to strike next, they release Guman. They threaten Jai with dire consequences, forcing Jai to resign from his job. Hoping that he and his family are safe, Jai starts to re-build his life, along with his sweetheart, Sharmila. Then tragedy strikes, his mother is killed in an accident, and his brother is abducted by Jagtap Singh and Guman, who demand that he return a bag containing their valuables. Jai is willing to do anything to get back his brother, but how can negotiate when he does not even have the bag in his possession?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271714</url></doc>
