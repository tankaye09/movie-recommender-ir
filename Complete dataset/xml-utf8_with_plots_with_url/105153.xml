<plot>Hans Von Bulow stated, "He who cannot read between the lines, who does not possess a certain quantum of ingenuity, who brings with him no fantasy himself, remains a respectable distance from Bach's 'Chromatic Fantasy'." World-class violist, Rozanna, enters an empty stage and plays the 'Chromatic Fantasy.' She grows more and more intimate with the music, her environment slowly leaves her, as she slips deep into her mind. In her fantasy, Rozanna, clutching her silent white viola, pursues her musical Red self from a courtyard and to a garden. Finally, in the forest, Rozanna in White finds her Red self and approaches to the final, passionate measures. White creeps closer and closer to her Red self, and, summoning up the courage, plays the final, conclusive note.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?105153</url></doc>
