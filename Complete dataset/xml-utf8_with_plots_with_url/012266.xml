<plot>Offering a singular take on the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, 'A Letter to the Prime Minister' follows Jo Wilding on her remarkable journey of the last few years, in solidarity with the people of Iraq. Narrated as a letter to Tony Blair and using original diary extracts, from her challenging of the legality of the devastating economic sanctions imposed on the country, through to her activities in Baghdad before and during the 2003 Invasion, the film traces the non-violent resistance to US/UK policy in the region. Wilding serves as witness to the destruction of the lives of ordinary people during the bombing campaign and their subsequent neglect by Occupation forces and the interim authorities but she also acts, forming the Boomchucka Circus to work with school children and refugees. In April 2004, that help extended to traveling into Falluja, when even Al Jazeera had pulled out, to stand alongside the civilians trapped and targeted by US forces. Exclusive footage from the besieged city of Falluja creates a moving picture of the terrible impact UK &amp; US foreign policy has had on ordinary Iraqi people, while the film itself stands as a powerful act of remembrance and questions an unjust and damaging Occupation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012266</url></doc>
