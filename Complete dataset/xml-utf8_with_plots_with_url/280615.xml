<plot>This is the story of Christine, a young non-Jew German, daughter of a Protestant family, who immigrates to Israel. After several years living in Israel, she still feels like an outsider, bearing the "Mark of Cain", because of her foreign origin. Despite her numerous attempts to immerse herself in all aspects of society, Christine continues to run into a "glass wall". Able to see through to the other side, all too often she experiences the unspoken taboos of an "outsider" coming from different roots. She realized one of her dreams and converted to Judaism, but even after that she found that Israelis would still not fully accept her, and that reality is not like a dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280615</url></doc>
