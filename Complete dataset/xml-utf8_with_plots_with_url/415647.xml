<plot>When Barry Levinson wrote the movie Diner, he created characters based on a composite of various guys he hung out with at the local diner. The Original Diner Guys documentary follows the lives of the actual "diner guys". Filmed from 1990 to 1997, it captures the relationships, the humorous ribbing and interactions that have bonded this group for nearly a lifetime. The film follows the guys through reunions, celebrations and the realization of their own mortality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415647</url></doc>
