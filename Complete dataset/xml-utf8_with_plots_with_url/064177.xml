<plot>Martin Symons was born with two rare conditions: Klippel Feil Syndrome and a Lust for Life. Klippel Feil is host of disabilities but with Martin's attitude to life there is little that has stopped him doing what he wants to do. However his body is weakening and this year he decided to attempt his final challenge: a coast to coast ride along the Hadrian's Wall cycle route in an off-road wheelchair whilst being kept alive on a ventilator. The film captures a year of his life in an uplifting and inspiring tale of one man's daily battle to live life to the full.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064177</url></doc>
