<plot>Roosevelt Prophet is a one-time big city cop turned private investigator. In his new calling he has acquired the most impressive moniker of "Ballbuster". The thugs that he comes in contact with as the action unfolds, discover that it's a name that is well-earned. The Number One thug "Ballbuster" must contend with is Nick Plato, who's into everything from loan sharking to gambling. Plato's gambling affairs have gotten a bit out of hand and he now owes other seedy characters upwards of US$2 million. As a result Plato must put the squeeze on some of his own clients. Wouldn't you know it, this is when "Ballbuster" gets in his way. A pretty, reclusive, and alcoholic fine artist, lives in the building that Plato owns; she sees a woman get killed. She thinks it's Plato's seductive wife and she reports it to the police. Of course when no body turns up, the police begin to think the artist is suffering from alcohol induced hallucinations. But, she hires "Ballbuster" to get to the bottom of it all, and he does. But not before the artist gets kidnapped; he has a shoot-out with Plato's gunmen, including Plato's especially sadistic henchmen Hacksaw and Paycheck at an auto graveyard; has another altercation with Plato's group of hired mercenaries while trying to rescue the girl; and ends up having hand-to-hand combat with them. And what of Plato? How does this end?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057678</url></doc>
