<plot>Recorded and aired live by ABC-TV on 6th April 1974 at the Ontario Speedway near Los Angeles CA. Video produced by Tony Edwards. One of the most controversial rock festivals of the seventies had to be the 'California Jam-Festival, which included E.L.P, Black Sabbath, Eagles, Rare Earth and of course the headliner: Deep Purple. 200,000 visitors witnessed the havoc caused when, during the performance, Ritchie Blackmore started to destroy ABC's tv cameras! The track "Lay down, stay down" was also done but was later edited off by some strange reason. The concert was subsequently released on CD in 1996.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?466070</url></doc>
