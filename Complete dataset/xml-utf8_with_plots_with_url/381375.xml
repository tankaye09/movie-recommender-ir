<plot>Young filmmaker Kyle Mumford had always looked up to his father Chris. For many years Kyle had been given a wonderful life from his father but realized he had known nothing about his father, Chris, before he was born. When He had asked his father about his past, his father responded, 'Only when your twenty five'. But going through troubles of his own, Kyle realized his fathers truth was something he needed to know. Something that could help him. Kyle Mumford goes on a personal journey of finding out the truth of his father's and families story of a loving family turned into a dark and dysfunctional one.
