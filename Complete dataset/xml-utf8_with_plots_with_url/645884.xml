<plot>A self-absorbed young man, Geoffery Sherman, is obsessed with solitude and the control it gives him. Following the news of his mother's death, an antagonistic paperboy challenges Geoffery to face his fear of the outside world. His security is disrupted and Geoffery's relationship with his wife spins out of control. After losing command over his wife, Geoffery finds sanctuary in a passive mistress. Taking an aggressively dynamic turn, the women in his world become impossible to placate and Geoffery's world spirals into a darkly comedic scenario of internal conflict.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?645884</url></doc>
