<plot>Eric Smith and Pascal Destandeau of Pugs Leap Farm are a gay couple who gave up their successful corporate life in San Francisco after becoming disillusioned with the rat race, and their ultimate decision to move to the country and lead a more self-sustaining life. They now run a successful goat dairy and make spectacular artisan goat cheese. The film tells the story of their life-changing decision and inspiring partnership, weaving in the very current issues of slow food and living locally, modern farming and sustainable business.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327759</url></doc>
