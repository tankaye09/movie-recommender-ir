<plot>Christina Aguilera's breathlessly energetic, senses-frazzling live spectacular of a concert brought the house down in Sydney Adelaide, Australia; and the cameras were there to capture it all in both cities for the release of her Back To Basics - Live Down Under concert. The critically acclaimed live extravaganza thrills and awes, while Christina's vocal acrobatics remind you why hers is the Voice of a Generation. With ninety minutes of footage - from burlesque cabaret, to trapeze choreography, fire jugglers and stilt walkers - the Lady knows how to put on what's been called "the greatest show on earth!" The live concert features eighteen songs, spanning Christina's career, including the hits "Ain't No Other Man", "Candyman", "Dirrty", "Come On Over", "What A Girl Wants", "Hurt", "Fighter" and of course the Grammy-winning smash hit "Beautiful". Oh Mother, the fifth single of Back To Basics, is used to promote. The German music channel VIVA had released a live video of Oh Mother, live from the Back To Basics Tour. Additionally RCA Records sent the live video of Dirrty to Yahoo Videos, where it got premiered on February 4th, and Ain't No Other Man was sent to the channel VH1.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104825</url></doc>
