<plot>Vijay lives a wealthy lifestyle with his widowed dad, Mohan, and is betrothed to Gayetri Prasad when they were still children. Now both are adults and are attracted to each other. Gayetri, who lives a middle-class lifestyle with her dad, Badri, and mom, Satyavati, in Madhavpur, is soon married to Vijay, but realizes that he is an atheist, while she is a devout Hindu, and worshiper of Lord Shiv, and it was perhaps for this reason that their marriage ceremony was marred by several accidents, including Vijay being mauled by a runaway buffalo, and a fire breaking out at the Mandap itself. On their wedding night, Gayetri is subjected to more shock and trauma as she gets to witness a different Vijay, someone who is lusty, and much more eager to have his way with her, than make love to her. The rest of the family also find out, have Vijay examined by a doctor, who prescribes some rest, and then a discharge. However, Vijay relapses, leaving the family no alternative but to call in a Tantrik, Bajrangi Baba, as they fear he may be possessed by a demon. Gayetri and the rest of the family will soon find out that Vijay is indeed possessed by Kamini, a girl who he allegedly romanced during his college days in a hostel, but refused to marry, leading to her death. Now Kamini is back with a vengeance - and a vow to destroy this marriage at any and all costs - even if it means killing both Gayetri and Vijay - and there is no power on Earth that can stop her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356092</url></doc>
