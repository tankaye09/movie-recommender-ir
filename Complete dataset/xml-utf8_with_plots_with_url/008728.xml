<plot>Ex-detective Joanne Kilbourn now works as a university lecturer and a "law and order" commentator for the local news. She is reminded of the reason why she left the force when the six-year-old case file on her husband's murder is reopened and a suspect, Kevin Tarpley, is arrested. Kevin denies being the killer but does seem to have insider information about Ian's death; unfortunately, Kevin is gunned down in the street soon after his arrest. When Joanne is confronted by Kevin's mysterious wife, Maureen Gault, at a party in front of all of Ian's old politician friends, she begins investigating. Soon, she finds herself the chief suspect in a murder, and she also discovers that Ian's old friends aren't exactly friends to her. This film is the fourth in a series featuring Joanne Kilbourn; it resolves the murder of her husband and her longstanding flirtatious relationship with her ex-partner, Millard.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008728</url></doc>
