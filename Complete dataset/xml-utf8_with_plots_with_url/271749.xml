She is assigned as a public prosecutor to ensure that accused, Rajesh Srivastav, gets hanged for homicide. She succeeds, but in order to teach Rajesh a lesson. She decides to give him a sum of five lakhs rupees to provide for his blind mother and unmarried sister. Thereafter he will have to marry her, and spend the rest of his life following her instructions until she fulfils the conditions of her parents' will and inherit a vast estate and fortune. Rajesh has no choice but to agree. The marriage takes place, and Rajesh starts showing his true colours, getting drunk and abusive.
