<plot>'Ubuntu: The Street Child Story' is a heartfelt film documenting the plight of street children in urban Africa. Raw and authentic in its message, all the stakeholders, including the children themselves, share their stories. Matt Nelson, the film's young director, spent 3 months in southern Africa living with street children in 2007. Working with a small NGO based in Zambia, Eagles Wings, Matt documented their lives in order to share their stories and raise awareness of their plight. To get an overall picture of the situation they traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, interviewing various Government ministers and heads of major NGOs, including UNICEF and World Vision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624430</url></doc>
