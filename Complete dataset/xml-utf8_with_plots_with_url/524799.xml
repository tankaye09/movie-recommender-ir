<plot>He's 28 years old. After high school, he went backpacking in Europe. He ended up in Sweden. He married a Swedish woman in order to stay in the country. He got a job with American Airlines, taking international ticket orders over the telephone. Because of his new occupation, he gets free flights all over the world. Na√Øve and unmotivated, our character quickly turns to a fake, jet-set bohemian lifestyle. After September 11th he is laid off from his job. His relationship falls through. With time to kill, free American Airlines flights for another year and a constant supply of Swedish social security cheques, he travels around the world. Our character develops an addiction to his way of life. We meet our character at a major turning point. His benefits have run out. His makeshift life is collapsing. His world is a suitcase and an addiction he can no longer support. What will he do? Who will he turn to for help? "Sweden on $8 a day" was shot in Toronto, Canada during a weekend in February 2004 on a budget of less than $100.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?524799</url></doc>
