<plot>When the water mysteriously stops, a man is forced out of his daily routine to examine his life. He revisits his past to consider the places and moments that shaped him. But in a constantly shifting world, these memories have lost the meaning they once had. Have the places changed or has he? What can these places tell him now - and do they always say the same thing? It's time to pack a bag and head for higher ground.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206579</url></doc>
