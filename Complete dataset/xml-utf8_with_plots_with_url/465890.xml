<plot>Rocco at Cedarmere, filmed cinema verite', at the historical home of William Cullen Bryant, goes way beyond the scope of a party leading into a fantastic once in a lifetime concert/event given by the host, Long Island's own Rocco, musician-filmmaker. With the personal candid interviews given on the spot by fans and friends, along with the captured conversations of the audience, a story begins to take shape that is both heartwarming and inspirational between Rocco and his friend and protege Mark, who is mentally handicapped - who also gives the performance of a lifetime.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465890</url></doc>
