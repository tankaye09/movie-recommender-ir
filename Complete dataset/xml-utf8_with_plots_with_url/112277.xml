<plot>He's tough, he's bald, he's British, and he's the guy police departments across America call when they have a new threat to tackle. This is Paul Castle, whose unorthodox training techniques - including everything from humor to humiliation - prepare local police officers for dangerous work. Paul goes to a new police department to help officers with a special challenge, whether it's bringing down meth dealers or kidnappers. Viewers will see how the officers change under Paul's tutelage - especially the weakest one, who will be profiled - and then watch the cops handle a highly realistic mock mission, or possibly a real raid.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112277</url></doc>
