<plot>In another bout of brillant filmmaking Bill has once again completed his annual film in the month between Burning Man and the Santa Cruz Burning Man Film Festival. The final film in the Aqua Burn trilogy celebrates the Vault of Heaven theme of 2004. Having evolved into a serene and meditative incarnation, Astro Blaze maintains the magic and imagination that went into it's predecessors. Beautiful and moving music underscore this collaberation of art, earth and people. Time lapses so beautiful they could have only been shot in a sand storm. Interviews with regulars and newbies alike.
