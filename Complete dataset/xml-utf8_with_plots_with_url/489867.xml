<plot>Two brothers, Robert and John, are after the same girl, who eventually picks Robert. Robert, however, soon goes blind, and she turns to brother John for help. He is willing to help her, if she is willing to "help" him, and she refuses. Enraged, he attacks her. She is saved by the intervention of his clerk, Harry, but in the struggle between the two men, she takes money off of John's desk. Arrested for the theft, Harry is convicted and sent to prison; although John soon finds out it was Agnes who actually took the money, he says nothing and allows Harry to stay imprisoned for a crime he now knows the man didn't commit. Complications ensue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?489867</url></doc>
