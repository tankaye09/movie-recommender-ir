<plot>A frozen lake, a fishing hut, a bloodied up body, a case full of money - this is the scene that a solitary fisherman stumbles upon while out on what was supposed to be a quiet day of ice fishing. After realizing that the man, who has been shot in the stomach, is still alive, the fisherman decides to try to help him, but with the closest hospital over two hours away by car, all he can really do is offer him company during his last moments. As the dying man awakens and tries to explain what happened, the fisherman cuts him off, stating that he'd rather not get any more involved than he already is. But the man, on his last breaths, is determined to reveal his story and has to find a more creative way to get through to his forthright companion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083906</url></doc>
