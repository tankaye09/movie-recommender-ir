<plot>Lost Bones details the life and death of Lakota leader Sitting Bull and the stories that surround his burial and final resting place. Some say he is still buried at an old US army fort in North Dakota, the site of his first official burial. Others are adamant his Earthly remains were moved by Ghouls to Mobridge, South Dakota in April of 1953... and now another theory has surfaced. Sitting Bull's body was spirited away - shortly after his death - and taken to the Turtle Mountains of Manitoba. Through interviews with Elders, Experts, Historians and dramatic reenactments Lost Bones attempts to solve the mystery of where Sitting Bulls bones lie today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343509</url></doc>
