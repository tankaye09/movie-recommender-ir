<plot>Sledhead is a documentary about a remarkable team and even more remarkable men. It's the story about Team Canada's Sledge Hockey Team and their quest to become the World Champion. It's a gripping doc, an up-close look at this tough sport - the players battle their opponents with bone-breaking intensity, on the ice in titanium sleds, striving to score with unrelenting intensity. It's also about men from a wide variety of backgrounds, with amazing stories to tell. For all, it's little wonder they are determined to win at all costs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?501227</url></doc>
