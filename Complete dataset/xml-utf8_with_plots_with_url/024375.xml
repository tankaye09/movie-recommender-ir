<plot>Advice to Adventurous Girls is an experimental portrait of Lillian La France (1894 -1979), a Kansas farm girl who ran away with a traveling carnival and went on to become a world renowned motorcycle daredevil on her Wall of Death. Optically printed, hand processed, color, black and white and negative images, as well as Lillian's home movies recreate the filmmaker's journey as a hired detective who ultimately uncovers an unanswerable question: How does a person recover lost faith in herself?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024375</url></doc>
