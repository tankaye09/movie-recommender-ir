<plot>In 1916 by German scientists made an 80-second audio recording of a Sikh soldier captured at the Battle of Flanders during WWI. The starving soldier, Mal Singh, yearns to return to his home in the Punjab, the "land of butter and milk." Retired Indian Colonel Perminder Randhawa reflects on Mal Singh's fate, and locates his descendants still living in his old village, and still hoping to receive his long-forgotten pension.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584139</url></doc>
