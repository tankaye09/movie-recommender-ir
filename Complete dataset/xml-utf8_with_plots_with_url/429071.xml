<plot>Three recently-married couples competed in "Perfect Match," another in the long line of "Newlywed Game" clones and variants. In round one, the wives were secluded offstage while their husbands were asked a series of (usually provocative) questions posed by host Goen ("You're sitting down watching TV, the doorbell rings and it's your wife's boss. You answer it, but the only problem is, your naked. How do you explain the situation to your wife's boss?") Correct matches were worth $50. In a similarly-played round 2, the wives were asked the questions while the husbands were taken offstage. In the final round, the couples had to complete two "love notes" (one each for the husband and wife) by filling in the blanks with the words each believed their spouse used. The highest scoring couple of the day won a $1,000 bonus; if every word matched in both notes, the bonus was raised to $5,000.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429071</url></doc>
