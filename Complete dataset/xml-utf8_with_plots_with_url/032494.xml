<plot>Five solo sailors, pitting their skills against the elements in "Around Alone" trans-global sailboat races, are profiled as they struggle against the most challenging moments of their careers. From Isabelle Autissier, whose boat does a deadly 360 degree barrel roll before capsizing, to Viktor Yazikov who has to perform surgery on himself, these sailors typify both the adventure and the psyche of those who would sail the seven seas alone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032494</url></doc>
