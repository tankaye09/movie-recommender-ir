<plot>Major Nick Reed is an intrepid analyst for Army Intelligence. It's his job to locate a secret enemy base whose fighters - the dreaded Ghost Squadron - attack our bombers. Complicating his efforts is a chance meeting with his former love, Lt. Monica Tasty, and her current beau, Major Mitch Dunning. Can Reed find the fighter base in time for the 4th Armoured to attack? Will the Nazi learn our next target and send the Ghost Squadron to attack our bombers? Why do some women fall for the bad boys, completely ignoring the good responsible men right in front of them? Learn the answers in 'At War With Intelligence.'</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?369965</url></doc>
