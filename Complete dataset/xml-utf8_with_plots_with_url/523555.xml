<plot>Survivalist Les Stroud places himself in unique survival situations. In each challenge he demonstrates how one might survive alone in a remote location with minimal supplies until being rescued. Finding food, water, and materials to make fire and shelter pose the main challenge of each episode. Les not only needs to survive for a week with no supplies, but he must film everything himself, dragging 50 pounds of camera gear and batteries every inch of the way. Armed with a unique one-person camera rig and an abundance of wry humor, Les documents his struggles to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles in climates as diverse as the Costa Rican rainforest, Georgia swampland, high Sonoran desert and Arctic ice floes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523555</url></doc>
