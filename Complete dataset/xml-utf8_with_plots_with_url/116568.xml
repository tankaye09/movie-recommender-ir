<plot>The Council of Europe in Strasburg, France, is seen through the sometimes mischievious eyes of its fleet of simultaneous interpreters. The behind-the-scenes intrigues contrast amusingly with the serious pronouncements by Robert Schuman (France), Prime Minister de Gaspardi (Italy) and Chancellor Adenauer (Germany), who declare their intention to form the European Coal and Steel Community. France's Paul Reynaud, Germany's von Brentano and Britain's Robert Boothby speak during a session on European unity. This glimpse into the Council's early days - when it had only advisory functions - takes on historic significance as the Continent moves toward making it a European Parliament.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?116568</url></doc>
