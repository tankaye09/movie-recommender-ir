<plot>Bridget is having a cup of coffee in Vancouver's Stanley Park with a man in an overcoat approaches and asks if he can take her photograph. She's flattered and says yes. He brings her into focus, then pulls open his coat to expose himself - he snaps a picture of her look. Later, at home, she hears a couple making love in a nearby apartment, and when her boyfriend gets home, she invites erotic fantasy play. Soon after, she goes in search of the photographer, with a plan of her own. What can be captured on film, and what does fantasy unlock?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093884</url></doc>
