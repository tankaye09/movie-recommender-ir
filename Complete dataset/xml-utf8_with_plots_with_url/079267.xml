<plot>For socially active, pop culture seekers who want a more interactive television experience, the half-hour MOVING STORIES TV series provides a unique lens through which to view books, by adapting the work of contemporary authors into provocative short films. Award-winning, multi-talented artist of film, TV, books and music, host PAUL QUARRINGTON sets up each episode, pointing out things of particular interest to someone who is a film buff, aspires to make a film, is curious about what goes on behind the scenes in filmmaking, wants to know more about the author, the book, and more, according to the nature of that episode's content. MOVING STORIES is filmic storytelling directly linked to today's culture. We believe that literacy motivates people to celebrate our collective stories. MOVING STORIES encourages anybody who has the desire and vision to become "literate" in film, books and community.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079267</url></doc>
