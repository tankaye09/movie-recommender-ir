<plot>Rancher William Norton (Edward LeSaint) refuses to sell his cattle for half price, so saloon owner and gang leader Jim Fletcher (Dick Curtis), contrary to the orders from his secret boss Willard McGowan (Robert Warwick), the town banker, has his men rob and beat up Norton. Unknown to anyone, Marion (Iris Meredith), McGowan's adopted daughter is really the daughter of Norton, who disappeared as a young baby when she and her mother were passengers on a stagecoach held up by McGowan. Chuck Saunders (Charles Starrett), Norton's foreman, goes after the gang for robbing his boss and eventually uncovers the truth regarding Marion's heritage. In addition to Bob Nolan,"Sons of the Pioneers" Tim Spencer, Lloyd Perryman, Pat Brady, Hugh and Karl Farr are along as Norton ranch hands, and the uncredited Blackie Whiteford and Ernie Adams also appear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321663</url></doc>
