<plot>This is another scene somewhat similar to the last two, but showing instead the Woodmen of America, also justly celebrated for the accuracy and completeness of their drills and uniforms. A very brilliant film, full of motion and highly successful wherever exhibited.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?189084</url></doc>
