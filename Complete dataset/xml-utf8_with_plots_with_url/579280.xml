<plot>America's favorite young married couple, Nick Lachey &amp; Jessica Simpson, multi-platinum artists known from their hit MTV series, "Newlyweds," star in their first-ever television special, featuring a fun-filled variety hour of music and comedy. In a throwback to the days of Sonny &amp; Cher and Laugh-In, the beloved Nick &amp; Jessica breathe new life into the variety format, showcasing their singing and comedic talents in a series of sketches and musical performances with such guests as Jewel, Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Kenny Rogers, baseball Hall of Fame star Johnny Bench, Mr. T, and The Muppets stars Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. The musical performances include a duet with Jessica and Jewel, who sings her classic song, "Who Will Save Your Soul," and a duet with Nick and Babyface singing the Stevie Wonder classic, "For Once in My Life." Jessica also performed "Islands in the Stream" with the legendary Kenny Rogers. Comedy sketches include a hilarious skit with Mr. T, and Jessica and Nick dropping in on Kermit and Miss Piggy, who are taping their own variety show on the same stage. Also, Nick's hometown hero, Cincinnati Reds Hall of Famer Johnny Bench, drops in to teach Jessica how to hit like a pro. Jessica also performed her new hit single, "Take My Breath Away," which she introduced as the first song the couple kissed to. The show premiered on Easter Sunday, April 11, 2004 and was ranked by Neilsen as the 17th highest rated show of the week.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579280</url></doc>
