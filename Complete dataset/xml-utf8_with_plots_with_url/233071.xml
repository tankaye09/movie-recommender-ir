<plot>A young girl finds out the reason why she isn't popular and doesn't get invited to many parties is because of her posture--she slouches a lot. However, by a fortuitous coincidence, a doctor who is a specialist at posture just happens to give a lecture to her science class. She resolves to improve her posture so she can be popular and people will invite her to parties, where she can have fun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233071</url></doc>
