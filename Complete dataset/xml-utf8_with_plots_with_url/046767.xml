<plot>The story of two sisters coping in different ways with the same affliction: social anxiety disorder. Laradene, chooses to use her anxiety to fuel her artwork. Her sister Stephanie chooses to use the medication that is so heavily advertised on T.V. through out the story. Stephanie is failing at work, and is given the ultimatum to "find the biggest loser in the world and make her look like a movie star for 15 seconds." Stephanie sees the ultimate "magic makeover" opportunity in her reclusive sister. Lara does not take well to the medication as it depletes her of her creativity that allows her to paint, and when she discontinues her medication, she is in no shape for the camera. In the climactic confrontation between the two sisters, their tenuous bond will be broken.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046767</url></doc>
