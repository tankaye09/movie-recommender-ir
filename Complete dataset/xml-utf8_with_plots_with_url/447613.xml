<plot>Profiles six competitors in the 2004 Annual Whistler's Convention, held in Louisburg, North Carolina. We hear them whistle, and they and others talk about whistling as a way to relax, cheer up, entertain, express emotion, and enjoy life. Each talks about how others see their hobby. Joe is older, competing after a ten years break. Chris uses interesting sounds to spice up his performances. Graham stays with the melody, as does Sandra. Steve is smooth, a multi-year champion. Geert is new, having come with his wife from the Netherlands for the competition. First the prelims, then the finals. Clips from films illustrate the qualities of whistling.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?447613</url></doc>
