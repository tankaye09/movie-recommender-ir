<plot>Everyday life is very demanding - quite often we feel overburdened by modern society. We are especially over-strained, when we can't change situations in which we are stuck. There is no moving forward nor backward - a compulsory break that should be used for relaxation ... This film and the entire soundtrack were created in only 36 hours as part of the Instant 36 film challenge 2006, which had the motto "somebody seems to have pressed the pause button".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?051827</url></doc>
