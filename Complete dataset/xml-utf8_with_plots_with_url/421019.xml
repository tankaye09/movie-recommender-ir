<plot>Ravi (Rajesh Khanna) accidentally lands a job as postman in a remote village after being an unemployed college graduate for some Time. He meets a variety of people as he fits into rural life, including Mohini (Hema Malini). He mistakes her affection for something more, and falls in love, while she is still waiting for a somewhat philandering Army officer with whom she has had a fling with when his battalion is training near her village. Ravi withdraws into himself when he finds out about her fling, and tries to help her locate her love when war breaks out. He brings her news of her lover's death, and there are misunderstandings which cause anguish ... eventually leading to a compromise and a happy ending. A couple of lilting melodies from Rahul Dev Burman compliment this film ... Allah megh de, Dakhiya Dakh Laya, and Koi mere mathe pe bindiya .... it is somewhat of an extension of Khushboo, with some of the theatrical roles reversed. Sarat Chandra Chatterjee was known for poignancy in his works which included the ever famous Devdas, and Sampooran Singh Gulzar does a pretty decent job of carrying that same torch over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421019</url></doc>
