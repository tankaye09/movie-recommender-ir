<plot>This is a singularly beautiful and effective picture; just about perfect in every respect. A handsome young woman in evening dress is preparing a welsh rabbit at a chafing dish. She mixes the various ingredients, allows them to cook and then, lifting the cover, brings forth a cunning and kicking rabbit, which she proceeds to fondle with great glee. The picture must be seen to be appreciated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018152</url></doc>
