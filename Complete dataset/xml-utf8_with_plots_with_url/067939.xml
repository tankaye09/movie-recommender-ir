<plot>Geeta (Meena Kumari) is married to Shyam (Balraj Sahni) but is unable to bear children. She also looks after her younger brother-in-law, Mohan (Sailesh Kumar). Their happy family gets an addition in the form of Prabha (Seema Deo) who gets married to Mohan. Prabha is from a wealthy family and her life is ruled over by her dominating mom (Durga Khote). Misunderstandings arise to such an extent that Prabha moves out of her home, and back to her mom's. She gives birth to a baby, and not even her husband comes to visit her or to see the baby. Will things change or get worse for these people?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067939</url></doc>
