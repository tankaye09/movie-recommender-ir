<plot>This film was taken at the great Chicago encampment of the G.A.R., 1901. All agree that outside of the veterans themselves no point of interest compared to the grand Court of Honor extending for one mile. A special permit was obtained, the street was cleared and our artist succeeded in obtaining, from a rapidly moving automobile, a panorama of the entire Court on both sides of the street, presenting a picture of unsurpassed beauty, and one which will be of interest in G.A.R. circles to the end of time. This is the only picture in existence of the entire Court of Honor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?480013</url></doc>
