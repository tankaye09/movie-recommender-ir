<plot>Marie grew up in a satanic cult. Pauletta's daughter was shot by her boyfriend. Christine was abused by her father. Kim's husband beat her. Shannon's father set the house on fire. The personal stories in Run, Jane, Run were created in a digital storytelling workshop for survivors of domestic violence. Alternately disturbing, shocking, enlightening, and encouraging, the stories reveal the determination of the women to survive, move on and thrive. Original music and animation complement home movie footage and personal photographs as each woman narrates her story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470559</url></doc>
