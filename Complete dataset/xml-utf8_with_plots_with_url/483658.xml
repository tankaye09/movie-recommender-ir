<plot>RICHARD KINGSTON, remorseful billionaire, announces that his successor will be Theodore Kingston whose name no one heard of. Leaving furious family, Rich comes to 'Kingston' hospital where Dr. Ray grows Theo who is Rich's clone: Rich is about to transplant his brain into Theo's head and he'll live as Theo for another century. But Rich gets nervous because it is social suicide as well as physical rebirth. As Rich sympathizes with Theo, identity disorder becomes him, which makes Rich hurry transplant to satisfy his unlimited desire in this young body. Ray warns him of this danger. Meanwhile, Nathan, his first son, visits the hospital, leaving Rich a warning that family won't accept him.
