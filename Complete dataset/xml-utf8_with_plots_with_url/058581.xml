<plot>When Paul, a career soldier, is discharged from the Army, he sets off for Southeast Asia in search of his long lost MIA father. Quickly adrift in the seductive, unfamiliar landscape of modern day Asia, he's targeted by a Bible-toting pickpocket and the two men strike an uneasy friendship. They set off for Cambodia to find where Paul's father was shot down some thirty years before. Along the way, a pain-in-the-ass post-grad from Wisconsin latches onto them, and the three men follow a hilarious trail of adventure that ends in unexpected pleasure and pain, and proves you're never too old to come of age.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058581</url></doc>
