<plot>Have you ever enjoyed your work...really enjoyed your work? If you haven't, then you must see and meet "The Dancers". Jackie (John Leslie), road manager of the dancers know as "The Dreams", takes his entourage to the small town of Key City. The guys are booked at the wild North Point Salooon, owned by the luscious Maxie Roget (Kay Parker) and the action begins. As always, before show time the mood becomes restless and tense, so Maxie coaxes Jackie into getting a "quick bite" to calm him down. Meanwhile, dancers Jonathan, Joey and Sebastian (Richard Pacheco, Joey Silvera and Randy West respectively) offset their eagerness by meeting and seducing beautiful women. Georgina Spelvin (as Catherine) gives her best performance since "The Devil in Miss Jones". Spectacularly featured in possibly her most volcanic-action ever is the lustful Vanessa Del Rio, whose anal and oral escapades have to be seen to be believed. Also featured is luscious newcomer Anna Turner as Sherri, the town nymph. "The Dancers" generates some of the most erotic heat ever displayed in an adult feature.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?551701</url></doc>
