<plot>Het is zo fijn om Surinamer te zijn is a documentary in which Surinamese youngsters try to help developing their country with spreading their message of positivity and inspiration: stay in school, be a positive citizen. Their group is called the Dim Sum Academy and together with filmmaker In-Soo Radstake they make a documentary about their journey. Initially it's not sure what they exactly do, until the moment a preview screening is held in Paramaribo. After that they start touring with the film, an journey in which even the president comes in to the story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?237741</url></doc>
