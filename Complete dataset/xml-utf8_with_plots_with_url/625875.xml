<plot>Rwanda was destroyed by the 4 year war waged from 1990 to 1994 and the genocide that followed it. In 1994, in a space of a hundred days, almost a million people were murdered. The release in August 2005 of those who participated in the genocide has made it possible to follow the trail of survivors and executioners since that 1994 until our days through the labyrinth of reconciliation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?625875</url></doc>
