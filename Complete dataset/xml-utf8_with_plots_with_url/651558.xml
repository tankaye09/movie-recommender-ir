<plot>An off-screen narrator relates a story told at a home in the Hollywood Hills during a storm. A screenwriter named Basil tells of a Hollywood screenwriter named John Dough, who wakes up after a late-night party and rushes off to the studio. However, a few interruptions, including thinking for a moment that he sees a woman's body in his bed, having his car key not work, and thinking he hears his mother calling, make him almost a minute late. When tragedy happens, he revisits the day's events. A phone call from his brother in Chicago confirms how odd this morning is. Did he experience telepathy or was it all coincidence? If radio waves can carry a communication, why not a mother's love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651558</url></doc>
