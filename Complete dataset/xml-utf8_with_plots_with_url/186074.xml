<plot>One of the most puzzling of the entire magic picture series. An old Hindoo conjurer appears upon the stage and causes an armed knight to perform puzzling and wonderful tricks, such as changing vases and other inanimate objects into animate form. Then, by a single wave of the hand, the entire setting is changed and the knight finds himself in a dungeon with many witches dancing about him. He is in a frantic state of mind, when the conjurer suddenly appears and by another magic pass presents the knight with a beautiful bride. The dancing witches are at the same time changed into bridesmaids, forming a most pleasing ending to the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186074</url></doc>
