<plot>The film tells the story of what happens, when a teenage girl is moved from her usual environment - where family, friends and emotions are her highest priority - to a military milieu where she is put in a uniform and mutual orders and hierarchical structures of authority fill the day. The girls in uniform experience a very different transition from teenage girl to women, than that of other girls in the Western world. The film explores the consequences a teenage girl faces when going through this kind of transition in uniform. She is a soldier, but she is first and foremost a teenage girl who has to discover her individualism and her own way in life. This individualism has to be developed in a military world, which does not place that kind of concept at the top of its list of priorities. The film is interested in exploring how this girl tries to become a young woman - with her own sense of values, feelings, ambitions and sexuality - and how she goes on this journey wearing a uniform and taking orders from others. "Avishag" is a film about the two-sided life, which this girl goes trough during her two years of military service. It is a film that allows the girl to tell her own story and share her own feelings about her experiences in this military period of her life - and doing so in an honest and beautiful way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052700</url></doc>
