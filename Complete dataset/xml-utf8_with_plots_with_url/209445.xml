<plot>Determined to discover her life purpose, for nine months a young woman courageously and authentically holds the camera and films herself and her world, in this raw and honest search for meaning, clarity, direction and Truth. On a quest, much like any mythical one, this modern-day young woman sets out to examine her life at its authentic core. In addition to impromptu interviews, the film depicts unrehearsed and often, uncomfortably candid glimpses into her struggles with love, money, direction and God. Imbued throughout with organic, spontaneous humor mixed with raw, emotional expression, Gandhi and Lipgloss unpredictably challenges the viewer to lift their personal veils and examine the essence of their own lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209445</url></doc>
