<plot>Tired of a monotonous and passionless marriage, Carlo decides it's time to move on. Saying goodbye is never easy, so he perpetuates a facade of love, while wishing that his wife, Mary, would stop loving him. Mary is determined to make their relationship work. Domestic politics get thrown into uncharted territory after mysterious events call into question the very nature of their love. A bracing look at the point where unconditional love and deceitfulness meet - not to mention mafia hit-men, Mexican soap-stars, and seam-stressing.</plot><plot>Tired of a monotonous and passionless marriage, Carlo decides it's time to move on.
