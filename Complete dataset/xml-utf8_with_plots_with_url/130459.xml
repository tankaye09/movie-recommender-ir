<plot>In a strange and disturbing world, Kwesi, a fearless humanoid gangster, is forced to settle a large debt that he has with the leader of the mutant mafia, Ian Demone. Before fleeing the city, Kwesi, in order to pay off his debt, is given a contract to exterminate one of Demone's henchmen, Sonny Londa, a small time rogue mafia boss. It is in this setting of perverse decadence that Kwesi discovers the mysterious and colorful nightclub 'Dawm'. And with him he brings Myaranda, a high-class prostitute, who decides to leave everything behind to follow him in his adventure. And thus begins the puzzle-like story set in an unreal world that basculates between dreams and reality. Kwesi must find the door that leads out of the labyrinth of this obscure world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130459</url></doc>
