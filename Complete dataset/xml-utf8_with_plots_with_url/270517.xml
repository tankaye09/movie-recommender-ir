<plot>What is war? What is history? To a scientist, it isn't enough just to be an onlooker on history - through the eyes of media - and with selected material. He created a formula with which he is able to create his own reality, a parallel universe, which is following the rules of his creator. There, the scientist is able to castigate mankind in his deadliest form. Made out of Found Footage-Material, Bela Lugosi makes a comeback - mounted out of his material as divine master of ceremonies. Surrounded by archive materials of war broadcast news and so part of a new universe. Linchpin is mankind's potential of violence and the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270517</url></doc>
