<plot>The cat of the house has his nap interrupted when two puppies, playing with a balloon, hit him with it. He chases the pups, crashing into vases and the like. He sneaks off in time for the puppies to get blamed and thrown outside. But the gate isn't latched solidly; they get outside and it latches behind them. They run away from the dogcatcher and start exploring another dog's yard until the big mean looking (but chained up) bulldog chases them off. They get him wrap his chain around a tree while they make off with his bone, and it's a race now with some other dogs, the dogcatcher, the bulldog (now dragging his house) all chasing and traffic crashing every which way. The parade runs into a dog show, then out, with all the dogs chasing. Time passes, into the evening, and people on the home front are getting worried. The cat starts exploring and finds a dog fight at the city dump, where dozens of dogs have the pups cornered. The cat takes them all on and leads the pups home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600282</url></doc>
