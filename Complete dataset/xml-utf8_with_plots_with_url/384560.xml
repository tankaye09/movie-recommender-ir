<plot>Mission for Orphans presents a touching, up-close-and-personal account of the plight of street kids and orphans in Mumbai, India and grassroots efforts to rescue them. Gene Rumley, an American businessman, visits Mumbai to document the work of Biju Thampy, an Indian humanitarian worker, and to assist Biju in his tireless mission to feed, clothe, and educate street children. "My Name is Orphan" is a life-changing West meets East journey that evidences how seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome when people come together for a noble cause.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384560</url></doc>
