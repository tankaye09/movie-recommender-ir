<plot>"A pretty young girl, chaperoned by her elderly father, is seated on a park bench. The old man is bent over his newspaper. The young girl's lover appears on the scene and takes the opposite end of the bench. The two young people attempt to exchange a kiss behind the old man's back, but overturn the bench, throwing all three sprawling on the grass."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037299</url></doc>
