<plot>This 1948 musical short, reissued on September 9, 1954, has no connection to a 1949 U-I short also called "Ted Weems and His Orchestra", other than Ted Weems. This one features the Weems band playing their hit-parade song "Heartaches", while band singer Shirley Richards does "When You're Singing With a Band", and ends with a trio singing "She's Too Fat For Me", the you-can-have-her-I-don't-want-her song.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606207</url></doc>
