<plot>Here we depict a German soldier who has just received a box of Christmas delicacies from home. He opens the box and carefully removes the contents, several bottles of wine, pies, cakes, cookies of all descriptions; but the climax is reached when his favorite dish comes into view--a huge bologna sausage. The facial expressions here introduced are comical. Ignoring the wine, cakes and other delicacies, he settles himself back comfortably and partakes of his favorite sausage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009962</url></doc>
