<plot>It's the year 1999. The future of the United States of Canada is at stake, and Bruce Wong has just been promoted to Vice President of IBS, Canada's largest television network, at the expense of his co-worker Malcolm McEnzie. When revenge backfires on McEnzie, he's changed into the whiny, evil, and un-funny Catatonic Clown. Bruce Wong must take on his secret identity as the crime-fighting Johnny Wong in order to stop the Clown and his android henchman Mobus from turning the world into foam rubber on the eve of the New Year!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278801</url></doc>
