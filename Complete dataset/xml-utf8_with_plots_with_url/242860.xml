<plot>Inspired by the quote from St. Francis of Assisi, "you are what you are seeking," Steinberger set out to document her observations and those of the contemporary traveler. Shot in the mythic cities of Jerusalem, Florence and Las Vegas, Holi-days reveals a subtle contradiction between the modern pilgrims' anticipated expectations and their actual experiences. What we seek can be as profound as a religious epiphany, as superficial as a successful shopping spree, or as life changing as winning the big jackpot.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?242860</url></doc>
