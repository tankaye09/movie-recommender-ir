<plot>Mohanlal comes from a rich family. His parents and his brother and sister are all modern. But Mohanal grew up eccentric and likes different things in life. He follows the teaching of Gandhi. He took a degree, and when a job opportunity came to be a postal inspector in a rural village , he jumps at the chance, at the disapproval of his parents to go work there. There he meets a village girl who lives next door and they fall in love. Problems happen when there two cultures clash, as the girl wants to become modern, while Mohanlal wants to continue to live the simplistic village life style.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?285078</url></doc>
