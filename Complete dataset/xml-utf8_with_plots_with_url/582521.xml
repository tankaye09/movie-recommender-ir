<plot>The scene is in a photographic studio. The photographer has just posed an old farmer for his picture, and goes into the dark room for his plate. While he is away, mischievous small boys throw some giant firecrackers into the camera. They explode and wreck the studio. The action is very humorous throughout.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582521</url></doc>
