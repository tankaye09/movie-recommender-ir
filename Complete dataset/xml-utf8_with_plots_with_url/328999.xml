<plot>"Lejonjakten" is one of five films (three of which are now lost) that were made by students at the University of Lund, Sweden, as a part of their 1908 carnival. The film is a cruel parody on Danish producer Ole Olsen's "LÃ¸vejagten" (1907) which was at the time banned in Denmark (due to the fact that a lion and other animals were actually killed in the film) but shown in Sweden. In the student version two actors dressed up as a lion and a kangaroo get shot by hunters, but the hunters themselves soon get arrested by the police, an allusion to a recent conflict between the students and the local police.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328999</url></doc>
