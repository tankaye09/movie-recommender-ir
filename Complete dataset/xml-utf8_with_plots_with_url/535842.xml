<plot>Terminal is a contemporary tale about our busy and sometimes, lonely lives. Terminal brings a fresh and unique perspective of our daily struggle to make personal "connections" with the rest of the world. Malcolm, flowers in hand, is waiting at the airport bar for his girlfriend's flight and he is about to meet someone who will change his life forever... Jordan, a charming girl, spots Malcolm as he enters the bar and decides she wants to meet him. Through her quirky personality and shoot-from-the-hip conversation she draws out a reluctant and stone-cold Malcolm, making him uncover his hidden feelings about love, his girlfriend, and what it means to be true to oneself. Malcolm faces a decision that may change his life forever: Will he wait for his girlfriend and continue with his predictable but empty life? Or, will he leave the airport with the irresistible Jordan? Terminal was written by fast-rising Hollywood screenwriter Rock Shaink Jr. (The Seed, Hitman U, Alter Ego) and produced and directed by Fernando Beltran y Puga. Terminal will hit the festival circuit in 2007.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?535842</url></doc>
