For the next few years, Jack tried to drown his sorrows in the bottle. His brother's a private investigator, when he got killed while on a case, Jack tried to find his killer and did. He would then take over his brother's (private eye) business. Working with him is Johnny Betts, a young man who worked with his brother. And his main contact on the police force is Lt.
