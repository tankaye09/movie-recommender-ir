<plot>This film chronicles DeLorean's rise and fall, starting with his work as a young exec VP at General Motors, where he developed the Pontiac GTO and Firebird, and the creation of his own company and the DeLorean DMC-12 car - later featured in the "Back to the Future" films. DeLorean's downfall came when he was arrested in 1982 on charges of drug trafficking to help his faltering auto company. He was freed two years later after a court ruled he was a victim of government entrapment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?132731</url></doc>
