<plot>This surrealistic short film takes place in a dream-like saloon somewhere in the limbo of the southwest. A silent observer meets the embodiment of decay and is witness to art, lust, and murder condensed into this single animated happening. Characters include a legless bartender, a fingerless piano player, and a waitress who is not what she seems. The event centers around the appearance of the ghost of John Glanton, who lusts after a waitress whose affections belong to a local piano player. Watching the event unfold is The Kid, a silent observer who will come to understand the underlying depravity of human interaction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292467</url></doc>
