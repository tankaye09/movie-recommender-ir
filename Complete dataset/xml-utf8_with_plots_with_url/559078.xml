<plot>Travelling through the countryside, the fox rests alongside a tree for his picnic. A nearby crow, however, tries to steal his food but is discovered by the fox and given a hotfoot. Reading from "Eslop's Fables" that foxes love grapes, he offers a vine of grapes to the fox but only if he will give up his picnic lunch in exchange for them. The fox figures he can just get them himself. First, he tries jumping but naturally misses. Next, he tries pole vaulting but crash lands. Then, he tries propelling himself on a teeter-board with a rock but it lands on his head. Finally, he tries using a tree/catapault which thrashes him from side to side. At this point, the fox admits defeat and gives the crow his lunch only to be shouted, "SUCKER!!" In the end, however, the fox finally is able to get the grapes only to discover they are "SOUR GRAPES!!!"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?559078</url></doc>
