<plot>The story of three individuals trying to make it together in a world that makes no sense. Lyrical, passionate, and enigmatic, Barriers is a study of what happens to relationships when there is nothing else left to rely upon. Craig is an uptight worker who never has time to spend with his girlfriend Ally. The only time he has to spend is at work with his friend Sam. But what happens when the time that Craig so faithfully holds on to disappears and he is only left with the harsh reality of life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060133</url></doc>
