<plot>In front of the camera, the face of the poet Jorge Calvetti (Jujuy, Argentina, 1916-2002) is shown serene, worthy, deepened by the signs of the life. It says: "to Return to Quebrada of Humahuaca is a way to say I returned seeking landscapes, seeking my house, those houses of province that ships of the time seem. ..I returned to a place where the light and the mountains permit a sensitive man to think that when arrives the hour of the twilight inclines toward the shadow the scale of the world ". Since its department in the Federal Capital of Argentina, evokes, in a loaded motionless trip of images and words, its births, its land, its people, a private way to see the world: "I maintained provided that the reality rests in the mystery". By the evocation, the spaces and the times are broken. The story proposes a to go and to come constant among Calvetti and the "images saved" in its remembrances, among its humanity and its poetic vision of the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?172599</url></doc>
