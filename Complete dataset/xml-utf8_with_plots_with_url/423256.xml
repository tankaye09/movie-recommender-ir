<plot>Savitri (Moushumi Chatterjee) falls in love with Vijay (Mithun Chakraborty), who saves her sister from a dacait named Shamshera (Amrish Puri). Both get very intimate, and then decide to marry. Before the marriage could take place, Shamshera kills Vijay, and Savitri gives birth to a baby boy, but is told that the child was born dead. She then marries Thakur Prem Singh (Navin Nischal), who is responsible for blinding Shamshera in one eye, and sending him to prison. Subsequently Savitri gives birth to another baby boy, Rajesh (Sumit Saigal). Years later, she comes across a young man named Ravi (also Mithun Chakraborty), and is shocked to see the resemblance between him and her former lover. She finds out that Ravi is her son, but decides not to tell her husband. Prem Singh subsequently finds out about this, and decides that Savitiri cannot live under his roof, and so Savitri moves out with Ravi. In the meantime, Rajesh has fallen in bad company, and fights with his dad and Ravi. His dad finds out that Rajesh had tried to kill Ravi, and has his arrested. Rajesh then comes under the influence of Shamshera, who is finally out of prison, and bent on avenging his injury. He intends to use Rajesh against his dad, and then sit back and watch the family destroy each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423256</url></doc>
