<plot>A young denizen of the future world is about to transition to adulthood. Donning an enchanted, ceremonial cape, he soars to the sky. Technology is often trumped by nature, and a cloudless sky yields a bolt of lightning. Our hero falls to Earth. No longer the cradle of life, Earth is a desolate, angry place - a purgatory inhabited by unfortunate souls in transition. Struggle as he may for a glimmer of hope, in the end, salvation is only a dream from which he does not wake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093356</url></doc>
