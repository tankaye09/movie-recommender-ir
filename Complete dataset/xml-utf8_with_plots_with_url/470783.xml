<plot>"We overtake a freight train as we approach the tunnel. The track curves and we see a cavern in the hillside. An eyewink and we're in the tunnel. As we become accustomed to the gloom, we see an EYE far ahead; a half-closed eye, growing larger and large as we approach. It glistens on the converging rails; it grows larger; it grows brighter. We see a delicate picture outlined in that tiny space; a picture of a station, a tower, bright trees, shining meadows; and suddenly we're right in the midst of those tree-clad slopes which make famous the scenery along the Pennsylvania Railroad."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470783</url></doc>
