<plot>Episode 4 - "Predator Island" Across from Miami, Florida lies Bimini Lagoon where a unique shark nursery provides the charismatic and eccentric Dr. Sam Gruber with an ideal environment to study the behavior of immature Lemon Sharks. Dr. Gruber's methods are somewhat unorthodox as he hosts the annual Lemon Shark tagging program. Although more like a shark rodeo-round-up, it afforded both scientists and the Quest team plenty of action in the pursuit of science. Other species of the shark family (elasmobranch - sharks, skates and rays) were also studied at close quarters here and enabled the Quest team to get up close and personal with some very feisty and dangerous Eagle Rays. The Bimini backdrop also permitted the "Shark Doc" to introduce his students to his very practical, hands-on way of teaching; the entire class went shark diving without a cage!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024333</url></doc>
