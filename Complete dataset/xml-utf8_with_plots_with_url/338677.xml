<plot>With Hong Kong on the brink of unification with the Mainland, can they get along? When the Beijing police want to arrest his brother for murder, Hong Kong lawyer Shen goes to Beijing to help. Time and again he butts heads with differences between Hong Kong and Mainland law and practice. Thanks to a persistent though traditional lawyer named Wu and an implacable but fair policewoman named Lan, Shen manages to keep out of jail and pursue his brother's innocence. The big problem is that the dead man, a pimp and a bully, is the son of a wealthy and influential man who'll stop at nothing to avenge his son's death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338677</url></doc>
