<plot>A country town gets excited because of a bank robbery - eight million levs have been stolen from the local bank. A sensational piece of news jolts a small provincial town out of his lethargy. It is the chance of the lifetime of Inspector Tyuhchev. He arrives at scene of the crime and the inquest gets underway with such professionalism that even Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot would have envied him. He has the opportunity to show real professionalism, to make a brilliant display before his fellow-townsmen. Who is the thief? The cashier, the bank manager, the cabaret singer, the French teacher or, God forbid, the mayor himself? Yet, the methods of Inspector are more or less ridiculous, rather than efficient. After a series of funny and unexpected twists and turns, the Inspector tracks down the thief, who turns out to be none other than Doctor Velizar Kardushev, his landlord, whom the Inspector had all along taken into his confidence. All the time the millions had been stashed under the mattress of the Inspector's bed. So far, so good! But suddenly the new arrives that Kardushev's father has in meantime become a minister in the capital. At this point the Inspector faces a new trial: what to do with Kardushev, since he can take advantage of the cushy job in the capital which he can obtain with the assistance of the thief's father? And is it possible to become a hero with a minister's son as a robber?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078558</url></doc>
