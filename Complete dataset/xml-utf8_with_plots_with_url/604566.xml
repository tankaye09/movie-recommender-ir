<plot>In any other profession, Carl Pope might be considered a "company man." He has worked loyally and tirelessly in the name of the Sierra Club for thirty years, running the organization-the largest of its kind in the country-since 1992. Van Jones has founded several organizations within the last decade, including The Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and Green For All. They both live in the Bay Area. They both care intensely about saving the environment. The thing is, they use very distinct methods, although the lines differentiating those methods are blurring as we race further into the 21st century. From the environment to the economy, from old fashioned door-to-door fliers to streaming Internet video, Pope and Jones discuss the myriad elements effecting our lives today and the many possible solutions that are nearly within reach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604566</url></doc>
