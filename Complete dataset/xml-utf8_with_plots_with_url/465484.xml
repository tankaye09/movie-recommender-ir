<plot>Few contemporary comedians African-American or otherwise have influenced and inspired as many as the late Robin Harris, and in this release featuring never-before-seen stand up footage and interviews with a variety of celebrities and comics, comedy lovers who may not have had the opportunity to see Harris perform live can finally find out what all the fuss is about. No one could crack them up like Harris, and there were few venues in which the comedian felt more at home than at The World Famous Comedy Act Theater in Los Angeles. As Harris takes the stage of The World Famous Comedy Act Theater to tell a series of hilarious tales and toy playfully with the willing crowd, the cameras are rolling to capture a moment in time where the laughter never stops.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465484</url></doc>
