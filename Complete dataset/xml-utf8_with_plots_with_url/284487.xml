<plot>Raja has been brought up without a mother, as she had abandoned him long ago. When Raja sees Pooja for the first time, he believes she is his mother. His guardian and aunt, Durga, and her brother, Murli, permit Pooja to be employed as his nanny. Pooja gets to meet Ravi there and both fall in love. This does not auger well with Durga, as she wants him to marry multi-millionaire and U.S. settled heiress, Pinky Khanna. At the first available opportunity, she has Pooja thrown out of the house. The question remains, will Ravi agree to marry Pinky, or will be able to persist against the domineering Durga.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284487</url></doc>
