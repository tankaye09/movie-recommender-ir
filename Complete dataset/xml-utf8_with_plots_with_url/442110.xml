<plot>Each year, millions of babies around the world are born premature. Some die just moments after birth; others continue to vie for strength and health. Some will lose, some will win - but all must fight for life. Preemies: The Fight for Life takes the viewer to the very heart of their battle for survival: the Neo -Natal Intensive Care Unit. Doctors struggle to keep preemies' fragile lungs from collapsing, performing critical operations on infants weighing less than two pounds. Helpless, parents watch and wait, never knowing if their child will ever come home. Candid Interviews. On-scene video as the action unfolds. Preemies: The Fight for Life is a gripping and unforgettable look into the lives of premature babies, their families, and the professionals who fight to keep them alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442110</url></doc>
