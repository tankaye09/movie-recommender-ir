<plot>A number of boys are seen playing in the street. They are playing a game among themselves, when a tramp comes along and stops to look on. They suggest that he take a hand, and the object is to place a funnel in the waistband of his trousers and throwing the head back, place a penny on the forehead and bring the head forward quickly, dropping the penny in the funnel. The tramp attempts this two or three times and finally the last time he makes the attempt one of the boys pours a pitcher of water in the funnel, and you can draw your own conclusions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596770</url></doc>
