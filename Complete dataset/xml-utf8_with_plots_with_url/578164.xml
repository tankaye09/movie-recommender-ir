<plot>When Edward, a despised billionaire, is found dead at his own party, everyone is a suspect. Did the wife kill him because she found out he was having an affair? No. She couldn't hurt anyone... other than the help. Did the son do it for control of the family company? Did the radical activist daughter kill her father to make the world a better place? Maybe the mistress did it after she learned that the new will left everything to her. Perhaps Edward's best friend and business partner killed him because he needed money. Nah. Dead men give no loans. To solve the case and catch the killer, the police send in Pete Monday - the greatest detective in Connecticut (except Hartford). Pete's a hard-boiled cop who talks tough and drinks tougher. In keeping with tradition, Pete gathers the suspects together in the drawing room and asks them questions he already knows the answers to. It takes a serious person with a quick mind to solve a case like this. But, that guy called in sick.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578164</url></doc>
