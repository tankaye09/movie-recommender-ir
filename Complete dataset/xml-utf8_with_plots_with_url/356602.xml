<plot>This picture will make you roar with laughter. Two men are enjoying themselves by throwing an apparent dummy about the room. The figure is that of a woman. No one would believe that the dummy is alive, nor will they believe it until they see this film. After she is thrown about in a manner warranted to kill any living person, she suddenly comes to life and knocks down both of her persecutors. An exceedingly good and lively picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356602</url></doc>
