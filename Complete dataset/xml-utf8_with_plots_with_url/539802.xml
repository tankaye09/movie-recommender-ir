<plot>The experience of a woman forced into facing the dark reality of her soul. Surrounded by the walls of her subconscious, she focuses on the only light she can see, an open window that allows her to ignore the darkness that engulfs her. As her world becomes louder and more chaotic, she can no longer sit in ignorance and is thrown into the torment of knowledge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?539802</url></doc>
