<plot>Kent Fishman is a germophobe who spends the weekdays pushing a pencil at his tidy desk while his employer's uncouth factory workers lounge in the company's filthy restroom. It is a hostile environment that Kent tries to avoid but can't. Although he refrains from using the toilet, Kent reluctantly visits the facility on a daily basis because of his compulsive need to cleanup after lunch. One particular day Kent eats a bowl of chili which causes him major discomfort. Hoping he can get through the workday without using the facility, Kent deals with his discomfort, vowing to last until quitting time so he can to use his own throne at home. Just when the end of the day nears with relief approaching, an untimely phone call from his sultry and irresistible wife complicates the matter. Kent has little choice but to use the facility for the common man in a way he could have never planned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187430</url></doc>
