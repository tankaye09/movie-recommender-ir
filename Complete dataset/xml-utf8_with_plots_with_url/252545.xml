<plot>Lee takes his sister Claudia to a Psychic to have her fortune told. But once they get there, the Psychic quickly turns her attention toward Lee, warning him that his girlfriend will die today at four o'clock. She also tells him of the warning signs to watch out for. But Lee doesn't believe in fate, and is less than amused by this new information. That is until he begins to see the signs coming true right before his eyes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252545</url></doc>
