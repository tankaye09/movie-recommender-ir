<plot>Anthem is a film that explores the fundamental question, "What is an American?" Anthem presents a personal view of how American's see themselves, and how a single comment, "I'm moving to France," can come to stand for the greater dream of acceptance and self-worth. Filmed on location in College Station and McKinney, Texas as well as Paris and Normandy, France.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042391</url></doc>
