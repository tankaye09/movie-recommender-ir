<plot>"Here is a novel sight - a full grown bear, in a wild state, wrestling with his keeper. After considerable maneuvering, the keeper finally throws him, and the bear acknowledges his defeat by getting up and grinning toward the audience. An excellent film and a very lively subject."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602486</url></doc>
