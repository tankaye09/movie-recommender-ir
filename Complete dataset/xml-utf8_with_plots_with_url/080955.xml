<plot>Dharma works as a Boxer with Kashmir Silk Mills, the Managing Director is very pleased with him, and assures him that if he wins the next boxing bout against Shera, he will send him to London. Unfortunately, Dharma loses the bout, he is grievously injured, unable to box anymore, and shortly thereafter he is fired from his job. Thereafter an embittered Dharma takes to drinking alcohol in a big way, ignoring his pregnant wife, Savitri, &amp; young son, Shankar. Things get worse when Savitri gives birth to a second baby boy, Sonu. Then in order to make ends meet, Shankar takes to stealing, and hiding from the law. Years later, Shankar, now a career criminal, is arrested for stealing a watch from a man coming out of a jewelery store, he is tried in court and sentenced to jail for 6 months. In prison, he meets with boxing manager, Tony Braganza, and after his release he starts to train with him and eventually challenges the reigning Champion, Raghuraj. Shankar loses the fight, is injured, and his girlfriend, Rajni Khatau, makes him promise that he will never fight again. Shortly thereafter, both get married. Now Shankar's father wants to redeem himself by putting Shankar back in the ring, but Shankar refuses, and as a result Dharma goes back to drinking again, blaming his cowardly son for his downfall. The question remains, will Shankar redeem his father's honor by taking up boxing again? and why did Rajni ask Shankar to quit boxing?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080955</url></doc>
