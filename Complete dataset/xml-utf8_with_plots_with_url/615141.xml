<plot>Claire and Catherine (Cat) are two high school students who like many seem to always be looking for something - Claire for a way out of her old life and Cat for a way into something new. Claire's family life definitely leaves something to be desired; her mother believes the pieces are all there, but they just won't fit together no matter how hard she tries to force them. This leaves Claire wandering amidst a world of happy faces looking for a connection. Cat's family seems to be perfect. But this outward appearance cannot completely mask the cracks that are beginning to surface. The two girls meet and seem to perfectly complement each other - Claire the free-spirited senior mentor to the innocent younger Cat. During an emotionally trying two-weeks the girls build a friendship that could last forever, but forces outside their control intervene. Cat and Claire are desperate to stay together, but are they willing to pay the price?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615141</url></doc>
