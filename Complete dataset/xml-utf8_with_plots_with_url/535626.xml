<plot>When Woody makes way too much racket with his TV set and musical instruments, his neighbors have had enough and evict him from the entire city! He decides he'd be better off living in the "wide open spaces" anyway and makes himself a home out west... on top of an Indian's tepee. The Indian is not pleased with the intrusive woodpecker and tries to remove him from his premises... with little luck. Finally, the Indian slingshots the redhead back to where he came from, only to discover his TV set is left behind and is now playing "The Woody Woodpecker Show"!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?535626</url></doc>
