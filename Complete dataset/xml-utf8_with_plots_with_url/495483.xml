<plot>What if popular psychology was applied to a shy monster created in the bleak and nearly deserted mountain castle of a scientist very much like Doctor Frankenstein? The doctor and his cynical assistant Trevor finish the stitching on a creature, inject the serum of life, and then stare in wonder as the monster just stands there. Trevor is all for dispatching their creation, arguing that it's either dead or stupid. The good doctor, however, posits shyness as the monster's disability, and proceeds to reach it indirectly, with the help of sock puppets, Toastmasters, acting lessons, and a date with she of Project X.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?495483</url></doc>
