<plot>Just like any other elevator in any old building. But elevators aren't ordinary... they're a conveyance true, but they can also become the unlikely place for a rendezvous. That's right, a place where people come together... And the things an elevator sees... Tina Tyler cleverly directs five vignettes with unabashed sexual prowess. Her all-star cast including Nina Hartley, Kylie Ireland, Brooke Hunter and more, peek at their highest performance levels. You'll never take the stairs again!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218436</url></doc>
