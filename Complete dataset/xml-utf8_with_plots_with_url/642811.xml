<plot>Lonely Scientist Dr. Vudka Munster spends many a night pining over the long-lost love of his life. He tries to dull his pain and the voices in his head with drinking, but it just isn't enough. Desperate, he decides to do what makes sense to him - rebuild her. What seems to be the solution to his problem may prove to be more than he can handle as he soon realizes that making a new friend isn't always easy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?642811</url></doc>
