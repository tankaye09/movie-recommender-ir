<plot>A picture true to life, and a most excellent subject. Poor old grandma is seated in her chair, vainly attempting to engage a thread in the eye of the needle. The facial contortions that are engaged in are ludicrous to say the least. The needle is finally threaded, and the happy contented look that comes over the face of grandma is a most pleasing ending of the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221757</url></doc>
