<plot>Who would have thought a sex-themed video would offer so much insight into the human condition, particularly in terms of sexual communication. Enter Ed Powers, who has subsequently built an empire in the field with the production of the 'Dirty Debutantes' series; he attempts to pick up women at bus stops and tries to convince them to shed their clothing before the camera, and to engage in sex play. This is a real documentary, as one is shocked that women would actually get into a car with a strange man in this day and age.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087410</url></doc>
