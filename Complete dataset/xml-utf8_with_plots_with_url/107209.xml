<plot>CISMA, tells the dramatic story of Anna and her destructive relationship with herself and others. The story is simple enough; what happens to Anna is all too commonplace. Having serious plans with her not so serious boyfriend, Rob, she is devastated when he ends their relationship to pursue other sexual interests. Trying to cope with the break up, Anna seduces Rob's best friend, Trevor. Which leads to a confrontation between the three, an unaccepted revelation and a revealing ending that shows Anna's true relation to her reality. Anna, for most of the story, feels certain she is the victim of life's situations. Only later to find out that she has been in control the whole time. CISMA is a story that shows that life is as absolute and absurd as dreams are.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107209</url></doc>
