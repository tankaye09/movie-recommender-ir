<plot>Filmmaker Carl Paoli, sets out to document an elusive and controversial graffiti artist who sneaks around the city at night painting murals of enormous magnitude in the most unbelievable places. Seeing the reaction of all those who experience this illegal display of personal and political art, is worth the quest. Seeming to touch on very real issues and feelings, this graffiti artist makes no apologies for his shocking displays of the truth. The mystery to find out who and why this graffiti artist takes the risk of imprisonment and even worse the wrath of angry cops and property owners to display his emotionally moving work, is just a small piece of a much larger puzzle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?462290</url></doc>
