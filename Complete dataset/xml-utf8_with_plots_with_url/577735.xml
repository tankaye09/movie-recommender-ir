<plot>Cantinflas, the greatest Mexican comic, is back in 2003 ready for his close-up! Born in 1911 in Mexico City's poorest neighborhood, Cantinflas became a popular comic and dancer for traveling carpas or vaudeville tent shows that traveled around the country. In 1937, he filmed his first movie and went on to become a major star, filming fifty-one movies including two for Hollywood. "Around the World in 80 days" won an Oscar and made Cantinflas an international star. After his celebrated film career, Cantinflas was known as a union organizer, a philantropist and humanitarian. Charlie Chaplin called Cantinflas "the greatest comic who ever lived").</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577735</url></doc>
