<plot>With the blessings of Jimi's biological family and many of his closest friends, Passport brings the life of Jimi Hendrix to light as never before. From his upbringing in Seattle to his final days in London, JIMI HENDRIX: THE UNCUT STORY goes beyond all previously released documentaries to explore the complete life-story behind the legendary artist. Episode 1: 1942-1961 The first part of this three-episode series takes us through Jimi's life in Seattle, Washington where he spent two-thirds of his twenty-seven years. Through the recollection of his closest friends and family, we enter into the inner world of Jimi's childhood upbringing. This is where we come to know the people and events that would shape his love for music and define the extraordinary man he would become. Episode 2: 1961 - 1967 After Jimi's stint in the army, we join him as a sideman on the Chitlin' Circuit playing behind some of the greatest names in R&amp;B. After following Jimi to New York, we head off to the UK where Jimi Hendrix became the toast of swinging London virtually overnight. Hear directly from the British rock stars and scenesters who witnessed Jimi's musical coup d'état firsthand. Then follow the Jimi Hendrix Experience on their way to becoming the hottest rock trio on the world stage. Episode 3: 1967 - 1970 Part three highlights the culmination of Jimi's musical career. It was the peak of the counter-culture era and the world was changing at an incredible pace. Jimi's music and lifestyle were no exception. Here is where we follow Jimi to the height of his creative powers, both in the studio and on the road - only to watch it all come crashing down upon him. Through exclusive interviews, we get the facts behind Jimi's demise and examine the events surrounding his controversial death. But more than that - we come to know the spiritual message behind Jimi's work and celebrate the final stage of his life in music.  </plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277070</url></doc>
