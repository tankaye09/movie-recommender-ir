<plot>JACK'S HAT' is set in 1916. It is the story of Jack Mac Manus, a 21 years old lad Who has a lot of growing up to do. Jack is like every modern bloke, totally self-consumed with his appearance, his fashion, especially his hats, and women. He has no interest in the world or events outside his own little circle. Reality and responsibility are alien concepts. His latest obsession is a blue tweed hat with a felt trim, the inside is lined with satin and it's only 1s 6d. He wheedles the money for 'the newest hat on the market' from his mother. On his journey through Dublin to buy his new hat he bumps into a Dublin 'character' Who for all his crazy ways is more in touch with reality than Jack. He also meets some snobby girls who he believes will fall at his feet the minute he dons his new hat. He buys the hat not knowing there's a huge wake up call for the self-serving Jack Mac Manus the minute the hat lands on his head. On leaving the hat shop Jack walks slap bang into the outbreak of fighting in the 1916 Rising.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272126</url></doc>
