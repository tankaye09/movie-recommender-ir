<plot>Rivals in public, allies in private: The now-legendary "Northern Kick" Shao Yi-Fei has been framed for the murder of "Southern Fist" Shen Yin-Wai's younger brother. Once again joining forces, they uncover the mastermind behind the setup to prove Shao's innocence. Chen Chung Lam produced this third reprise of the "Secret Rivals" franchise created by Hong Kong's renowned martial arts filmmaker Ng See-Yuen and, consequently, the film carries an entirely different feel from the other two despite the continued participation of marquee star John Liu. Action director Robert Tai pulled double duty as the villain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579060</url></doc>
