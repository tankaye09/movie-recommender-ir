<plot>A realistic tale of an intellectual couple whose stagnant marriage is put to test. The wife's audacious, sexy friend arrives for an indefinite period. The husband initially detests the bold, seductive and uninvited stranger whose frank observations lead his wife to question their 11-year union. The husband is a taxi driver unmotivated to finish his masters degree in sociology. His marriage has degenerated into a sexless habit with minimal communication. Predictably, the stranger's presence provokes change via conflict. Surprisingly, the husband and wife eventually rediscover their love for one another after brief affairs outside their marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217443</url></doc>
