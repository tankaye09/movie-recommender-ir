<plot>Brian Dykstra's rage ignites in THE JESUS FACTOR, an uncensored and outrageously funny one man tour de force about religious hypocrisy and power. As if rave reviews from New York critics weren't enough to validate his ferocious, stinging rebukes of those who hold this nation hostage with their constant drumbeat of fear, Dykstra has been branded as an "enemy" by Rush Limbaugh while finding himself on many of the Radical Right's most virulent watch lists, including the NRA's. If dissent is a hallmark of the American tradition, Brian Dykstra stands in the forefront of a new generation of America's greatest patriots.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082757</url></doc>
