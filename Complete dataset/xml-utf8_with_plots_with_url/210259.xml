<plot>This 2D platform game is Garfield's fifth foray into the world of video games. And his first adventure into the TV. For real. The game centers around his plight of being 'sucked in' to the late night movies he was watching. The player advances through levels and bonus rounds in his attempt to escape. Unlike other platform, Garfield: Caught in the Act boasts completely unique art on each of its six levels, both for tile art and character costumes. The levels are inspired by classic movies, but given a Garfield twist, like 'Catsablanca' and 'The Curse of Cleocatra'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210259</url></doc>
