<plot>A reality-show around a women's love boot-camp is hosted by matchmaker Steve Ward who is the son of successful matchmaker Joann Ward. His brutal honesty makes for an entertaining "tough love" advisory approach to helping these nine love troubled women deal with their issues. Classic character personalities earning titles such as "the gold digger" or "Wedding Obsessed." Watch as they learn how to change themselves in order to better themselves and attract good men. They will participate in dating 101 classes under the male matchmaker. See who has "daddy issues" to overcome. See them go through personal challenges as well as the ones setup for them. Who will leave and who will stay?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?614380</url></doc>
