<plot>A parade highlights the Screen Actors Guild's Film Stars Frolic, hosted by 'Walter Winchell' (qv) as Master of Ceremonies. The Royal Canadian Mounted parade; 'William Gargan' (qv), 'Gary Cooper (I)' (qv) and his wife Rocky are seen; 'Mary Astor' (qv) is Queen, and 'James Cagney' (qv), on a horse, is Prince of Pep. 'Ann Harding' (qv) on a horse, 'Stuart Erwin (I)' (qv) in an oxcart, 'Eddie Cantor' (qv) in a chariot, 'Wallace Ford' (qv) and 'Shirley Temple' (qv) are seen, 'Chester Morris (I)' (qv) and 'Mary Astor' (qv) catch the chariot race, and 'Alice White (I)' (qv) and husband 'Sy Bartlett' (qv) are seen. 'Billy Barty' (qv) bursts a balloon of Italian balloon seller 'Monte Carter' (qv) and is chased. 'Lee Moran (I)' (qv) is a barker, 'Mary Astor' (qv) buys a balloon, 'Arthur Housman' (qv), drunk, leers at her, and Mary loses her pearl necklace as barker 'Sam Hardy (I)' (qv) guesses Billy's weight wrong. The balloon man pays Billy to pop balloons in order that more will be bought. Meantime a necklace search is underway and Chester's balloon is popped. An organ grinder with a monkey plays "Dixie" and Winchell announces that Shirley Jean Durst will do horse tricks. 'William S. Hart' (qv) and 'Alice Faye' (qv) sit together; 'May Robson' (qv) is glimpsed, as a cop becomes suspicious of Billy. A Texas longhorn steer jumps over a car; 'Kenneth Thomson (I)' (qv) looks for the necklace, which Mary finds on Housman's balloon. Cantor looks at the camera, Mary smiles, and it's all over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564755</url></doc>
