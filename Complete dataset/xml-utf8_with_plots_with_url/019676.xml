<plot>This diaristic documentary follows Sokly Ny, an under-priveledged and under-represented immigrant minority student, through his final year of high school in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ny, A.K.A. Don Bonus, provides commentary on his life, recounting the difficulty and triumph of his everyday experience. The drama builds to a crescendo as the day of his graduation ceremonies corresponds with the criminal trial of his brother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019676</url></doc>
