<plot>David Morton wasn't prepared for the breakdown of his marriage. He wasn't ready when his wife abandoned him and their two young daughters. But when he journeys into the harsh Australian desert, David soon discovers just how ill-equipped he is for life as a single parent. In an attempt to keep his family from crumbling completely and win back the love and trust of his daughters, who resent him for the departure of their mother, David embarks on a trip to the outback. Together with his daughters, Marnie and Karla, the family travel deep into the remote wilderness. When their station wagon blows a tyre, their trip is brought to a sudden halt. David quickly realises that they have no spare, and with no cellphone signal or person for miles, the truly dangerous nature of their predicament emerges. The day is drawing to an end and as the sun sets the family is forced to camp in the outback. Through the harsh desert sun and the cold, windy night, the strain and despair surrounding the separation begin to surface. The anguish between David and his daughters finally erupts in a heartbreaking confrontation, wherein David finally learns of the suffering that his children have also endured due to their mother leaving. The family are forced to show their true emotions and deal with their loss, all the while attempting to escape the Australian outback and return home safely.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083953</url></doc>
