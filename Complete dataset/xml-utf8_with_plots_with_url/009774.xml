<plot>If you've never been good at anything in your life, why would murder be any different? A Dog's Breakfast is a head smacking, bone breaking, fiancé bashing romp, about a family that just loves themselves to pieces. Patrick has always had a somewhat combative relationship with his little sister Marilyn. But when she brings home her new TV star fiancé Ryan, it's all out war. When Patrick fails to drive a wedge between the happy couple, he reaches for sharper instruments. Every family has a few skeletons in the closet; A Dog's Breakfast is the nightmarishly funny mess Patrick makes when he tries to add another to his.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009774</url></doc>
