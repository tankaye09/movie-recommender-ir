<plot>The Guajiros are a people who have survived the harsh elements of their desert environment and the intervention of outside cultures. Through the centuries, they have learned to interpret the values and laws of those cultures to assure the perpetuation of their race. In this film, their art and ancient ceremonies are intermingled with the economic and socio-political realities existing in Latin America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?310072</url></doc>
