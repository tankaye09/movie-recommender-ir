<plot>Lena, the operator of a lingerie shop where she models the merchandise for some of her male customers in order to make a sale, is approached by a mysterious woman, Karine Delacroix, the day following a wild night of sex with one of those male customers, Étienne. The woman offers her a large sum of money to engage in sex at her home that evening. A chauffeur arrives at closing time to drive her to the appointment, and Lena "pumps" him unsuccessfully for information about his employer. Arriving at Karine's home she's met by two large black male servants who've been instructed to "give her a try", by force if necessary. Her hostess watches from a distance. Afterwards, Karine discloses that Étienne is her estranged husband, and she wants Lena to help her win him back by teaching her to be the kind of slut Étienne seems to prefer. The tutoring begins immediately as Lena and Karine make love on the sofa, joined eventually by Karine's young maid, Jung, who appears wearing a strap-on. From there, Lena introduces Karine to all manner of perversions. If Lena succeeds in her tutelage of Karine, she stands to make a small fortune, but she might just lose Étienne in the bargain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?302914</url></doc>
