<plot>Wealthy Seth Amirchand (Kader Khan) has two problems, namely his two good-for-nothing sons, Sonu (Sanjay Dutt), and Monu (Govinda). Their time is mainly spent on comically attempting to extort money from their hapless dad, by hook or by crook, by threats or blackmail. Amirchand decides that the best way to deal with them is to separate them, he then asks Sonu to proceed to Goa; and Monu to look after work in Bombay. Sonu gets to the wrong party in Goa and antagonizes the Verma family, consisting of Gulzarilal (Anupam Kher), his unmarried sister, Santho (Aruna Irani), and eligible daughters, Pooja (Pooja Batra) and Ritu (Karisma Kapoor). Sonu challenges the family that he is going to marry Pooja by any means possible, and calls upon Monu to act as his Paternal uncle, which he does so, and ends up falling for Ritu. Unknown to him, Santho has also developed a crush on him. To complicate matters even more, underworld don, Bhai (Ashish Vidyarthi) demands money from Amirchand, only to have Amirchand mock and ridicule him, thinking it is another prank by his sons, this is when the family realize that pranks can indeed turn deadly, with Bhai who has sworn to avenge this humiliation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231221</url></doc>
