<plot>Rajeshwar belongs to a wealthy family, and is the only son of Dharamraj, who is an industrialist, and partners with Naglingam Reddy, Nagendra, and Dhanraj. Rajeshwar meets Bharati, who comes from a very poor family, and falls in love with her. Bharati's father is a schoolteacher, Vishnupratap, and has also to beg for food house to house to make ends meet. Bharati initially does not reciprocrate Rajeshwar's affection, but when she realizes that he really does love her, she too falls in love with him. Bharati's has a neighbor, Tilak, who is unemployed, and lives with his mother, Sharda, who works as a maidservant in a rich family's house. Tilak falls in love with the daughter, Rani, of this rich family. Both Rajeshwar and Tilak dislike each other. Then Dharamraj gets killed, and the evidence points towards Tilak. Tilak is arrested and unless he can gather evidence that clears him, he may face the death sentence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357138</url></doc>
