<plot> comedy/drama of 3 friends in their waning twenties living in Chicago, who have found themselves at a crossroad in life. The dilemma is that part of them wants to stay parked in front of the TV, smoking pot on a beat up couch in their fraternity house. Reality is that time has caught up with them, and they all know that they have to grow up, start their career and begin their family. The balance between work/life and the party becomes difficult, and usually intrudes on each. The only thing remaining constant, is their friendship. Each episode starts on Sunday around noon. After rolling out of bed, usually hung over, they discuss what happened to them the prior week. The events are all told in flashbacks, set up with voice over descriptions from the point of view of each character. Many of the situations will be seen differently from each of the guys or girls point of view, which will cause an argument about what really did happen. Usually resulting in someone being awarded the coveted "Drunk of the Night."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?468483</url></doc>
