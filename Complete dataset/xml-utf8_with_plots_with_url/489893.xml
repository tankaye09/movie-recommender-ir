<plot>In the midst of the recession of the late 80's, two factory workers devise an amateur plan to escape their blue-collar life by boosting a truckload of sugar from the factory employing them. After enlisting the aid of the town Repo man to drive the truck, Dimon and Arlonzo decide it's best to run with the money. Their plan to pin contrasting personalities against each other and create chaos seems successful until someone with a bigger plan is revealed from the shadows. Witness the becoming of Daxter Tarta as he swims in the places that can't be seen. See the twenty something year old man who doesn't seem to have a choice. And watch as he stumbles into an amateur heist that would become his future. The foundation and the escape to what will become his empire in Crystal City.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?489893</url></doc>
