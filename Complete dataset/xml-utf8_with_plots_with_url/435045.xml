<plot>Being a good hitter takes years of dedication, excellent vision, hand-eye coordination and more than anything, determination. In this 45 minute Basic Hitting program we will cover all the fundamental skills that are needed to be a successful batter as well as practice drills to keep them sharp all year long. As an added bonus we have included a group of real kids asking real questions about their own batting concerns with All Star Coach, Reggie Smith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435045</url></doc>
