<plot>As a man attempts to record a video message for his best friend's funeral, he is rudely interrupted by a brick smashing through his window. Wrapped around the brick is an offensively racist note, obviously not intended for him. The man - a classic Canadian - decides to politely bring the brick over to his African-Canadian neighbour, so he can continue with his recording. The Racist Brick is a hilarious and awkward off-beat short film from the minds of Adam Brodie &amp; Dave Derewlany.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585112</url></doc>
