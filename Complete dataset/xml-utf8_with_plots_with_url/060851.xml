<plot>Two swimmers appear on the edge of a beautiful river, evidently having come prepared for a swim, as, upon removing their clothing, they are seen to be attired in bathing suits. They dive head first into the water, and from this point on the action of the film is reversed, producing very comical effects. The bathers spring backwards out of the water, feet first, and each article of clothing jumps up from the ground and flies into its place, causing shrieks of laughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060851</url></doc>
