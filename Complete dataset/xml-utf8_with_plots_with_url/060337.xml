<plot>Aditya is a young man who lives in Bangalore, India. He does not believe in astrology, but when a friend makes his astrological chart and explains to him that he is fated to meet and marry a woman whose name begins with the letter "V", Aditya decides to see for himself if this actually works. Miraculously, he meets with a pretty young woman named Veda, and both are attracted to each other. They continue meeting and find themselves compatible with each other. What Aditya does not know that the chart was actually prepared for his brother and not him. But will this change their fates?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060337</url></doc>
