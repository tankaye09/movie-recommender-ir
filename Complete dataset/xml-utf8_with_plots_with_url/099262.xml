<plot>This is an entry in Universal's "Name Band Musical" series of shorts, and is not the same as the other three shorts, from three different studios, that featured Welk and his band and had Champagne Music in the title in some fashion. Welk and the band open with a medley including "Josephine", Stumbling", "Honey" and "Running Wild" and vocalist Betty Jane Pettit sings "No Can Do." Kenny Stevens does "Alone" while comedienne-singer Judy Clark offers her versions of "Playmates" and "I'm Nobody's Baby." The dance team of Jon and Inga Bergy is also in the mix. Universal production number 2302, which was changed to 3507 when this was reissued in October, 1957.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099262</url></doc>
