<plot>"Friendly Surprises" stars Maryland native Steve Lee in the role of lonely Joe Higgins who spends his free time sitting on the couch wondering what life would be like if the girl of his dreams finally realized he existed. He just can't seem to find a girlfriend, although he's searching desperately for love. But he thinks he's found the answer when he helps the lovely Veronica (Salma Qanain) into the apartment next door. Joe launches into a hearty campaign to woo his new neighbor by sending Veronica little gifts - a bouquet of flowers here, a box of chocolates there. Veronica responds with equal vigor to Joe's advances - or so Joe thinks. "Friendly Surprises" mixes classic romantic comedy with a touch of mistaken identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204458</url></doc>
