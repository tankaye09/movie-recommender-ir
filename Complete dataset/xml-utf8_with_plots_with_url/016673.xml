<plot>This dark psychological thriller tells of the incredible and terrifying events that surround psychiatrist Robert Cavendish when he inherits a decrepit, yellowed journal from his family. The journal appears to have been written by the infamous Whitechapel murderer, who terrorized the streets of the East End of London in 1888. Filled with dramatic imagery and an underlying sense of foreboding and danger, this compelling novel will certainly lend itself well to the transformation from page to screen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016673</url></doc>
