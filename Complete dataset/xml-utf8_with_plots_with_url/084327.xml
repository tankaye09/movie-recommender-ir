<plot>This is the story of the war that altered Spanish history, the struggle between the supporters and opponents of the Spanish Second Republic, which raged between 1936 and 1939. During the war, new names were written large in world history; names such as the Republican supporting International Brigade and the Nationalist General Franco, who led his side to ultimate victory. Features archival film and location footage, plus dramatized eyewitness accounts. With many photographic images, the program also features expert interpretation and analyses to provide historical and political background to the war.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084327</url></doc>
