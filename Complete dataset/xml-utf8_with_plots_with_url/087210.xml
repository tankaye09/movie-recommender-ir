<plot>Two beautiful, young women who share a secret love affair decide to embark on a weekend-long road trip. One of them is married. Her husband, aware of her adulterous and lesbian life style gives her an ultimatum. The woman has to choose between her husband and her lesbian love affair; it's a choice between having to adhere to society versus following one's heart. The character's struggle to decide is embodied in a surreal, fantastical projection of her old, future self. That 'old self', almost a deus ex machina, will help her make the right decision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087210</url></doc>
