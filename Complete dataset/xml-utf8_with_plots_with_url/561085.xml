<plot>Gabe thought it was a toy, an innocent device which could improve his score at computer games, but, in reality, it was a five-fingered fiend from Hell! It was The Glove: The Devil's own peripheral, forged in the burning, sulfurous pits of Hell and bent on destroying the souls of all who touch it. Unsuspectingly let loose, the world's most evil computer device wrecks carnage and terror in this "gripping" FX-fest as the hero risks soul and sanity to end its diabolical designs before "game over". Based on GameSpy's Daily Victim columns by Dave "Fargo" Kosak, this short spoof of B-grade horror films and computer-game culture grabs straight for the funny bone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?561085</url></doc>
