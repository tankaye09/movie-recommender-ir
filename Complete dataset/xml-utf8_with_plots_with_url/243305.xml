<plot>Hollywood Jerome, is a fourteen year old African American boy who grew up on the Southside of Chicago. He has a tumultuous childhood; he can't remember his mother and he never met his father. He is consumed by the images of gangsters portrayed by Hollywood and wishes to be like them. In the beginning of the film, he is shown lying on his bed with posters of famous gangster movies like "Scarface." As he grows up he winds up being part of a gang called Black Stone. Hollywood Jerome robs houses and is an alleged carjacker. One day he is stealing from a truck outside of a store, and before he gets caught he runs away into a young Caucasian girl's back yard. The girl sees him while listening to a story about a carjacker on the news, and assumes Hollywood Jerome must be the same person. She yells for her mom to call the police.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243305</url></doc>
