<plot>notdef., that could mean not deaf or, who knows, not defined. The monotonous thump of a percussively contoured, slightly delayed techno bass line underlies the images which, abstract and mutating constantly defy quick definition. In notdef./version one, virtual objects vigorously grow across a plane and into space from the center of the image for slightly longer than three minutes; nervously assembling and then falling away from one another, they overlap in glaringly bright colors before sinking back into the black matrix. notdef. intentionally animates associations: It is reminiscent of a security monitor recording an inconceivable nuclear accident, or a sonic depth finder extending into an unknown abyss. And the synthetic mates with the organic: Fine digital branches and artificial flashes of electricity constantly grow toward the viewer in this video, into the simulation of pictorial depth in which, again and again, for no longer than fractions of a second, concrete objects become visible among the rays of light and stroboscopic interference Â­ the silhouette of a human figure, then an industrial landscape, traces of an external world within the inner electronic world which is apparently hermetically sealed. White light streams out, it circles and dances and burns into the retina, unpredictable and unstoppable, a visual delirium: wild geometric growth from the interior of the machine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401329</url></doc>
