<plot>A student adaptation of a small section from Jonathan Franzen's 'The Corrections', the film follows a college professor after he spends several wild nights with one of his undergraduate students. Associate Professor Chip Lambert was about to attain the culmination of all his academic efforts: a tenured position at a prestigious liberal arts school. After things at the university begin to go wrong, however, he succumbs to his own weaknesses and the manipulations of Melissa Paquette, a young, entitled and supercilious undergrad. Awakening in a Chicago motel room on Thanksgiving morning with the realization that the life he has worked so hard to create is about to take a dark turn, Chip is forced to acknowledge what he has been avoiding for quite some time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550270</url></doc>
