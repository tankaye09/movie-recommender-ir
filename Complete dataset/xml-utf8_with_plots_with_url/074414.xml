<plot>Utilizing stock footage from several Columbia western serials, primarily 1941's "White Eagle", with Lee Roberts costumed to match Buck Jones with more than a few shots of Bob Woodward doubling Jones from that serial, "Blazing the Overland Trail" is Columbia's 57th and last serial production, and also the last sound-era serial (of 231 total) made for theatrical release, a comment made knowing full well somebody will try to stretch the definition of a serial to fit "Star Wars." This entry also borrowed more than a little bit of the plot from "White Eagle" and "Overland With Kit Carson" but not enough to be called a remake of either, and finds pioneers, Indians and outlaws fighting in the 19th century American west, and scattered Army units hard pressed to preserve order. Army scout Tom Bridger is allied with Pony Express relay station manager Ed Marr and U.S. Cavalry Captain Frank Carter in opposing the schemes of Rance Devlin, who seeks to build his own range empire and private army and terrorizes the frontier with his Black Raiders - borrowed from "Overland With Kit Carson" - who are armed with repeating rifles and aided by Indians.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074414</url></doc>
