<plot>Psychology intern, Vincent Victor, discovers that his patient, Edward, seems to be experiencing a mythical psychological disorder he calls the Vitruvian Lapse. It is a disorder where a given victim sees everything backwards, as if looking into mirror. Vincent says Leonardo DaVinci was the first documented individual to show symptoms of this disorder, claiming it to be the cause of his infamous mirrored journals. Now with Edward beginning to show symptoms, he feels he has made a psychological and historical breakthrough. Though in an unusual twist of events, Vincent discovers his theory proves true and plunges him into a race to save his most precious commodity: his sanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599328</url></doc>
