<plot>In the dark recess of the Yakuza underworld, a sibling rivalry erupts into a full-blown civil war for control of a Japanese crime family. In a desperate bid to win, a Yakuza underling does the unthinkable; he kidnaps the daughter of a former assassin, hoping to use him to eliminate his rivals. The assassin however, is his own brother, who disappeared years ago to start a new life. Now forced out of retirement to do his brother's bidding, Toshiro must agree to Kenji's wishes in order to save his daughter's life. He must once again draw the family's treasured KATANA and use it to eliminate their enemies. Upon completion of his assignments, Toshiro is told by Kenji that he is not yet done. He must eliminate one more target; their youngest brother, Yoshio. A climatic showdown ensues when Toshiro realizes there is no end to his brother's ambition, and that he must risk losing his daughter and kill Kenji before his family is pulled deeper into a life where death is the only escape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287770</url></doc>
