<plot>A fifty something man with a harsh look is cleaning and loading guns while is constantly saying, with a menacing tone, lines about slavery and death penalty to be abolished. When he finishes, he puts his guns and grenades in a leather briefcase and leaves his office. The suspect heads toward the Hall of Justice and shows to the policemen some professional I.D., he is an attorney... He gets into the Hall of Justice without being searched, neither his briefcase. Like Janus, the man shows a double face, ready to spread violence all over the world to make people respect peaceful ideas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273931</url></doc>
