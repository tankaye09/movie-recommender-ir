<plot>LE GANT / THE GLOVE is an 8-minute romantic comedy without dialogs. It tells the story of Hervé, a small man who would love to seduce women. One day on his way to work, he picks up the glove that an attractive business woman, Myriam, has dropped. Determined to find her, give her back her glove and possibly get acquainted with her. But things turn out quite differently from what Hervé had imagined. LE GANT / THE GLOVE was shot simultaneously with a traditional 35mm camera and with DALSA's new Origin, a 4K digital camera that aims to equal, if not surpass, the quality of celluloid. Different versions of LE GANT / THE GLOVE exist (35mm, HD as well as 4K and 2K digital) and the producers have shown comparative versions at various technological events in Canada, the United States, France and Italy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?324161</url></doc>
