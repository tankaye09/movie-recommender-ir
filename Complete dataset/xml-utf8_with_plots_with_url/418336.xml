<plot>Outback house follows the incredible journey of a small group of intrepid Australians. who, travel back in time almost 150 years to live on a remote, 10,000 acre sheep station. Diving headlong into this harsh world for three months were 16 strong minded personalities - it was an adventure of a life time and a huge gamble for all. Everything on Oxley Downs, was exactly as it would have been in 1861. With only the tools of the time our time travelers lived off what they could grow or kill as they coped with the dust, the heat and the isolation of a world without running water, electricity or modern technology.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418336</url></doc>
