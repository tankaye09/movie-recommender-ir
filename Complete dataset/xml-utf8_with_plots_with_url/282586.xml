<plot>When Parvathi, a newcomer from Sri Lanka, enters the Gr. 5 class wearing a little dot on her forehead, some classmates are curious while others express their racist attitudes. The tide changes when Parvathi gives her teacher a package of red dots or bindis, a South Asian cultural symbol, as a birthday present. Fascinated by the symbol on their teacher, the other children rush to adorn themselves with their own little red dot only to be faced with the insensitivity of their peers in the schoolyard. Realizing the hurt and pain felt by discrimination, these children decide they must educate their peers. Together they create an ingenious solution and set out on a mission to challenge prejudice and spread the message of respect and understanding for people of all backgrounds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282586</url></doc>
