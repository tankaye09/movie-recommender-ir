<plot>It is 1920s, Andalucía, Spain. Sasha García, the oldest child and only son of an affluent farmer, lives a storybook life. He works the land that he loves by day, and secretly falls into the arms of his lover, Emilio, by night. But when Sasha's serious yet permissive father finally puts his foot down, the son must face the prospect of marrying Isabel, the daughter of a neighboring landholder. He resists, but when Emilio shows less strength and succumbs to his family's pressure to marry, Sasha falls into dark depression and makes the only choice left to him: marry Isabel and choose a life of subservience to tradition. On the even of Sasha's wedding, a distraught Emilio returns to beg Sasha to run away with him. But it is too late: Sasha has made his choice and will do his duty. His future no longer holds the prospect of true love; only the bittersweet joy of following the family tradition of working the land.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580582</url></doc>
