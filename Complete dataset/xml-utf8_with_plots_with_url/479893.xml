<plot>The Scary Godmother Halloween Spooktakular is based on the comics and children's books of popular artist and writer Jill Thompson. Jill has won numerous awards for her fabulous watercolour paintings and illustrations. Scary Godmother is the whimsical all-ages story that follows the first trick-or-treating adventure of Hannah Marie, a young girl whose rotten older cousin is babysitting her one dark Halloween. Unhappy to be saddled with Hannah, her cousin cooks up a scheme to frighten her. But his scheme backfires when Hannah gets help from her Scary Godmother. Scary Godmother takes Hannah to her realm on the Fright Side where she is throwing the best Halloween party in all of frightdom. At the party Hannah is introduced to many colourful characters, learns that not all monsters are mean and enlists her new spooky friends in a plan to teach Jimmy a lesson.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479893</url></doc>
