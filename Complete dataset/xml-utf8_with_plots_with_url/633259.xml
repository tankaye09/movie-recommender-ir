<plot>Native Americans in Northern California fight for their fish and the survival of their culture. An energy corporation is messing up their river with a series of hydro-power dams, contributing to one of the worst fish die-offs in U.S. history. To confront their opponents, tribal members first travel to Scotland, then to the second-richest man in the United States. The dam owners praise hydro-power as a low-cost, climate-friendly source of energy, a valuable resource they say they couldn't afford to lose. Yet, the tribes may soon trigger the largest dam removal project in history. Among films about the Klamath River, this documentary is the only one made from a non-American perspective.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?633259</url></doc>
