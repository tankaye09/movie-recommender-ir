<plot>A small New England town is rocked by a vampire scare. Many people have been murdered and their blood has been sucked. Ronny, manager of a local comic book store, who is house-sitting at a future historical site, decides to kidnap a woman who he believes is with Satan. He locks her up in the attic of the historical home. He's joined by two thugs, Karl and Eddie, who enjoy tormenting the woman. All they need is her confession which Ronny can record with his digital camcorder. However, their guest begins to alarm her hosts with some very strange behavior. Soon their dreams of becoming rich and famous turn into a violent nightmare. From Christopher Ward, writer/director of Person of Interest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198774</url></doc>
