<plot>An old Hobo is spending his days picking up cans to feed himself, but he is known around town for telling great stories to those who care to listen. His stories tell of fantastic voyages of love and loss, but each one has a sort of realness that keeps his audience guessing. "Was that you in that story? Could it have been? No, it couldn't." He walks the streets, and entertains while never feeling pity for being where he is. A young woman is in a rocky relationship, but it seems that she just needs someone to fill a certain void in her life. Her husband is rude, distant and shows no concern for her well being. She can stand her ground, but what she thinks is love puts her in a far too vulnerable position. After visiting the grave of someone near to her, they drive off with many thoughts swirling in their heads. After the young detached couple's car comes to a screeching halt, they realize that they have actually hit an old man. They try and rush him to a place where he will receive help, not knowing if he will live or die. At this moment those two people, likely never to meet, do. What happens when their worlds collide?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?593642</url></doc>
