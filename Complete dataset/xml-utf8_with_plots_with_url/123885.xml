<plot>Pooja has been brought up by her grandparents, and has no recollection of her mom and dad. She is told by her grandpa, Kantaprasad, that her dad had passed away. Years later, Pooja has now grown up. She starts getting mysterious phone calls from a male who merely says "I love you", and hangs-up. When her grandpa has these phone calls traced, the caller is Anand, Pooja's dad. Kantaprasad has him beaten up, and warns him against contacting Pooja again. When Pooja is being molested by a male in her apartment building, Anand comes to her rescue, and it is then Pooja comes to know that this shabby, alcoholic man is her dad.
