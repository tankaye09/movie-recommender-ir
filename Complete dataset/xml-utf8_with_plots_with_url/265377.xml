Spending his entire life the tortured prisoner of the demon Ch'Goth, Harry is unable to die and forced to watch all those he loves pass. But finally, he has found a way out. Summoning Ch'Goth and confronting him directly, Harry finally realizes the true nature of his punishment. At long last being absolved of his sins, Harry is guided to salvation by his long time friend and, (unbeknownst to him) guardian angel, Arnold.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265377</url></doc>
