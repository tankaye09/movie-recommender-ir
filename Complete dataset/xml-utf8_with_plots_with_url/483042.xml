<plot>Searching for The Wrong-Eyed Jesus is a captivating and compelling road trip through the creative spirit of the the South of the USA. Director Andrew Douglas's film follows "Alt" Country singer through a gritty terrain of churches,prisons,truckstops,biker bars and coalmines. This journey takes you through a very real contemporary Southern America,a world of marginalised white people and their unique and homemade culture. Along the way are roadside encounters with present-day musical mavericks including The Handsome Family, Johnny Dowd, 16 Horsepower and David Johansen; oldtime banjo player Lee sexton; ockabilly and mountain Gospel churches - and novelist Harry Crews telling grisly stories down a dirt track.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483042</url></doc>
