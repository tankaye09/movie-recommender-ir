<plot>Welcome to the 2009 Afro Oscars! Life could not be better for 33-year-old African American screenwriter, Davon Cole as he sits next to his beautiful girlfriend Lynette and the rest of Black Hollywood's A-List. And the Afro Oscar for best picture goes to...DAVON COLE for HOOD TIMES!!! Davon makes his way to the stage to receive his Afro Oscar when an alarm blares, beep, beep, beep... He snaps awake and reaches to turn off the buzzing alarm clock coming face-to-face with reality and his girlfriend Lynette who's not looking so lovely in her green facemask and rollers. Sick of Hollywood's portrayal of unrealistic urban films, Davon turns to a tennis shoe pimp/manager named Tony to help guide him in the right direction. Tony takes Davon on a Hollywood adventure not to be forgotten. They meet with Joe Black, a militant filmmaker from yesterday who advises Davon that the only way to keep creative control of his film is to make it independent of the Hollywood system. Following Joe's advice, the two go deep into South Central to meet a drug dealer named Gangster who offers to fund the script for one million in cash. They next meet some very square Caucasian producers who think that they know about the hood because they've listened to a rap song or two. Against Davon's wishes, Tony decides to cut a deal with them. The producers take all control away from Davon and begin to butcher his script. Before long his real-to-life urban film is rewritten by cornball writers, Steinberg and Wagner, into a half-assed Hollywood version starring a white dude and a character named J- Diddy. And to top it all off it being directed by hack director Rick Jones. Davon severs ties from Tony and his crap deal with the producers and returns to his day job as a telemarketer. With a household to support and a dream deferred, all seems lost for Davon so he begins to stress about his decision. His losing streak comes to an end as a legit producer named Tom White takes interest in his project "Hood Times" and helps to make Davon's dream a reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243097</url></doc>
