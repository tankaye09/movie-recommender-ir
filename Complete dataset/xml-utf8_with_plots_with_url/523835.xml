<plot>In Haifa, Noam and his older and younger sisters live in a flat with their mom during her trial separation from their dad. Noam longs for his father's return, ritually walking the parapet along the balcony high above the ground, or hanging upside down over the side remembering life with his father. That morning, his mother has taken extra care to dress, and she's called to say she'll be home late with a surprise, so clean the house. Noam is sure that his parents have reconciled. Is he right?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523835</url></doc>
