<plot>Emma, a young wife, is haunted by nightmares of her recent miscarriage. The film begins on the one-month anniversary of this event, as Emma bares her grief in the refuge of her psychiatrist's office. Later, on this pivotal night, her husband, Sam, secretly steals away to her sister, Lana. Alone, Emma fights off her nightmares with pills, until she hears a voice in the darkness and disappears outside. When Sam realizes that his wife is missing, he must make a difficult choice. The film explores the effects of deception on a marriage, and the capacity for vengeance that percolates underneath its sympathetic surface.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201803</url></doc>
