<plot>Unnatural Disaster - Falling through the cracks after Katrina is the result of a New Orleans' native and public school teacher who desperately tries to help her former students and their families. In this post-Katrina world, Diana Boylston travels to document the adjustments and struggles of her students. The documentary includes real events as personal issues evolve for Katrina survivors. It also includes interviews and personal testimonies ranging from politicians, celebrities to eight-year olds. What begins as a way to help young people express their pain, turns into a personal journey and the realization that New Orleans is not okay.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?631341</url></doc>
