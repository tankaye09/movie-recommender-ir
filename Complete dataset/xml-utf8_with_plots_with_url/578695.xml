<plot>Jake and his wife Heidi, returning home from the grocery store, greet their 'new' neighbor across the hall as he is also arriving home. They feel guilty. He moved in a year ago and they have yet to introduce themselves. Their home cooked dinner plans are held up when Heidi realizes they forgot to get olive oil. Jake bounds across the hall to formerly introduce himself and see about some oil. Neighbor Don is quite offended and proceeds to lecture the bewildered Jake on the subject of being neighborly. You might swear you were watching Don Corleone lecture that funeral director on the subject of respect. What will Jake do? What will this olive oil really cost? And why does this film also remind me of the scene from the Godfather where The Don meets his death in the garden? All these questions and more will be answered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578695</url></doc>
