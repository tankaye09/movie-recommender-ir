<plot>Set in the desert landscape of America, Argo is synonymous with loneliness, desperation, and the unconscious longing for human connection. The film tells the story of Becca, a dispossessed soul, who is on the road to nowhere. A chance encounter with Cal and these two strangers travel together to a roadside motel for reasons neither of them understands. On a fateful journey, this is a collision course that will change their lives as they discover, hope can be found in the most unexpected places and in the most unexpected people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045181</url></doc>
