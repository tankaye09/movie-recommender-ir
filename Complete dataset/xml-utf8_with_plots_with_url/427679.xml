<plot>Judge Jagdish Verma (Raza Murad) has an accused by the name of Yogi Shankar (Kiran Kumar) in his courtroom. Judge Verma had at one time been Yogi's defence lawyer, but now must pass sentence against him. Yogi pleads his innocence, but the Judge finds him guilty, and Yogi is sentenced to a long jail term. Yogi swears to avenge this injustice and humiliation. Judge Verma's family consists of Urmilla (Beena), and two sons, Karan and Kunal (Sunil Shetty and Saif Ali Khan respectively), a daughter Tina. Years pass by and Yogi is released from jail. He is obsessed with hatred and vendatta against Judge Verma and his family, and abducts young Tina, and plans to use her to rule over the judge and his judgements. The family is instructed not to contact the police for fear of the death of Tina, and keep this abduction a secret. Tina (Madhoo) grows up in the company of Yogi and his men, without knowing her real parents and her brothers. Tina is then used to ensare the family into more deceit and entrapment as Yogi directs her to do so. And the Verma family has no choice but to agree to Yogi's terms and conditions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427679</url></doc>
