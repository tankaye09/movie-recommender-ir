<plot>The picture opens with a view of the King and Queen landing at Queenstown. Their Majesties are seen stepping from the launch, which brought them ashore, on to the quay, and continuing with an exceptionally fine view of the procession turning the corner of Dame Street and Cork Hill. A close and clear view of their Majesties was obtained.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292394</url></doc>
