<plot>After several years of numbly mourning his parents death, 26 year old Selim (Cevik) takes a chance on the US lottery for passports and wins. He decides to sell the family olive grove to raise enough money to live in Manhattan and to break all roots to Turkey, leaving his girlfriend behind. When Selim's aged grand uncle, Nasuhi (Keskin) returns from Russia after 58 years he asks Selim to visit with him the olive grove of his youth. Before they depart, Nasuhi finds a beaten Russian girl, Olga (Bielska) who was robbed when she tried to sell herself to raise money to continue her own search for her sea faring father. The three of them visit the olive grove and still standing farmhouse, which Nasuhi immediately starts to repair. Upset with his grand uncles enthusiasm Selim quickly finds a developer who buys the olive grove and reluctantly takes title to the farmhouse as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236953</url></doc>
