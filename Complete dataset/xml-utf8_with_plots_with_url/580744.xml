<plot>In Harlem, Martin Blaze, a writer for Vibe, thinks he's a loser since his fianc√©e cheated on him. The evening after his father's funeral, he meets the lovely Paula, runs into her the next day, but is sure she'll never look twice at him. His older brother Junnie offers to coach him on how to be a player, promising Martin that within two weeks, she'll be his. The lessons commence, and Martin succeeds in meeting women and getting their phone numbers. But he's neglecting his work, carping at his mom, and behaving badly toward his loyal friend Bobbi. Meanwhile, Junnie's life isn't going well either as money problems mount. Can Martin regain his better self - and not lose Paula?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580744</url></doc>
