<plot>Two lovers are seated on a plank which is placed over a stump on a country road. The old farmer, who is selling eggs from a basket, comes along, and not noticing the two lovers, seats himself comfortably on one end of the plank. The lovers suddenly jump up, dumping the old hayseed headlong into the road. He grows furious, and seizing the young man they engage in a desperate encounter. The young man finally frees himself, and seizing a handful of eggs from the basket, begins pelting the old Rube with them. A very funny ending.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572912</url></doc>
