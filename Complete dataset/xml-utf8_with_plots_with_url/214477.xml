<plot>Danish version of the international quiz show format "Power of 10", in which contestants have to guess the results of opinion polls taken in the general public. Two contestants first compete to come closest to the correct answer on a scale from 0 to 100 per cent. The contestant who first has three wins goes on to compete for prize money, aided by a a friend or family member as well as the opinions of the audience. With each of five rounds the interval the contestant is allowed for his guess shrinks from 40 per cent to 30, 20 and 10 until the final round, when the contestant must give a precise answer. (The question is the final round is the same as for the penultimate round so that the contestant's options are limited to the 10-percent interval already confirmed to be correct.) With each round, prize money increases in multiples of ten from 500 to 5 million Danish kroner, the largest in Danish quiz show history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214477</url></doc>
