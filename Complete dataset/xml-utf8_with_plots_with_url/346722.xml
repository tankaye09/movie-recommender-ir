<plot>Lucky Stroke follows the journey of twenty-five year old Rob Connolly and his close friend - wannabe Mixed Martial Arts fighting champion, Chris. The story begins as Rob suffers yet another loss at the horse track and is cornered by a mobbed-up, scalpel-happy dentist who's also a second rate loan shark. Rob, skips town and returns to his hometown to find his childhood hangout - his father's family friendly miniature golf course - in shambles and about to go out of business. Rob, in desperate need of money to keep his limbs intact and save his father's course, enters the Mini-Golf World Championships - a tournament he came within a shot of winning five years prior. Problems occur for Rob when his faithful coach falls ill and Rob is forced to go the Championships alone against his old cheating nemesis, Brad Smith. With everything on the line, Rob digs deep, beats back his inner-demons, and gets "lucky" along the way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346722</url></doc>
