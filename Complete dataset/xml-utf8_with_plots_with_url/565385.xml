<plot>Ram칩n Iglesias has plans to retire from his janitorial job, sell his house in a Long Island suburb and return to Puerto Rico with his wife and three sons. Unfortunately, he does not hold the deed to his house which was purchased through a verbal agreement, harping back to a different cultural tradition involving codes of honor and community. Javier, his oldest son, a college graduate who refuses to return to Puerto Rico, chastises him for being so foolish in his business dealings. Ram칩n seems stuck in a homeowner's limbo until Javier, who is constantly clashing with his family, has a change of heart and decides to help.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?565385</url></doc>
