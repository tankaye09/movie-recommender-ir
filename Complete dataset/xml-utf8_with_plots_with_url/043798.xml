<plot>Barely out of her teens, Eden is homeless and pregnant, searching for a clean box in which she will deliver her soon to be born child. As the film unfolds we journey back discovering how Eden became homeless. Are the apples she distributes to the homeless people in the park an act of compassion or is it really forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge that ultimately leads Eden to a point of no return? The film sets hope, compassion against violence and intolerance between the town's people and the homeless.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043798</url></doc>
