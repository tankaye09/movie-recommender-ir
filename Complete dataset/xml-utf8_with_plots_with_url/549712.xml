<plot>Donald Griffith is a fraud in every respect. Not only is he cheating on his wife - with both his personal assistant and his firm's caterer - he has defrauded his clients out of millions of pounds. He is arrested at his firm's Christmas party but is soon released on bail. He knows he will go to jail for fraud and has few options. When he is found the next day floating in his swimming pool the police must determine if it was suicide or whether his wife, one of his mistresses or an irate client did him in. Assistant Commissioner Les Branton, whose sister lost all of her investments, asks Commander Clare Blake to take charge of the investigation. When the autopsy reveals that he did not drown, the police know they have a murder investigation on their hands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549712</url></doc>
