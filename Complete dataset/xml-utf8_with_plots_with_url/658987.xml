<plot>It's been 10 years since a devastating nuclear war destroyed most of Earth. Many people managed to initially survive the fallout. But as radioactive poisons began to pollute the air, many fell prey to the toxic fumes, despite the efforts to churn out enough anti-radioactivity medicine to combat the lethal clouds. Today, only a handful of people remain, struggling to survive in government-created fallout shelters, waiting for the radioactive poisons to dissipate. One man has survived. He continues to search for any signs of humanity despite the mounting odds against him. His name is John. His determination is one of the few things keeping him going despite numerous obstacles and a dwindling supply of medication. Fruitlessly, he searches for any signs of life. A tattered newspaper informs him of a nearby fallout shelter. He approaches the shelter hoping for supplies, if not another human. What John finds ultimately leaves him forever changed. "With Nothing Left" combines fresh ingenuity and state-of-the-art digital technology with the story and elements of a passionate drama. The film accurately portrays the scourge of war where there are no real winners, and provides a startling window into a possible future. The film stars Adam Maslak as John, a survivor of fate searching for humanity who realizes what he must lose in order to find what he is truly searching for. Mike Rudden portrays Pierce, a family man who comes to play a large part in John's search for redemption. He saw himself as one of the lucky ones-initially. In scouting locations, the filmmakers did not need to go far from home. The movie was filmed at a variety of location in the Marquette area, including sites on the Northern Michigan University campus as well as a deserted mine site in Negaunee, Michigan. It may not be an exotic location, but the rolling landscapes of Upper Michigan made it ideal. All of the editing, including voice-overs and green screen was done in the XELA Film offices in Marquette.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658987</url></doc>
