<plot>Born female but raised as a male for twenty-eight years, Sam Durbin experienced unspeakable abuse, never learned to read or write, and drifted in and out of institutions. His uncontrollable behavior and disheveled state led doctors to declare him a "hopeless case". When he found Integrity House, a clubhouse for people with disabilities in Orange County, he learned to read, write, and advocate for himself, eventually becoming a published author and nationwide advocate for people with disabilities. Despite his successes, his past continues to affect him in profound ways-from how he trusts people to his own self-image.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652902</url></doc>
