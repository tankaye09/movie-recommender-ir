<plot>"Paralyzed at 17" is the true story of a typical, invincible teenager's mistake (the same mistake many teenagers make) that left him permanently paralyzed, and his struggle to overcome severe adversity to heal the pain he caused himself and his family. Like many teenagers, he had a love/hate relationship with his parents and rebelled against them, because he couldn't understand why they were so strict on him, but the moment his parents walked into his intensive care unit and saw him paralyzed and barely alive, he finally understood that all they were trying to do was protect him from this. This film saves kids' lives by helping them understand ... BEFORE it's too late for them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423254</url></doc>
