<plot>Sita, a Girl from Jambu reveals how uneducated, rural Nepalese girls are tricked and lured into sexual slavery. Focusing on one girl's journey into the brothels of Mumbai, the film is an adaptation of a street play performed by rural Nepalese girls, whose performance is also featured in the film. This innovative blend of documentary and fiction both expands our notion of cinematic genre and extends the broader social message that people can make a difference in their communities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499262</url></doc>
