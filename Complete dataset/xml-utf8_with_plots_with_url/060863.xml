<plot>Imagine having the absolute worst day of your life only to find out that it could actually get even worse. That's what happens to Sierra after he abusive husband hits her for the first time in public. Hurt and ashamed, she seeks refuge in an upstairs bathroom only to get locked in there with Anita, a woman who represents everything Sierra dislikes. Stuck in the confined space together, the two women are forced to co-exist and soon realize that there may be more to each of them than meets the eye.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060863</url></doc>
