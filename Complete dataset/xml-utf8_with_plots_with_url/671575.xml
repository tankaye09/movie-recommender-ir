<plot>A real life event - set in 1960 we follow the departure of 18 year old Zohra, from Karachi to London looking for opportunity and "a better life at her Majesty's invitation". We follow her as she arrives to a decrepit hole of a flat, which she sees as a "beautiful paradise". Zohra and her 2 brothers discover that promises of Britain's 'better life' are greatly exaggerated, listening to their landlords claims of living within a film star's paradise off the King's Road. Zohra than sets off to look for some groceries. Her first walk down the Kings Road allows her to dream about her mother's cooking back home in Karachi, her sudden independence and ....the opera! Arriving at the Green-grocers she meets Dave, a Grocer -a self appointed playboy of the neighborhood. She soon assumes this Green Grocer is trying to take advantage of her..... Zohra soon discovers the chasm of cultural gap between Pakistan and Britain but also finds solutions on how the gap can eventually be bridged.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?671575</url></doc>
