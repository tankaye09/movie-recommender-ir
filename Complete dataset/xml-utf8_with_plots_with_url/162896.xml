<plot>Dying to Leave is a two-part series exploring one of the shadows of globalisation- the current worldwide boom in illicit human smuggling and human trafficking. Every year, an estimated three to four million people are shipped in containers, shepherded through sewage pipes, secreted in car chassis, and ferried across frigid waters. Others travel on legitimate carriers but with forged documents. An alarming number of these migrants end up in bondage, forced to work as prostitutes, thieves, or as labourers in sweatshops. By listening to the voices of those who pulled up their roots, who risked all, the series puts a human face on what might otherwise be seen as statistical, overwhelming, and remote. Dying to Leave looks at the circumstances that drove five migrants from their homes, describes the difficulties involved in their epic journeys, and reveals their lives in a new world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162896</url></doc>
