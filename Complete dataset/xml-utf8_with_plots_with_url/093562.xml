<plot>Before the construction of the White Pass &amp; Yukon Ry., there were thousands of dollars worth of supplies lost in these rapids every year, and that many lives also were here sacrificed to the Yellow God, is attested by the little grave yard not far from its banks, where lie the bodies of 19 victims that have been recovered from time to time. Our picture is a swinging one of Capt. Allard, the famous Alaskan voyager, performing the perilous feat of shooting these treacherous rapids, in a 14-foot skiff. The skiff is canvas-decked, and the necessity for this precaution is realized as the little skiff with its intrepid pilot is seen to be swallowed by the turbulent element, only to reappear and ride to the crest of the rolling torrent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093562</url></doc>
