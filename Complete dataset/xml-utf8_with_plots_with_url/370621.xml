<plot>Florence Kennedy (Florence Lake) discovers a mouse in the kitchen and Edgar (Edgar Kennedy) is attempting to capture it. Edgar has a butter knife after the mouse when Florence's mother (Dot Farley) and brother (Jack Rice) come by the kitchen, and they think Edgar is after Florence and call the police. After getting his fingers caught in some mouse traps, Edgar resorts to a shotgun and, of course, blows a hole in the wall. The police appear just as Edgar is plastering up the wall, find Florence's apron in the plaster and believe he has killed her. The situation is resolved by Florence's more-than-timely entrance but, after the police depart, they think the cat has been sealed in the wall and Edgar has to break the plaster again. Before long, Edgar has all the fingers on one hand caught in mouse traps, and uses the other for a slow-burn exit wipe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370621</url></doc>
