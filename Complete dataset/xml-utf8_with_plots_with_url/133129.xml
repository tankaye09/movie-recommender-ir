<plot>It was the best of times... When Tim Marsh has a chance encounter with old high school buddy Don White, his life changes forever. Tim and his wife Wendy quickly find themselves drawn into Don's world, a dizzying orgy of exclusive parties, exotic cars and beautiful women. In the hills high above Hollywood, life is a party that never stops. For Tim, who has struggled since high school, the good times are alluring and seductive. But the good times are not what they seem. As the Marsh's are sucked deeper and deeper into Don's world, they soon discover that they cannot go back. Manipulation and seduction lead to blackmail, deception, and before long, a brutal murder. Tim finds himself at the center of a murder investigation and elaborate insurance scheme involving Don's wife. Dead By Dawn is a cautionary tale about the intoxicating effects of power, money and sex.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133129</url></doc>
