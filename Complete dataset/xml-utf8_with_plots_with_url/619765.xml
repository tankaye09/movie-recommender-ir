<plot>A new and powerful documentary exposes the truth behind the "Keep Texas Moving" advertising campaign. This special edition chronicles the events and shocking developments leading to a landmark lawsuit. In a David and Goliath battle, Terri and her attorney Charlie Riley, fight against all odds to halt the Texas Department of Transportation from spending taxpayer funds to promote the TTC and toll roads. The plan is not only to convert existing Texas roadways into toll ways without a public vote, but to seize over half a million acres of Texas soil and replace it with a 4,000 mile road, rail and utility network. The Trans-Texas Corridor, the first leg of the proposed NAFTA superhighway, will not only rip the heart out of Texas- it will kill a way of life that has been in the Lone Star State forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619765</url></doc>
