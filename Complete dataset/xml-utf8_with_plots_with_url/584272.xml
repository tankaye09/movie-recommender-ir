<plot>THE PRIZE OF THE POLE The Prize of the Pole is a documentary dealing with three men and their life-long attempts to reconcile the opposing cultural ties within them. The story unfolds in the tension between Robert E. Peary, the American who spent 23 years among the polar Eskimos in order to conquer the North Pole, and Minik, sole survivor of six Eskimos, which Peary in 1897 put on exhibit in New York. In the film's contemporary level, the young polar Eskimo Robert E. Peary II, a great-grandchild of the arctic explorer, goes on an expedition into his ancestor's history, which takes him from Greenland, to America. An amazing history unfolds which changes Robert's view of himself and his ancestors forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584272</url></doc>
