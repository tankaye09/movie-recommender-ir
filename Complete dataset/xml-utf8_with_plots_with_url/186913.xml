<plot>FBI KKK is a personal documentary about my father, Dargan, an FBI agent, and the intersection of his life with George Dorsett, the highest ranking member of the UKA that secretly provided information to the FBI under a program called COINTELPRO WHITE HATE. This was a counter intelligence program: the goal was create a coordinated program to neutralize the Klan. Dorsett's first KKK job was as the head preacher and fund raiser for the UKA, but soon he was also on the FBI payroll. The bureau's success against the Klan was a product of agents' ability to grasp the motivations of everyday Klansmen. By 1967, my dad engineered the formation of the Confederate Knights of the KKK as a splinter group and set Dorsett up as the head, an FBI tactic used to divide and conquer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186913</url></doc>
