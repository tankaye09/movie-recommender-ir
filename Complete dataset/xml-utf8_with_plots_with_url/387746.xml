<plot>This is a documentary feature about J端rgen Bartsch, who killed four young boys in the early 60s, being between 15 and 19 years of age. The German press and public labeled him "beast" at that time because he tortured the boys, and chopped their bodies up after killing them. The film consists of interview footage from people who knew Bartsch, and you hear Bartsch himself talking about himself and his crimes; taken from tapes recorded by analysts while he was imprisoned. The film shows that Bartsch was not only a killer, but also a victim.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?387746</url></doc>
