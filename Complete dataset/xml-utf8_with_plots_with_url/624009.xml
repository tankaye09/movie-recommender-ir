<plot>"Shows the gunboat 'Castine,' assembled with the fleet in the Dry Tortugas. The view is taken from a steam launch, which approaches and passes the vessel. The decks are filled with sailors and marines, while the gunners are shown leaning over the guns from the various port-holes. The flag which is trailing from the stern is very large, and as it waves in the breezes produces a fine effect. In the background is seen the sidewheeler 'Whitney.' The picture is sharp and clear."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624009</url></doc>
