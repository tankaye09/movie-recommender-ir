<plot>Sixteen years ago, Vincenzo Romano left his wife, Francesca, and his two daughters, Bianca and Alessia, without saying a word. Today, the three women are at home, holding a closed-casket, private funeral for the man Francesca says is Vincenzo. The unusual ceremony, interspersed with vignettes from their lives, reveals the utter lack of communication between the three protagonists and their radically opposed natures. Francesca, always hardworking and devoted to others, has made her best to make this the perfect funerary service. Bianca, a selfish and whimsical girl who loathes their precarious economic situation and frequently clashes with her mother, could not care less for the funeral. Alessia, terribly timid and seemingly lost in her own world, does not say a word. The funeral is suddenly interrupted by the totally unexpected sound of the doorbell. On the other side of the door stands a man that claims to be Vincenzo, back for good and sorry for everything. The film, going back and forward in time over the course of a year and until the fateful funeral day, is told three times from the perspective of each of the three women, united and divided at the same time by the man that abandoned them sixteen years earlier. A dark take on the nature of human beings and their relationships, "I migliori sentimenti" exists in a universe where nothing is quite what it originally seemed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254198</url></doc>
