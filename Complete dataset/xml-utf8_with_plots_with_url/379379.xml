<plot>Popular British children's animation series, repeated almost constantly since 1971. Mr Benn is the ordinary, bowler-hatted office worker who lives in the ordinary suburban street of Festive Road. However, when he tries on a costume in a mysterious costume shop, he steps out of the changing room into a different time and place, appropriate to his apparel. His adventures include him being a Spaceman, a Pirate and an American Indian.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379379</url></doc>
