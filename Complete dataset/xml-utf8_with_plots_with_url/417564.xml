<plot>This unique and thought-provoking documentary delves into the conflict between the art and business of filmmaking as it is enacted on the "battlefield" of Hollywood. Through a series of interviews with people working in all aspects of the movie industry - from films with budgets ranging from $20,000 to multi-million dollar projects, to people who are struggling to become a "player" in the business, Swiss writer/director Michael Beltrami takes an incisive, hard-hitting look at a medium where artistic vision must often conform to the dictates of business.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417564</url></doc>
