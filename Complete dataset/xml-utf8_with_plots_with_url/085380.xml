<plot>"During the great blizzard of 1899, the railroads of northern New York were buried in snow for days, and it became necessary to use giant rotary snowplows in order to keep the tracks clear. After encountering innumerable difficulties and undergoing great exposure our operator succeeds in getting a magnificent picture of one of these huge snowplows coming through a twenty-foot drift. The plow is pushed by two of the heaviest type of locomotives and throws the snow with great velocity hundreds of feet through the air away from the tracks. The plow is seen coming directly toward the camera, affording a picture of great spectacular force."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085380</url></doc>
