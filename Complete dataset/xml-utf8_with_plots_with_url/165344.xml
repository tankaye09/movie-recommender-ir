<plot>Edward Leedskalnin set out on an enormous quest to create a monument to his lost love out of 1,100 tons of coral rock. Something that makes what Ed. L. did so remarkable, is the fact that he was just over 5 feet tall and weighed only 100 pounds. The coral that he worked on was up to a 1,000 feet thick. This documentary touches the lives of people that knew Ed when he was creating this incredible castle. The castle's walls and gates prove his private nature. In 1940, after the carvings were in place, Ed finished erecting the walls. The coral Walls approximately weigh 125 pounds per cubic foot. Each section of wall is 8 feet tall, 4 feet wide, 3 foot thick, and weighs more than 58 tons!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165344</url></doc>
