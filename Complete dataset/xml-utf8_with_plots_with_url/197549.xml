<plot>In this "Flickers Flashback" series of shorts (number one of the 1947-48 production season) Richard Fleischer chops up two silent films---both by editing and commentary---in the usual parody-burlesque fashion of this series aimed at gaining laughs at the expense of silent films originally intended as dramas. Since the running time of these shorts was ten minutes, and the original running time of the silent films used was also about ten minutes, or one reel, then close to half of the original footage was used. "Flicker Flashbacks" might be a good place to look for parts of "lost" silents. The two used here are "The Last Deal", a 1910 Biograph film directed by D. W. Griffith, that featured Owen Moore as a family man about to lose everything due to his gambling addiction; and a 1911 IMP production directed by Thomas H. Ince, "Behind the Stockade," in which Mary Pickford and Owen Moore (again) are starred in a film set on an African jungle plantation, with a stockade, a setting that pretty well disclaims the Western genre attributed to this film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197549</url></doc>
