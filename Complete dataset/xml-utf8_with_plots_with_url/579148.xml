<plot>Three sets of recently married spouses are the contestants on a game show. In one round, husbands are sent backstage while their wives answer questions, and then the husbands return and earn points for correctly guessing how their wives answered. The tables are turned in the next round with the husbands giving their answers first, followed by the wives earning points for correctly guessing their husbands' answers. The couple with the best combined score wins a trip and faces off against a "Goldywed" couple - a married couple who competed on a prior version of the game in an earlier decade - for a bonus prize.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579148</url></doc>
