<plot>Shannon Larkin is the explosive drummer of the band Godsmack. His distinct approach to drumming and ballistic stage presence have made him a dominant force in arenas and in the studio. Larkin gives an intimate behind-the scenes look at his life as a professional musician - including rare photos and video footage. Larkin then gives in-depth drum lessons for how to play "Straight Out of Line" and "Voodoo" by Godsmack and jams the tracks with Godsmack bassist Robbie Merrill.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063801</url></doc>
