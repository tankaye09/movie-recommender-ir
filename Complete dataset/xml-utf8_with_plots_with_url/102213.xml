But her aunt would like to see her married to her nephew, Ramu alias Romeo, and she has Jagatnarayan recruit him to teach Sarita music. Jagatnarayan himself would like Sarita to get married to the son of a wealthy man, Moti Lal, and openly rejects any alliance with Arun, who comes from a poor family.
