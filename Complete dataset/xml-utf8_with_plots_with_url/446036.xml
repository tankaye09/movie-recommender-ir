<plot>Project: Freshman features new students Elliott Winter, Sarah Riordan and Brianna "Bri" Lagat-Ramos, as they embark on college life at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Exclusively sponsored by AT&amp;T, each student was given a video camera to document their personal experience - the good, the bad and the ugly. For 13 weeks, Project: Freshman will showcase the lives of these three teens from different parts of the country, as they begin their first semester away from home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446036</url></doc>
