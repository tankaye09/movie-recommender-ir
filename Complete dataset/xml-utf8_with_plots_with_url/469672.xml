<plot>The city at night is a place where people wander, some because of sorrow, others because they seek love and adventure. The city by night is shown from the point of view of two taxi drivers, a man and a woman, both of whom have landed in this job because of life problems. The taxi drivers have an additional job for which no one pays: they must hear out other people's problems, while they keep their own to themselves. They drive around city all night, meeting people who are a reflection of the place and time in which they live.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469672</url></doc>
