<plot>Football has been a major staple of arcade video games since the 1978 release of Atari's "Football." While earlier games such as "10-Yard Fight" focused on traditional football, "NFL Blitz" upped the ante by applying a "no holds barred" attitude to the sport many watched on Sunday afternoon. All the current National Football League teams were represented. The basic object was still there ... score more points than your opponent; like all other video football games, a player could select from a menu of offensive, defensive and special teams plays. However, pass interference, late hits, roughing the kicker, taunting and professional wrestling-style maneuvers were allowed and encouraged. An off-screen announcer called the action. Other twists on the traditional game: Only seven players on the field, 30 yards were required for a first down and quarters lasted two minutes (with statistics listed after halftime). Like the arcade game, players could enter a special PIN number to keep track of statistics and use a "season mode" feature; the home game also allowed players to adjust such things as game length and skill level of the computer-controlled team.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?386901</url></doc>
