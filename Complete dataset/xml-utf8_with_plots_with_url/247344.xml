<plot>Twenty-four hours with Danny, a twenty-seven year old man whose life has reached an impasse. He finds himself unable to communicate with those around him as they force feed him various irrelevant details from their lives. In a bustling city he's never by himself but he's always alone. As each hour passes, so does another pointless, banal and unsatisfying moment in Danny's life. Nothing he does will help him connect with anyone else, even if he's sharing an office, sharing a house or sharing a bed. He is trapped in a repetitive cycle of monotony and mediocrity. Danny needs a way out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247344</url></doc>
