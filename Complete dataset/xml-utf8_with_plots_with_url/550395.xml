<plot>Boxer Johnny McKinney has come along to the point where he is ready to fight for the championship. His new bride, Betty, asks Johnny for $5,000. Johnny thinks the money is for her, but in reality it is to pay off her brother's gambling debts. In any event, Johnny doesn't have the money, and when his manager refuses to lend it to him, Johnny breaks up with him. Just as the big fight is coming up, Johnny breaks his hand. But in hopes of winning the money his wife needs, Johnny goes into the ring anyway. But surprises await him, inside the ring and out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550395</url></doc>
