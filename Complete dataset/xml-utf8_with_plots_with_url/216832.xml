<plot>Glazed is the story of listless veteran, Bill Malone. The beleaguered vet sits in the dark chain smoking cigarettes, and begins to recount the events of one terrible day he can never forget or forgive. With an unknown guilt he describes a Viet Nam as he remembers it, scary and alone. Through his raw and haunting words, we are taken back to the day where his friends were all massacred. Shots ring out in the jungle as a terrible firefight roars in the distance. Bill runs to aid his comrades, but is too late. His friends are dead and now it is he who is hunted. Alone and without any remaining ammunition, Bill must face his demon or be consumed by it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216832</url></doc>
