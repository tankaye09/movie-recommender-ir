<plot>This picture shows a column of 1,500 men, one of the finest bodies of men in all Europe ever collected together in one regiment. Their striking uniforms and helmets, the steel-tipped lances they carry, the magnificent horses they ride, their elegant trappings, the majestic manner in which they ride, make this picture one of the most desirable and valuable of our military. The column is led by a military band on horseback.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010880</url></doc>
