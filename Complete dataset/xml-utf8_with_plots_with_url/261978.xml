<plot>Given a choice, what parent wouldn't pick good health for their baby, over a life-threatening disease? Science is making that choice possible for a growing list of genetic conditions. That's the good news. The bad news is the choices aren't always so clear-cut and may change how society deals with people who are perceived as 'different'. This film discloses the challenges faced by families with hereditary disorders, who must now decide what parents just a generation ago couldn't even imagine--whether or not to have a child "in their own image." It's a rare glimpse into what the future has in store for the rest of us as tests reveal more and more about what's in our genes. In Our Own Image follows two couples planning the birth of a child who may inherit their own genetic condition (dwarfism in one case, cystic fibrosis in the other). For them, these are life-or-death questions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261978</url></doc>
