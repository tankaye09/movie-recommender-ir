<plot>Ben Sheffield returns to his small hometown of Heatley Bay on the Canadian west coast as the new Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) officer. He and his mother - recently deceased - left the town when he was two years old after his father died. Ben or his mother had never returned to Heatley Bay until now. He is to work with existing Heatley Bay DFO officer Mary Leonard. Mary purports to be an old friend of his mother's, although his mother never mentioned Mary to him. Many in town knew of him and also knew his mother, including John Croat, who is known to the locals as Luther. Luther lives in the Sheffield home and just won't leave the house even after Ben arrives to assume possession. Kyle Jenkins also knows of Ben, Kyle's father who killed Ben's father in a drunken fight. A young man, Kyle mentally is no longer the man he once was after a work accident. Not provided with disability pay, Kyle survives by beach combing and conducting petty crimes, which the townsfolk tolerate. On a routine investigation of crab trap poaching along remote Cable Beach, Mary and Ben come across what looks to be the murder of a male tourist. The male tourist is discovered to be Warren Seaton, a former resident of the area. Kyle tells the story of Warren and his wife, Rachel, kayaking in the area and stumbling onto his camp. Kyle does admit injuring Warren during a physical altercation, but that Warren and Rachel wandered off after that. After Ben locates Rachel and gets her story, she tells a slightly different one that implicates Kyle for murder. But Ben's life in Heatley Bay, including conducting the murder investigation, becomes a little more clear when he learns more about his mother and Mary's past friendship, and why Cable Beach holds such a mystical place in their life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089972</url></doc>
