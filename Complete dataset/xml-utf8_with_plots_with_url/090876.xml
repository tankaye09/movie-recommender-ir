<plot>In and near the city of Los Angeles, there are 945 oil wells in operation. In this picture we present a pnaoramic view running through the oil field. Throughout the resident portion of the city numerous derricks are located, and the gardens of many of the residences have developed into rich wells, making fortunes for the owners of such property. This picture was taken from the front of a trolley car running out Temple street to Elysian Park, Los Angeles, and during the trip we pass by hundreds of oil wells in active operation, pumping the petroleum from a depth of 1,500 feet into the tanks above. This is interesting as a subject of education and is also an excellent panoramic view.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?090876</url></doc>
