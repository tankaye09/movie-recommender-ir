<plot>This political satire charts the night before Christmas where an aimless "jive talking, dancing" pimp, happens onto Santa's death, by his transvestite "star"hooker, who's also his true love, Rooty the red-nosed crack ho. He uses Santa's magic to act out all the stereotypes one could imagine from drug running to breaking and entering, until he happens onto his little bright, white savior, Billy Joe Ho, who's kind gentle heart changes the pimp from "dark" threat to enlightened savior of Christmas. With the help of his eight ho's and a coked-up rooty pulling his broken down pimp mobile, the Pimp saves Christmas for all of Ho-ville.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248412</url></doc>
