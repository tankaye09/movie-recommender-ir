<plot>Popeye is leaving on his sailing ship, much to Olive's chagrin. She ends up accidentally stowing away in a trunk. Popeye discovers her, but she can't stay, because the crew will think she's a jinx. She tries to hide, but this only scares the crew more, because they think the ship's haunted. When she is revealed, the crew comes after her to throw her off, and then turns on captain Popeye. He eats his spinach, throws them all in the cargo hold, and still throws Olive off, into a dinghy, because he still thinks she's a jinx.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382859</url></doc>
