<plot>Tommy is an average teenager, but he can't punctuate worth a darn, and doesn't see any need to worry about it. He writes a letter to his father that is completely devoid of any punctuation at all. His dad thinks it's humorous, but begins to worry about Tommy, because his letters will soon be read by "more critical correspondents." As if to drive the point home, two teenage girls read a letter Tommy had written and laugh uproariously at it, dismissing the writer as "childish" and saying that is exactly how girls would consider him. However, they soon read a letter from Tommy that is correctly punctuated, and begin to smile and swoon about what a "right guy" he is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655849</url></doc>
