<plot>According to myth they ruled the sea a thousand years ago: daring seafarers, bloodthirsty savages, pillagers, mighty men of courage and passion - in short, Vikings. But Loggerheads has no part of these mighty warriors. Instead it corrects historical reporting and portrays the Vikings the way they really were: 'nice' people, neither blond nor blue eyed, with nothing better to do in their remote fjord than to get on each other's nerves. Bjorn and Gissur are two vain and cunning Vikings who battle for supremacy as chief of the village of Loggerheads, home to a truly breathtaking collection of misfits. This fast-moving and funny animated series follows their fights and feuds, business and love affairs, struggles between opposite sexes, religions and nationalities and their problems with divorces, taxes, youngsters, giants, tourists, dragons, babies, whales and pirates.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340356</url></doc>
