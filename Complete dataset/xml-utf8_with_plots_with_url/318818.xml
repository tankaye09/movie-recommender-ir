<plot>Rambling cowhand Johnny Mack (Johnny Mack Brown)learns that his friend Henry Blake has been killed, and he agrees to help law-abiding citizens clean up Medicine Flats. This is after he has thwarted an attempt by Yuma (Marshall Reed) and two henchmen to hold up prospector Bodie (Raymond Hatton) and jump his unrecorded mining claim. Kansas City Kate (Christine McIntyre), runs the notorious Golden Spur Saloon, and heads the outlaws along with Cameo (Tristram Coffin), a gambler paying to much interest to saloon singer Donna Webster (June Harrison). Donna;s warning saves Johnny from being shot by Yuma, after the latter is beaten up by Johnny for molesting an old townsman character. Plans by the outlaws to ship a hoard of money stolen from the miners and settlers is overheard by Bodie from a hideaway in the basement beneath the saloon. Johnny and the vigilantes intercept the stagecaoch and the money bag, and obstruct numerous other schemes by the gang. Bodie is shot by Yuma after Cameo discovers his hiding place and Johnny kills Yuma in retaliation. He nips Kate's plans to protect the Golden Spur by hiring the Cherokee Kid (I. Stanford Jolley) and his desperadoes. Donna reveals that she is the daughter of Henry Blake, after Kate and Cameo confess to his slaying. His job done, Johnny again heads for the open road ahead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318818</url></doc>
