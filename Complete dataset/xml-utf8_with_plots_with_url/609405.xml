<plot>Greg Roman performs eight numbers as Titler, a cross-dressing man with a woman's figure and the hair and mustache of the Fuhrer's. His dress is sleeveless: his muscular arms add to the effect. Most are familiar tunes with Titler's own lyrics: "Matchmaker, Matchmaker" becomes a song about performers of fellatio and cunnilingus. The lyrics are camp, and some have gay and lesbian themes. It's set in an abandoned and decaying state hospital, shot in sepia: in a yard, a boiler room, a high-ceilinged hall, and against a wire fence. It dissolves to black between each tune. A small dog, a friend in a wheelchair, and a fur stole are props in a few numbers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?609405</url></doc>
