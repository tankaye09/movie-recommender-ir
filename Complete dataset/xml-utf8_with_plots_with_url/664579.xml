<plot>Sapna, the daughter of the Saigal family's driver is a simple fun-loving girl, but her dreams are not as simple. She dreams about riches and day-dreams about her dream man. Vijay Saigal and Vicky Saigal, both heirs to Saigal Industries have almost all the qualities of a dream man. Almost. Because "All work and no play" makes Vijay a dull boy and "All play and no work" makes Vicky and outrageous flirt, as he does not believe in the affairs of the hearts, but only in affairs. But then even Sapna is not made of the stuff, dream girls are made of. Not until she becomes a successful model and transforms into a beautiful girl. That's when she become Vicky's dream girl. But Sapna's success hasn't changed her status. She is still the driver's daughter and Mrs. Shanti Devi may overlook her son's affairs with rich girls but not with a driver's daughter. Big brother Vijay takes upon himself to iron out the differences, but himself gets smothered by Sapna's live-wire charm and subsequently her beauty dazzles him and he finds himself falling in love with her. In this complex situation, fun takes a dramatic exit from the lives of these fun-loving people and love becomes a serious business. Serious to the extent that one brother is ready to give his life for love and the other is ready to sacrifice his love for brother's life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664579</url></doc>
