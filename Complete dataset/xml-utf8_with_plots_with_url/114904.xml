<plot>In Prague, a young man pursues a devout, beautiful woman. He compulsively watches her daily at Mass, but cannot muster the courage to speak to her. Just as he makes an overture to begin a conversation, he is interrupted by the startling prostrations and moans of a supplicant who becomes a competitor for the woman's affections. Wracked with jealousy, Kafka's character confronts the supplicant. This encounter results in the narrator's fracturing into multiple identities, perhaps confronting his own shadow or innermost psyche. It is unclear which characters are real and which are ghostly inner encounters. It's a quest for spiritual and mental wholeness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114904</url></doc>
