<plot>A man stands in a long line. He is perturbed by the wait, but has a secret; he has forgotten why he's in line. Upon sharing his secret with the person in front of him, an interesting dilemma presents itself. Neither one can remember. They both decide to set out on a crusade to figure out what the line is for, but of course no one really remembers why they are there. They've all been there too long. Finally they decide to pass the question all the way up to the front of the line. At least the person at the front of the line must know. But when the answer finally comes back to them, it turns out to be completely over their heads.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?571186</url></doc>
