<plot>Set in the present time in the Windy City, we follow billionaire playboy Marco D'Koh, who has it all except one thing; the truth. Marco battles with a gap in his memory and having mysterious skills and a warrior marking that shouldn't be there. Soon his oblivious ties with the ancient warrior lineage put him and those he loves in danger. His help comes from a mysterious nomad protector who goes to prison as a result of protecting Marco. It is there that the Nomad must deal with Mr. Smiths, a corrupt and powerful Warden who is soon out for the Nomad's blood and soul. The Nomad's outside help comes from a single mom lawyer, who is battling her own demons. The question that keeps coming up is: who is Marco D'Koh? Who is he really? Marco knows that the answers lie within the mysterious nomad and that the means to getting to the nomad are through the single mother lawyer. This twist of fate puts an unlikely trio together to collectively fight to the very end both physically and spiritually.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457518</url></doc>
