<plot>This sex-education film is somewhat unusual in that, instead of being made for junior-high and high school students, it is made for second- and third-grade students. A teacher asks her students what they know about childbirth, and after they answer she shows them, via diagrams and illustrations, exactly how babies are made and how they are born.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249891</url></doc>
