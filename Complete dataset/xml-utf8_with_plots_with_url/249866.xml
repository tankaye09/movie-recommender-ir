<plot>Police Inspector Dinanath Verma arrests four men, Chakradhar, Bhootnath, Nainsukh, and Hunterwala, and holds them in a cell for trial in a court. They offer to bribe him a large sum of money, but he refuses. That night they escape, with the help of a corrupt Havaldar, go to Dinanath's house and kill him and his wife. Dinanath's sons, Ravi and Kamal, manage to escape. Years later, Ravi has grown up to be the Assistant Commissioner of Police, is in love and wants to marry Social-Worker, Rashmi, but has thus far been unable to apprehend his parents's killers. Kamal is a young collegian who is in love with Ritu. The Police Department is under pressure from Mantri, who wants them to solve the mystery of a modern day Robin Hood, who steals money and jewelery from the poor and re-distributes it to the poor. What the Police and Ravi do not know is that everyone directly involved with Ravi seems to have very close ties with this modern day Robin Hood. Watch what happens when Ravi himself is caught on video-tape assisting Robin Hood, and the impact this has on the community and the Police in particular.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249866</url></doc>
