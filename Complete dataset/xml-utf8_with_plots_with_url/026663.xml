<plot>Plane is a troubled cop who hits the skids when his girlfriend Carrie gets killed by a stoic hitman named Angel. One year later he finds himself saddled with new partner Turkey, an immature cop who's in love with up-and-coming idol singer Siu Lin. Turkey also has a wacky father who thinks he's James Bond and has tons of gadgets to prove it. There are the usual growing pains as the two partners learn to like and trust one another. Then things go bad when Angel returns to settle some scores. Figuring into this is Siu Lin, who catches a glimpse of Angel's face. Frightened, she enlists the help of computer expert Mandy. Mandy is a dead ringer for Carrie, and Plane falls head over heels as he discovers that Mandy is his 100% girl. What that means is that she's everything Carrie was, and even more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026663</url></doc>
