<plot>Numerous pictures have been made of lightning sketch artists and kindred pictures, but this film is entirely different from any ever attempted. An artist appears and proceeds to draw the face of a boy on the canvas. He no sooner draws the outline, than the face assumes life and makes grimaces at everybody. Our artist proceeds to draw a bottle of wine, a glass and a cigar which he takes from the canvas and makes use of in the "good old way." The face on the canvas takes exception to the treatment received at the hands of the artist and shows his displeasure by performing somersaults on the canvas; each time he turns he presents a different face. It will puzzle you to figure out how this is done and you will be free to admit that this is the best picture of its kind you ever saw. There is nothing objectionable in it; you can show it anywhere.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540371</url></doc>
