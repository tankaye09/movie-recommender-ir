<plot>The idea of "street photography," taking one's camera out into the world and shooting whatever catches one's attention, took on a special twist in the work of Bruce Gilden. His photographs are often records of his confrontations with his subjects, and the tension of the moment is as much a part of the final product as the light and shadows. Gideon Gold caught up with the wisecracking Gilden - described as a Damon Runyon of photographers - and provided a platform for Gilden to talk about his life, work, and ideas about photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?371793</url></doc>
