<plot>This is the story of Mario Rampolli, an Italian soldier trying to survive in the trenches during WWI. The movie explains how he got chosen for a dangerous mission one day, knowing he wouldn't survive. Once he realizes this terrible fate he falls into deep sadness, then anger and finally denial. He begs his sergeant to substitute him, then begs the other soldiers to go in his place. Only at the very end, just when he is preparing to go, he get's resigned from his dreadful duty and another soldier get's chosen in his place. In this strange moment of truth, Mario makes the most difficult decision of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617336</url></doc>
