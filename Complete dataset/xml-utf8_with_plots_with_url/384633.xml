<plot>Narrator 'John Nesbitt' (qv) visits his old hometown and reminisces about how much simpler things were there when he was growing up. He also says that he wouldn't want to visit that time again, because people tend to remember the good things but not the hardships. There is, however, one thing that the old and new versions of his hometown have in common: faith in the future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384633</url></doc>
