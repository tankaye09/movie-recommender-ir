<plot>Louis Pritchard has fallen on hard times. His wife has recently passed away making him sole owner and operator of their local corner store Family Food Market. The neighborhood where he lives and works is slowly deteriorating. He can barely make the rent on his home, let alone pay for his store. To make matters worse a large corporate super-store has moved into the area taking away the little business he had. His only hope of saving his store lies with the support of dedicated customers like his good friend Luke Evans, and his lucky numbers to the upcoming lottery jackpot.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346601</url></doc>
