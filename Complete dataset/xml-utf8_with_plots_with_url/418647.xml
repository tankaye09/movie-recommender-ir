<plot>"Outspoken - Los Angeles." Is a feature length documentary that focuses on both Veterans and civilians in Los Angeles that fight the American occupation of Iraq. It is not a documentary designed to find a solution for a very grand and global catastrophe; but designed to give those who dedicate their lives and are affected (personally) by this war an opportunity to speak out to a larger community about their personal views and struggles. "Outspoken - Los Angeles" will reach into the motives of how and why. Why are we outspoken? What lives deep in us that makes us feel as if we must? These are real stories of real people telling their truth. The international community has been shaken by the current events taking place in Iraq and other areas of the Middle East. American global empathy is reaching a staggering low. It is crucial that the International community be made aware that not all Americans are pro-war and pro-Bush.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418647</url></doc>
