<plot>Scene of action is Zürich airport. In most of the bigger airports in Europe nowadays there exist so called "zone d'atontés, spaces in which sans papiers, refugees, are kept, not knowing how long this condition will last. In most of the cases the journey back is inevitable. Such a room is the starting point of the story. In this context two men of African descent are prisoners as well as guards patrolling through the airport. The guards change the rules and present themselves now as those who rule over the territory of the airport. The protagonists are not representing a militaristic - police power, on the contrary, their determination is the consequence of loss of control. The Asian passenger, accidentally at the scene of action, in place of the viewer, gets in between the front lines.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026969</url></doc>
