<plot>This documentary seeks to examine interracial romantic relationships between blacks and whites in contemporary America through the lens of the basic question: Why is dating across racial lines still taboo? We seek to explore and explode stereotypes, myths, and beliefs held commonly by both races. Taboo employs the documentary style made popular by Michael Moore using the very talented Executive Producer as its onscreen narrator and host. Leslie boldly guides us through this hybrid documentary's journey featuring risk-taking vignettes and musical numbers to accent the in-depth interviews, verit√©, scholarly investigations and round table discussions. Entertaining, insightful, this doc and its host courageously ask difficult questions about surprising and controversial subjects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?528270</url></doc>
