Each of Joey's siblings agrees to speak with Joey's finacee, and proceeds to contradict and reveal each other's stories, secrets, and motives.Through the course of these interviews John glimpses the life Joey hid from him, and for all he comes to know, it is Eleanor who, as always, has the last word.
