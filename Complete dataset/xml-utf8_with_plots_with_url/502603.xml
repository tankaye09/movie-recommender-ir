<plot>Two self-help books, respectively titled "How to Get That Girl" and "How to get That Guy" are pushed upon Kayla and Paul. Kayla Marcum and Paul Rhodes are two shy and slightly awkward individuals, at least when it comes to the opposite sex. With the help of these books however, they are determined they will be able to get the other to notice them. They are willing to do whatever it takes to make this happen, including taking the advice of the books to the extreme. Whether or not they realize how far they go, that is another question entirely. Maybe these books are just what Kayla and Paul needed to bring them together all along, or maybe they will stay just as they are, smitten.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502603</url></doc>
