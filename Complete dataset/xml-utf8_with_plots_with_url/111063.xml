<plot>"The steamer 'Mascotte' has reached her dock at Port Tampa, and the 2nd Battalion of Colored Infantry is going ashore. Tide is very high, and the gang plank is extra steep; and it is laughable to see the extreme caution displayed by the soldiers clambering down. The commanding officer struts on the wharf, urging them to hurry. Two boat stewards in glistening white duck coats, are interested watchers looking for 'tips' perhaps. The picture is full of fine light and shadow effects."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111063</url></doc>
