<plot>Based on a true story. In love at last, Henry VIII wants to become the man his pregnant young wife believes him to be. After five stillborns and two daughters, however, he's also desperate for the male heir that will solidify his claim to the throne. In the end, he faces a choice: "Sire, the infant is male and it lives, but it lies in the wrong position. If we cannot turn it, who shall be saved, the mother or the son?"</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222337</url></doc>
