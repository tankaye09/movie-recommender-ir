<plot>All over the small, backwoods rural town of Grandeville, tacked to power poles and trees, taped to store windows, flyers have appeared announcing the one-night only performance of The Traveling Vampire Show. The promised highlight of the show is the gorgeous Valeria, the only living vampire held in captivity. For three local 16-year olds, two boys and a girl, this is a show they can't miss. Even though the flyers say no one under eighteen will be admitted, and to make matters even worse the show will take place at midnight at Janks Field, an abandoned open ground in the middle of the town forest with a terrible past and haunting memories, the teenagers are still determined to find a way in. What follows is a coming of age story of friendship and courage, temptation and terror, when three friends go where they shouldn't go, and find much more than they had ever expected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596855</url></doc>
