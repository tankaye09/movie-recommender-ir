<plot>A child plays teacher come newscaster presenting the difference between Neanderthals and Humans. A seemingly random collection of images flashes by in the lower right hand corner of the screen; like those irritating pop-ups on your favorite TV show. The images were downloaded from a Google search on "intelligent design". The juxtaposition of the child's narrative and the images is both hilarious and socially poignant. The piece surfaces issues of religion, race, humanity and ignorance. The project was inspired by the religious debate between creationism and evolution.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266676</url></doc>
