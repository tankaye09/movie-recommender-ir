<plot>When Jeff Diamond is unexpectedly laid off from his job, his wife Susan accepts an offer by her best friend Kathy to pay Jeff as an escort to a party. Kathy enjoyed Jeff so much she requests him again at a higher rate which includes sex. After being unsuccessful in locating a new job, Susan decides to continue booking escort appointments to make up the lost income. Soon Susan sets up the service as a business, and ends up making thousands of dollars. Jeff is unhappy but does it anyway for his wife. Eventually Jeff meets a wealthy woman, Denise, who falls for him. Jeff stays awhile, but runs back to his wife, and they take a well planned vacation, and live happily ever after.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260015</url></doc>
