<plot>Irfan Khan Iliyazi was born in a poor family in Bombay, India, the son of a railway coolie, who started his career as a pick-pocket. At the age of 17 when he was threatened by his opponent, he retaliated by killing him and scattering his body parts on nearby railway tracks. Thereafter Irfan went on become an underworld don as well starting dealing in drugs and narcotics, and acquiring multiple identities and passports from Mumbai, Indore, and Sultanate of Oman. On August 10 the Mumbai Police had him cornered at the airport while attempting to flee to Dubai, but in vain as Irfan escapes and re-locates to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Once there, he plans his escape by disguising himself and arranging the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kathmandu, Nepal, and thence making his way to Dubai. The Indian Police announces that they will reward anyone who apprehends Irfan dead or alive. Everything goes according to plan - until Irfan gets on the plane. This is where he will end up getting abducted by four naive and inexperienced youth - who want to better their individual lives - by holding him hostage and claim the reward anonymously. Watch what happens when the Police Officer, who these youth initially contact, happens to be on the payroll of Irfan and his associate, Musharraf.</plot><plot>Irfan Khan Iliyazi was born in a poor family in Bombay, India, the son of a railway coolie, who started his career as a pick-pocket.
