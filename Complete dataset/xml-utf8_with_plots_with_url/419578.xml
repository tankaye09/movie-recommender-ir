<plot>What moral and legal price are we willing to pay for our safety? This film examines the effect of street violence on our society. An elderly woman is brutally attacked and threatened by a gang during a heat wave. She barricades herself in her apartment and succumbs to the heat. The city files an injunction against the gang. Is the injunction warranted? Viewers at this permanent exhibit at the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles actually get to ask questions of the DA and a civil liberties lawyer to learn more about this problem.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419578</url></doc>
