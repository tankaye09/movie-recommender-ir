<plot>Two children own a castle full of stuffed and wooden toys, which sits on their drawers. When they sleep, the toys come to life, a la Toy Story and _Indian in the Cupboard, The (1995)_ (qv). Together, they learn facts about life through their misadventures. They include a British soldier, a French ballerina, a strong man with "Atlas" on his belt, a clown who makes a strange laughing noise, and a goblin. The characters never actually seem to talk, they sort of mime as a narrator explains their dialogue, often inanely switching using his ordinary voice and disguised voices (like accents or deepness). When the children awake, the toys bustle to get back in place and freeze in their positions as the children awake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596533</url></doc>
