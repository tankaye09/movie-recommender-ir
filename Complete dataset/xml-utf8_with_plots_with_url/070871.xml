<plot>BILLY ECKSTINE SINGS / DIZZY GILLESPIE SWINGS Two jazz giants on one DVD! Both were members of the legendary Earl "Fatha" Hines Orchestra, but one used lyrics to express himself; the other played trumpet. William Clarence Eckstein, better known as Billy Eckstine (or simply "Mr. B.") was the first romantic black male in pop music. His smooth baritone and distinctive vibrato crossed color barriers to make him one of the most popular singers of the 20th century. John Birks Gillespie, alias Dizzy. Like Billy Eckstein, he helped popularize the idiosyncratic style of modern jazz known as Be-Bop. Known for his onstage clowning and "bullfrog" style of puffing out his cheeks while he played, Dizzy Gillespie influenced generations of jazz musicians with his distinctive sound. No fan of jazz - and especially Be-Bop - should be without Billy Eckstine Sings / Dizzy Gillespie Swings!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070871</url></doc>
