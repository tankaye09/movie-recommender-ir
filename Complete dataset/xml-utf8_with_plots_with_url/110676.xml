<plot>This picture shows how they collect the mail in England. We seen an English train approaching at full speed, probably about 60 miles an hour, and collects the mail without stopping. The novelty of this film is that you see a thorough English train, with its compartments, as you have seen it described, and the landscape itself is pleasing to the eye.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110676</url></doc>
