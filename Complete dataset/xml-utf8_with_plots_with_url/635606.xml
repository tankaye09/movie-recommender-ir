<plot>A ballet of construction workers sublimely dances Tchaikovsky's Swan lake. Vals is Official Selection at Rainier Independent Film Festival 2007. Vals (Waltz) was created under an unusual set of circumstances. During three months, at the same time every morning, video was captured and edited following a strange set of actions and reactions executed in perfect synchronicity by construction workers in the midst of hard labor, often bordering futility and the inexplicable, such as move mud from one place to another. Vals can be dissected into layers, like peeling an onion or an artichoke. Beyond the obvious and hilarious contrast between the exquisite Swan's lake melody and the sweat pouring out from an intensive labor, rests a lesson of life. An accurate snapshot of the rigors demanded by existence in a modern society. Staged in a Caribbean island, far from the sophistication of other latitudes, Vals serves the purpose to remind us, that everyday life break backs and destroy souls.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?635606</url></doc>
