<plot>Adapted from Janet Wallach's acclaimed book, "Desert Queen: The Extraordinary Life of Gertrude Bell: Adventurer, Adviser to Kings, Ally of Lawrence of Arabia", the script tells the life story of British born, Gertrude Bell, one of the great tragic female figures of the 20th Century. With a sharp tongue, quick mind and a deep understanding of the people of the region's cultures, politics and passions, Gertrude masterminded the Arab Revolt (along with TE Lawrence) and ultimately created the boundaries of modern Iraq. Feeling alone and forgotten, she took her own life in the country that she had created at her home in Baghdad three days before her 58th birthday.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?141726</url></doc>
