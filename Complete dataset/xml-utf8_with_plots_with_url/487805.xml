<plot>On a cold and foggy morning, the ocean delivers a killer to a small island off the coast of Massachusetts. His arrival is seen only by a young girl trapped inside of a cage- a girl who will never be allowed to divulge the secrets of the man who has imprisoned her. The man calls himself Patrick, but his real identity is a mystery. To the law enforcement personnel who have tried to apprehend him, and to his unknown number of victims, he is, first and foremost, a dangerous psychopath. "Sever" is more than the typical genre version of a serial killer. It's a look into the mind and through the eyes of a schizophrenic killer. A man who has devoted his considerable skill and intelligence towards a horrific end that only he can understand- and which only a true independent horror film can show. From beginning to end, "Sever" will pull no punches, and it will not be forgotten as easily as most mainstream efforts are- first it will make you squirm, and then it will haunt you</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?487805</url></doc>
