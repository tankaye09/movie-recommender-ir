<plot>Born on the 17th of September in Uttar Pradesh, Vijay Rai leads a wealthy lifestyle along with his dad, Ajay Kumar, who are now settled in scenic Simla. Since Vijay is 25 years old, his dad wants him to get married, but Vijay wants to find his own soul mate. He does find her in Bombay-based Anju, both meet and fall in love with each other. When Anju is informed that her dad is ill, she returns home, and leaves a note for Vijay to contact her there. Upon receiving her note, Vijay departs for Bombay and reaches Anju's residence. He is received by her dad, Dinanath, who informs him that Anju has been dead for over 3 years now. A disbelieving Vijay, assisted by CBI Inspector Jayant Mathur, decides to trace Anju. He and Jayant do find her, but she claims that she has never met Vijay and identifies herself as Mona, a Goa-based dancer/singer. Vijay must now accept Anju's death and move on little knowing that if he persists he will soon be declared insane as none of the people he has come across thus far are who they claim to be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317274</url></doc>
