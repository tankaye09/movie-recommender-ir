<plot>Four contestants, seated around an electronic spinning arrow, answer questions as they build prize packages not exceeding $5,000. Each contestant is given a prize of unstated value at the beginning of the game. As each additional prize is announced, the host reads a question. The contestant who answers correctly gets to press a button stopping the electronic arrow; wherever it stopped, that contestant could either keep the prize or give it to an opponent. The contestant who won the most without exceeding $5,000 was champion and played a bonus game for more prizes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216506</url></doc>
