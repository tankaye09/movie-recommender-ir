<plot>"Missing Person" is the story of an estrangement-- told through the unreliable recollections of the abandoned man, Eddie. His wife Maria is missing. The key mystery is the capacity in which she may, or may not, be gone. Eddie is, figuratively speaking, as lost as his wife it seems and our two investigating detectives, Schmidt and Milton, are left, like the audience, to put together the pieces of his patchwork narrative. Things unravel like a poorly told lie until the story, like Eddie himself, no longer holds together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372469</url></doc>
