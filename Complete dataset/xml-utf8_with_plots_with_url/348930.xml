<plot>Six gruesome murders send a present-day New York City into a frenzy as serial killer The Crucifix Strangler strikes beautiful young Harlem women. Detective King and his rogue partner Detective Cassie Mars are the leads on the case and are under the microscope of the department. Once at the crime scene of the sixth victim Ellie Flores, Detective King must remind his scorned former lover Detective Monica Nunez who is in charge. Detectives King and Mars are later put on the hot seat by Captain Parsons to gather substantial evidence within twenty-four hours or Detective Nunez will take over. After questioning Ellie's parents, Detective King is led to St. Francis Church where his brother Father Aristotle King runs the parish and Ellie was a member and volunteer. The King brothers reunion is chilly, but quickly defrosts once Father King gives Detective King a crucial lead. Detectives King and Mars set off on a fast pace investigation, but things are turned upside down for Detective King once his brother admits to taking the confessions of a possible Crucifix Strangler suspect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?348930</url></doc>
