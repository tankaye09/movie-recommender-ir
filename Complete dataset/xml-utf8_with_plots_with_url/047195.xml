<plot>For Mark, average days consist of more time preparing to tackle life than actually tackling life. Mark suffers from OCD, a condition that has plagued all his adult life and essentially ruined any and all plans for love Mark could ever dream of. That's until Lisa, his co-worker, mistakes his awkward habits for quirkiness and decides to take a chance dating him. It turns out that Lisa happens to have her little 'quirks' too that may or may not add to or destroy their up-and-down relationship. In Mark's crusade to better himself he may in fact be just what his peers needed to save themselves before it's to late.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047195</url></doc>
