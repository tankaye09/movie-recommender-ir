<plot>Once upon a time there was a band called The Family Johnson, hyped as "the coolest band in New York City." But sadly, on the eve of its success, the band broke up, due to the lead singer's bad behavior. A year and a half later, former frontman Bugs, in rehab again, seeks to apologize to Shelly, his old friend and former bandmate. But Shelly, whose solo career is now taking off, has little time for Bugs. Aesop's Diner is a heartbreakingly humorous fable of "fast and careless" vs. "slow and steady" set to a stunningly beautiful, upbeat original soundtrack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024547</url></doc>
