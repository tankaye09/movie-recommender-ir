<plot>Once an international jetsetter and creative mastermind of the dotcom era, Julie has given up on getting a job and has turned to shooting cocaine, full-time. When she is not in the welfare line, she wanders the streets of San Francisco, scribbling ironic cries for help on the walls of the city, but help is the last thing she wants. She has the sunniest disposition of any self-confirmed nihilist you're ever likely to meet, riffing on pessimistic tirades, and nightmarish personal confessions with the detachment of a TV weathergirl. Julie's sidewinding spiral takes her - and drags us - from glamour to gutter: from crack alleys and strip-bar bathrooms to a strange stint as a New Orleans public school art teacher. Filmmaker Molly Lynch graphically chronicles her subject's journey through harsh days and scary nights, infusing the film with surreal montages and musings on demonic possession, self-expression and American drug policy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224087</url></doc>
