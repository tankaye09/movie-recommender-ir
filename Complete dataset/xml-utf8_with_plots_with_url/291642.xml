<plot>Bishop was the world's first super-soldier: a man equipped with powerful nanotechnology that keeps him in contact with a "supervisor" while in the field. Combined with his own impressive natural abilities, Bishop was truly a one-man army. But something has gone wrong. Shortly after the death of his newlywed wife, Bishop disappeared, only to resurface later in the Middle East, Russia, and North Korea. Each time, he defeated all resistance and upset the delicate balance of world power. What happened to Bishop? Why is he attacking these installations? If someone doesn't find the answer soon, Bishop might just become the world's kill switch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291642</url></doc>
