<plot>With Ben out of work and one salary to lean on, financial difficulties quietly tear Ben and Julia apart. When Ben has to face his father, hometown friends and in-laws at his mother's funeral he is cornered with no grace. To make matters worse Julia herself is losing hope in their future and their dreams for a family. Just when Ben feels completely deflated an unexpected measure of acceptance restores his confidence pushing him forward with a surprising outcome.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446361</url></doc>
