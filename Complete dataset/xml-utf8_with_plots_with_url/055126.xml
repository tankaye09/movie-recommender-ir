<plot>An ultimatum has been made. The clock is ticking. Peter must choose between getting a "real job" to keep his girlfriend, or making his dream (being a comic book letterer) come true -- and losing her. Hopefully, with the help of his boss, Al (owner of Al's Comics) and friend Foggy, Peter will find the answer. But nothing's ever that easy. Peter meets the greatest challenge of his life when 2 interlopers threaten everything that is dear to him. All this on the day he's decided to quit smoking. When a beautiful stranger mysteriously appear, Peter's life may be changed forever. But he must decide, and decide fast: Can he leave behind his own BACK ISSUES?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055126</url></doc>
