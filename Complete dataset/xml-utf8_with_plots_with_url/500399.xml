<plot>Bad days were routine for Skippy Lightfoot. He was lonely, unemployed, and convinced his sour luck would never change. Then, a chance meeting with a transient genie offered this terminal pessimist the opportunity to make a wish. Obsessed with his own misfortune, Skippy could only think to ask for the one thing he's never had: a perfect day. A barrage of instant gratification follows as Skippy discovers that, for the next 24 hours, nothing can go wrong. Capitalizing on his assured success, our newly confident hero manipulates this custom-made reality to fulfill his lifelong desires. But, as the approaching stroke of midnight draws closer, so too does a dark stranger with an emphatic warning. And Skippy finds out that perfection may come with a price.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?500399</url></doc>
