<plot>Robert is lying in a room. Blurry, heavy light comes through the windows. Beer bottles are lying on the floor. What time is it? Unimportant. The day of the week? Who cares? One can hear Robert's voice, he's reading a love letter. It's gotta be long time ago, because Robert is alone. Since days, weeks, months. He has stopped to go outside. The world out there doesn't understand him, anyways. Sometimes his girlfriend appears. Out of a sudden she's lying right next to him. Kissing him, making love to him and disappears again. Robert knows, that his girlfriend doesn't exist. Not anymore. Not for him. She's a fiction, but he likes that fiction way more than everything else in this world. That's why he's in that room and not outside. Everyone finds his way through this time of depression. Friends like to laugh about it.They mourned a bit and at some point they got a new love and keep on moving. But not everyone. Some stay where they are. Like Robert. He has stopped the hands of time, just for himself and no matter what, he won't let go. They call it "obsession", but who cares, what they say? He rather waits. The voice in this film talks about things you can't see. Robert sees things, which aren't really happening. Is the ending really, what it seems to be?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?401876</url></doc>
