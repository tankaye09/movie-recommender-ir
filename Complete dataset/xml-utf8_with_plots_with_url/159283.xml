<plot>The documentary focuses on the journey people take to achieve a lifelong dream. Is the risk worth the reward? Six individuals pursue dreams as diverse as forming a rock band to starting a foundation that promotes the conservation of cord blood stem cells. The film is built around the story of the Executive Producer, whose dream is to use the film and accompanying website to connect dreamers from around the world to help them achieve their dreams. How his unorthodox methods contrast with those of the remaining dreamers and which methods lead to fulfillment and success is the them of the film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159283</url></doc>
