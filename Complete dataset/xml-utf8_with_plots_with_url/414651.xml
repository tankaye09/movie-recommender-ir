<plot>"Chechawko" means newcomer. The story goes that in the 1899 days of discoveries a "chechawko" went out on the rich "Bonanza" creek, 14 miles from Dawson, and finding everything staked and claimed, asked the men working there where he could go to locate a good claim. They pointed to this great wash gravel hill, and directed him to the top. He went up and began operations. In three weeks, he had taken out $20,000 by the crudest methods possible, and then accepted $30,000 for his claim. The man that bought it took out $300,000. This view shows tram cars taking the pay dirt out of the hillside to the brow of the hill, where it is shot 500 feet down to Bonanza Creek below, and the gold washed from it. This subject also gives a swinging panorama along the entire hill, and down the great Bonanza Creek.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?414651</url></doc>
