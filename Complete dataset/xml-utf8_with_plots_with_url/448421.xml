<plot>The Netherlands is a civilized country. Differences are settled in a civilized manner. Crime is battled with integrity by an independent, competent police force in an incorruptable justice system. Right? Forget it! Puppet Show introduces the ugly truth: top business people who find extortion acceptable; prejudiced, incompetent police officials who lead investigations they do not understand; a prosecutor who manipulates the US Justice department into kidnapping. lies to to and about Canadian officials, withholds evidence, and falsifies extradition requests; and judges who give it all their blessing. Welcome to justice Netherlands style!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?448421</url></doc>
