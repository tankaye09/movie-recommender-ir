<plot>Rx documents the lives of three patients and three health care providers in South Carolina mirroring a national health care crisis in the U.S.A. This feature documentary examines how uninsured U.S. citizens receive health care and gives a glimpse of the poorest Americans. Rx represents a unique experiment in a College Media Center. Eighteen Undergraduate students at the University of South Carolina traveled to meet the most modest of rural U.S. citizens. Through interviews with a woman who had to pull out her own teeth to an older woman who feels she is no longer an asset to society to a non-English speaking Hispanic woman who is pregnant, the students get a real look at health care in the U.S. This record of health care gives a glimpse into people who have no voice and is intended to open the dialog, especially in an election year, into lives of patients and their medical heroes who continue to provide care despite the odds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?471448</url></doc>
