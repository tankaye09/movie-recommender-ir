<plot>Cowhands Ross Taylor (Tim Holt) and his pal Chito Rafferty (Richard Martin) rescue road-construction engineer Dan Madden (Regis Toomey) and his wife, Mary (Lynne Roberts), when Madden is delayed starting work on a road running parallel to a toll road operated by Anson Thurder (John Dehner) and his armed henchmen. After a running gun battle, Ross and Chito get the Maddens to the construction site, aided by Jay Wingate (Robert Shayne), who is in league with Wingate but poses as an advocate of the new road. When Madden's surveying instruments are destroyed while under Wingate's protection, Ross and Chito uncover the connection between Thurber and Wingate. To get rid of Ross, Wingate insinuates that Ross and Mary are having an affair. Ross kncoks him down but is arrested for assault by the sheriff (Don Haggerty), but Chito rescues him. Ross and Chito save Madden from Wingate's next scheme to get rid of him, but all three are trapped in a canyon wired with dynamite and about to be set off by Wingate's men.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162993</url></doc>
