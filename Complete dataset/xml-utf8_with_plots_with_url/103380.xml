<plot>This MGM Oddity shows a couple driving through Mexico. Their first stop is a small village in which all the residents are Russian. They speak only Russian and follow their native customs as much as they are able. At their campsite, the travelers witness a fight between two turtles. Finally, they stop at a ranch, where they see a fight between a German shepherd and a rattlesnake.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103380</url></doc>
