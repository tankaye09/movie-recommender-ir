<plot>"This is a railroad panorama, taken over a section of track so full of sharp reverse curves that whenever an engineer runs his train over the section, he terms it 'Snapping the Whip.' The ground is covered with snow, the picture having been taken in the early winter, and the scene is very picturesque."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503101</url></doc>
