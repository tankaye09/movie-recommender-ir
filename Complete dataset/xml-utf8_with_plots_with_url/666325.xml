<plot>After reading the description of this film, the bald heads in the front row will subscribe to the title of this film. A fast train is seen approaching in the distance and after rounding a curve, the last car lurches to such an extent that somebody's mother-in-law, who has been looking at the country scenery was thrown off the train. After the train disappears from view, she suddenly arises, and picking up her skirts, runs after the train, motioning for it to return. She continues on her mad dash until she disappears from view. This is a side-splitter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666325</url></doc>
