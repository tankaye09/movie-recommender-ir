<plot>This picture portrays a natural scene. An incline is in full view, looking up. The horses draw the wagons loaded with dirt to the foot of the incline, when a rope is attached which leads to a dummy engine at the top of the hill. At a given signal the engineer starts the engine and the wagon is drawn to the top. The incline is so steep that it would be impossible for four horses to attempt the work. Very good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231605</url></doc>
