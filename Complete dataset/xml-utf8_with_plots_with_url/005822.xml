<plot>4CORNERS - A Southwest Adventure begins at the only point in America where four states meet. The borders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah intersect among the scenic mountains, raging rivers, remote canyons and historic cultures of the American Southwest. Many of the national parks in the region are featured, including Zion, Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, as well as Black Canyon of the Gunnison and Grand Staircase-Escalante parks. Also featured are slot canyons, steam trains, boating and jet-skiing on Lake Powell, mountain biking and other adventure sports, including skiing and kayaking. The motion picture begins at the Four Corners monument, which marks the place where all four states meet. In the mountains of Colorado, the "Million Dollar Highway" looks out over the rugged San Juan Mountain Range, where snowmelt feeds the Animas River far below. There, a historic steam train whistles its way down through the canyon, offering an unforgettable railroading experience. In the canyonlands of Utah, the waters of the Green and Colorado Rivers merge and flow into Lake Powell, a labyrinth of narrow canyons which can be explored by boat or jet-ski. A visit to the lake's famous Rainbow Bridge hints at a sunset visit to the stunning Delicate Arch in Utah's Arches National Park. Not far away, the Shafer Grade and Slickrock bike trails near Moab challenge mountain bikers with their steep descents and breathtaking climbs amid cactus blooms and mountain vistas. Visits to Capitol Reef, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks show the diversity of the landscape to be found here. After winding through a slot canyon in Arizona, shopping for pottery becomes a highlight to visits of Taos and Santa Fe. Finally, a tour of ancient cultural ruins ends with a huge Native American celebration of heritage.</plot><plot>4CORNERS - A Southwest Adventure begins at the only point in America where four states meet.
