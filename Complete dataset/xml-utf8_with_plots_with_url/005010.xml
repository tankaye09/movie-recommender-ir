<plot>When the D.C.P. is told that a vacationing college student has disappeared in Ramgarh Picnic Cottage, he deputes Inspector Vijay to investigate and report back to him in 30 days. Upon arrival in Ramgarh, Vijay is confronted with Police Inspector Mukesh Dubey, who refuses to undertake any investigation into this disappearance as he believes that the death was caused by the vengeful spirit of a girl named Shalu. Police Constables would rather be suspended and lose their jobs, rather than take the risk of getting involved with Shalu's spirit. To make matters worse, more disappearances occur, with the mysterious appearance of an investigator of the occult, Robert. As his tenure of 30 days comes to a close, Inspector Vijay will find that he is nowhere near solving this case - and may well end up as a casualty himself.</plot><plot>When the D.C.P. is told that a vacationing college student has disappeared in Ramgarh Picnic Cottage, he deputes Inspector Vijay to investigate and report back to him in 30 days.
