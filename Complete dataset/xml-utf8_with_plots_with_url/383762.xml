<plot>The Darwish brothers fled Baghdad to Israel in the 1950s and established "Fantasia" - a menorah factory in Tel Aviv's industrial zone. Stirred by the bombing of Baghdad and Tel Aviv in the Gulf War of 1991, director Duki Dror - the son of the youngest of the three brothers - retraces his Iraqi roots. Faced with the reclusive silence of his father, Dror digs up bits of information about the family's past. Finally, his reluctant father divulges a long kept secret. A revelatory family portrait that balances humor with pain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383762</url></doc>
