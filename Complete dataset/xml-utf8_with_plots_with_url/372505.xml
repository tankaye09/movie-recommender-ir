<plot>A nightmare scenario. On the first night of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, US Navy Pilot Michael "Scott" Speicher is shot down over Iraq. And with no sign of life, he is declared dead - the first casualty on the first night of the first Gulf War. Then, ten years later, the unthinkable. In 2001, based on mounting evidence that Speicher had actually survived and was being held as a POW, the Secretary of the Navy changes Speicher's status from Killed in Action to Missing in Action - the first time an American veteran in any war had ever been removed from the KIA list and declared MIA instead. Now, a family and a nation watches and waits. After a second war with Iraq, coalition forces in Baghdad search for answers. But so far, even the fall of Saddam Hussein has yet to solve the mystery and bring Scott Speicher home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372505</url></doc>
