<plot>A group in front of the old log cabin, characteristic of life in the South. An old granny is spinning cotton with a spinning wheel, an old darky is telling stories to the pickaninnies and "Laughing Ben" stands by to do his part. A very interesting subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411248</url></doc>
