<plot>This is a new version of the old subject but is far superior, in that it contains more action and being taken slower remains on the screen longer than an ordinary 100 foot film. A man is seen to enter a room and takes off his hat which he places on a table. Hats in profusion appear on his head, one after the other; no sooner does he remove one than another takes its place on his head. This is repeated when he removes his coat and vest, and in the end he appears to lose his reason. Marvelous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556118</url></doc>
