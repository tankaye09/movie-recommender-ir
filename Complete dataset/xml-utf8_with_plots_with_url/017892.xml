<plot>The New England Variety Club and the Boston Red Sox present this in-theater appeal for contributions to Boston's Jimmy Fund, for child cancer treatment and research. Debbie Reynolds addresses the audience as a mother whose daily prayer is for the health and happiness of her two children. Yet cancer claims the lives of thousands of children annually. Health professionals treat children in 532 beds in Boston while researchers look for a cure -- all funded by contributions to the Jimmy Fund. We see the children and the researchers. "Help speed THE END of cancer in children," reads a closing title card.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017892</url></doc>
