<plot>Focus Room reveals a comical day in the life of an actor who can't act and what he does to make ends meet. With little acting ability and no consistent work, David winds up attending focus groups to earn his rent money. However, he is forced to embellish his qualifications and create alternate identities. This is in order to make it past the recruiters and on into the groups themselves. Inevitably, David trips himself up and barely earns his money. If it weren't for his faithful roommate, all would be lost. All is lost when his love interest hears about his actions. Things quickly change for David romantically but he goes back to his usual ways without a second thought.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198738</url></doc>
