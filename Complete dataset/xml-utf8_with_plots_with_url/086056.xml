<plot>It's construction like you've never seen it before! Building the Biggest is an innovative six-part series capturing the most ambitions building projects shaping our world today. From pipelines and diamond mines to the International Space Station and the Singapore subway system, Building the Biggest examines what it takes to get the job done and meets with the masters of construction who make the seemingly impossible a practical reality. Every episode of Building the Biggest examines a single major construction process - from diamond mining to roller coaster building - following the most dramatic points in construction that demand the steadiest hands, heaviest machines - and coolest nerves. Find out exactly what it takes for a construction dream to be become a steel and concrete reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086056</url></doc>
