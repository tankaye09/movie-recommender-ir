<plot>A man looks back on his life and the choices he made, reliving them through his memories and realizing how he shaped his own future. This story is about life, and how sometimes, even though we don't want to, we fall prey to living a life we did not want. How plans that we thought would bring in hope and happiness, only bring in turn sadness and regret. This is a story about the conformism we sometimes succumb to, and that most times cannot escape. This is a story about clasping a dream so tight, and then letting it go; but the feeling of the dream never leaves. This is a story about life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134520</url></doc>
