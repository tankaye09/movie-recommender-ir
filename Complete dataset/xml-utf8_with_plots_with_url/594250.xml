<plot>Two men who look very much alike approach each other warily, show their empty palms, and then go to podiums separated by a long table. Each speaks in turn in a declamatory style, emphatic, argumentative. The languages spoken are unknown, but the meaning clear: there's a dispute and, at this summit, perhaps a treaty can be reached.
