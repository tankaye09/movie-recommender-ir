<plot>Paul Pearson, a lifelong Santa Monica resident, has been building electric cars for his own use and for friends in Santa Monica. He was recently visited by a DMV sting operation, in which he agreed to help two gentlemen convert a Ford Thunderbird to full electric power. Consequently he has faced several trumped up charges and swatted them all off like flies. The prosecutor (Santa Monica assistant City Attorney Gary Rhoades) continues to try to convict Paul of something (to justify the waste of public funds? - Or, to avoid a Malicious Prosecution suit?), the defense has proven that Paul was not guilty of breaking any laws. After trying and failing to convict Paul of Illegal Manufacturing, re-manufacturing, illegal advertising, etc, the City Attorney is now calling Paul a 'media whore'. The irony is that Paul is actually building electric vehicles for another department of the City of Santa Monica.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220995</url></doc>
