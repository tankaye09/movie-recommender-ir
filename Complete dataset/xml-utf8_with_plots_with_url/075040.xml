<plot>Blood, Sweat and Head Butts is a Danish documentary portraying the struggle of the enthusiastic wrestlers from a small Danish wrestling federation, as they try to make their combined passion, the marginal sport of professional wrestling, popular and well respected in Denmark. The wrestlers have to work together to succeed, but the federation is under threat from internal disagreements, strife and turmoil, as two men battle for the presidency of the federation. It's so important to them that they're prepared to put everything on the line. Their savings, their health, their friendship. Meanwhile, a controversial upcoming wrestler from the Danish capital is determined to show the established hillbilly wrestlers that he has the superstar potential that will lift Danish wrestling to new heights.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075040</url></doc>
