<plot>In late 1911, G. Georgescu hired two writers who had a scenario (E. Girleanu and V. Eftimiu) to produce a film. The actors (M. Voiculescu and T. Bulandra) played only on probation, for a couple of takes, because Georgescu was in a lack of money. The production was abandoned... Three years later, in September 1914 this movie was released in Bucharest (at Cinema "Venus"). It was made only from letters, titles and the few film shots from 1911. This was not agreed by the public, so the movie run for just 8 days.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159035</url></doc>
