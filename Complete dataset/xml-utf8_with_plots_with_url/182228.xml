<plot>Set in the idyllic English countryside, Constance, a dancer, and Killian, her choreographer husband, have just bought a new home after the birth of their first child. Suffering from post-natal depression, Constance cannot return to ballet and Killian is increasingly absent on tour. Alone with their daughter Evie, Constance descends into isolation and despair. As Evie gets older their relationship deteriorates until one night she disappears into the woods. Haunted by vivid dreams of the fantastical world her daughter now inhabits, Constance is comforted by the knowledge of Evie's happiness. Evie's new home is a timeless world of eternal childhood. With three other little girls she lives in a place where disappointment and corruption cannot harm her. But fairy tales, like childhood, cannot last for ever. As reality and fantasy begin to bleed into one another, Constance's life begins to fragment. Slowly but surely the fantastical idyll unravels leaving nothing but the abrasive truth of reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?182228</url></doc>
