<plot>Wealthy businessman, Srivastav, lives in a palatial house with his wife, Yashoda, and an only child, a son named Shyam, who likes to paint. Shyam is expected to marry Renu, the daughter of a business-friend, Kailashnath. Unknown to both the families, Shyam and Renu have already met, and fallen in love. When things start going wrong with the Srivastav's business dealings, they stand to lose everything, until and unless Shyam marries the only daughter, Menaka Rai, of the most wealthiest man in Bombay. Yashoda and her husband readily agree to this marriage, but Shyam refuses, as a result is asked to leave the house, and his parents will have nothing to do with him. Shyam and Renu begin their life together, but the unexpected happens, and a woman who is in love with Shyam, Meera, is killed and the police arrest Shyam for her death. He is produced in Court and is sentenced to die. But then the unexpected happens again, as Meera is still alive, and as a result Shyam is freed from prison. He goes to meet Renu and renew their love and get married, only to find out that Renu has got married to a Dr. Prakash, and will have nothing to do with him. A devastated Shyam must now decide to carry on with life and marry Meera, or go on a path of self-destruction.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420560</url></doc>
