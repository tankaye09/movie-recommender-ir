<plot>Philip Jenkins is unwanted. He walks head down, sad, in suit, hat, and wire-rim glasses. In this nearly wordless animation, bad things happen to him. First an elevator malfunction leads to a trip to the hospital: he leaves with his arm in a sling. Another accident at work results in another hospital visit. The same indifferent stretcher bearers and the same indifferent nurse see to his care. Now, his leg is in a cast as well as his arm. He soldiers on, using a cane. When a traffic sign malfunctions, it's back to the hospital; he leaves with bandaged head, piloting a wheelchair. But his woes aren't over yet. After one more mishap, Philip Jenkins finally has something to say.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041975</url></doc>
