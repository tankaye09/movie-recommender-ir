<plot>In 2009, it is safe to say most people plan their days around the services of digital media. We have live news, on-demand movies, and mp3 downloads available to us instantly. But only several generations ago, none of these services existed, in a time when we could not tune out to other things. Instead, Americans shared a collective experience, listening to the programs of radio. Over the course of one semester, a sound design class at Georgia Southern University is charged to re-create a radio drama from the early twentieth century. While they have all the training and modern resources, their only personal connection to the era is through textbooks. Featuring famed performers from the Golden Age of Radio, discover the challenges of creating compelling content through the lens of those at the beginning and end of their careers, in a place as big as your imagination.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603141</url></doc>
