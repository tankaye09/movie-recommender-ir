<plot>Stefan Baxter takes photos. His wife, Helga, wants to sell them. His photos are quite popular, due to the inclusion of a big bright yellow duck that Stefan unconciously includes in every single photo. Once this is brought to his attention, he brings his "muse" to the foreground rather than the background, and his photos no longer sell, but he's a happier person for it, and his relationship with the duck grows.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431492</url></doc>
