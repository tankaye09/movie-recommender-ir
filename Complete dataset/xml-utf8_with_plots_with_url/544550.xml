<plot>A voice-over intones, 'In July, 1998, three models went fishing at Fish Lake. They took three bottles of tequila, margarita mix, some ice, their fishing gear, and a video camera. They were never seen again. [pause] One year later their videotape, along with their fashionable swimwear, was found.' A spoof on 'Blair Witch Project' has a nervous model behind the camera, adding her fears and apologies from time to time, and two other models who bicker continuously. Things go from bad to worse: lost map, no mascara, life-sized inflatable dolls hanging from trees by their campsite. Is murder afoot?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544550</url></doc>
