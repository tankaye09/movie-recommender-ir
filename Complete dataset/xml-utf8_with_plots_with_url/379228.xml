<plot>A pair of furniture movers take a call to move the contents of a house where a tragedy has occurred. When they arrive, the movers Karl and Scott, meet their contact from an insurance/trust company, David; a young business co-op student who shows them around the suburban, middle class home where a man has killed his family and himself. Karl, Scott and David spend the day together, packing furniture, discussing the best way to go about the cataloging of the contents, eating, telling stories and interacting; constantly reminded of the gravity of an event whose aftermath they have all somehow come to have a minor role in.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379228</url></doc>
