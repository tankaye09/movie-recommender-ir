<plot>On December 30, 2004 in Buenos Aires, a kid at a night-club called The Republic of Cromagnon lit a flare, which caused a fire that killed nearly 200 people. The terrible tragedy has tremendous social and political causes and consequences that will forever change Argentina. In the short documentary 'The Massacre in the Republic of Cromagnon,' an American student studying abroad in Argentina captures the aftermath of the tragedy and investigates what went on December 30, and what is going on today. Through interviews with survivors, lawyers, and family of victims, the documentary sheds light on the tragedy by retelling the events and exploring the theme of 'justice' in a corrupt government.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575564</url></doc>
