<plot>The creator of Spawn, Todd McFarlane, talks about how the film Spawn (1997) compares to his comic book creation. Though this is more of a collection of rants that took place over the course of a fairly large interview session, it is still pretty interesting to hear what this guy has to say. He even attacks how Hollywood would have handled the situation had Spawn (1997) had been extremely popular.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?610921</url></doc>
