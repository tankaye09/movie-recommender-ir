<plot>Filmmaker Megan Fincher lived and worked in homeless supportive services in downtown Los Angeles for two years. When people found out she was a poet, they felt compelled to share their work with her. In the spring of 2009, Megan traveled back to Los Angeles to document the poetry of her friends, the homeless and formerly homeless residents of the area known as 'Skid Row.' Skid Row, a 0.85 square mile section of downtown, provides a home to over 5,000 homeless residents on any given night. This film features six individuals: their faces, their stories, and most importantly, their poetry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583150</url></doc>
