<plot>Successful golf-course architect Ercole gives up his job one day and takes over as the head of the orphanage in which he spent the first twelve years of his life. There he meets his erstwhile best friend Vito again, who has never come to terms with the fact that Ercole was adopted while he wasn't. Slowly, however, their former friendship returns, and together the two of them manage to improve conditions at the orphanage and give the neglected children renewed hope for the future by doing all they can to find suitable adoptive families or temporary foster families for them. When Ercole and Vito fall in love with the same woman, their friendship is put to the test yet again. The young, self-confident trainee Anna falls in love with Vito, however, and is soon expecting his baby. Nevertheless it takes quite some time before Vito is genuinely convinced of her feelings for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?631408</url></doc>
