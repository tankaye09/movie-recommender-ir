<plot>Deep within the woods on the outskirts of Tallahassee, Florida lies Six-Mile Pond, where a different kind of sport is played. For generations now the unofficial sport of Mudbogging has been a unique pastime of some outdoor-loving southerners. Though this often dangerous and environmentally unfriendly sport has yet to be officially outlawed, mudbogging areas have become increasingly sparse - much to the dismay of passionate "mudders." On Six-Mile Pond follows the dedicated few who see "muddin'" as not just a sport, but a way of life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410702</url></doc>
