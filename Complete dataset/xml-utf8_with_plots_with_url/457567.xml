<plot>We all want to receive love, and yet the simple truth is that we do a lot of work to restrict the amount of love we let in. In this home study video, you will have the opportunity to explore how, in an effort to protect yourself from feeling pain, you learned to restrict your willingness to receive love. You will have the opportunity to dissolve old rules that hold you back from receiving love and expand your experience of love on a day-to-day basis. Integrated AwarenessÂ® is one of the most powerful and least known healing modalities in the world. Join Mark Fourman, Certified Integrated Awareness Teacher, as he gently guides you through the explorations on this video to begin opening up to all the love that is available to you.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457567</url></doc>
