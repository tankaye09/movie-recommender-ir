<plot>Resu and Arturo are going to be parents. Resu is 49 years old and she is expecting twins. She married past her forties and the only option left for her to have children was assisted reproduction. Victoria is 54 years old and is the mother of 2 years old twins. She had difficulties in finding a medical clinic that would accept to submit her to fertility treatment; her case sets out not only medical problems, but also ethical problems. Experts fear that late maternity may cause psychological problems in the children, who when they reach puberty will find themselves with parents old enough to be their grandparents. But this is not the only dilemma that society faces. Assisted reproduction techniques make possible new kinds of motherhood, like lesbian mothers or single women. Scientifically that is possible, but socially it is still hard to accept. That is the case of Silvia, who decided to have a child by herself with the help of in vitro fertilization. She is happy, but in the nursery and in her neighborhood the question is always the same: who is the father?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351348</url></doc>
