<plot>When emerging filmmaker Nooshin J. Navidi landed in Iran, she expected to find a highly politicized, zealous young population. Instead, she discovered university students like Davood and Nooshin A., who like many students in Iran and America, were striving for success. But as Nooshin stepped through doors and classrooms never entered into by a Westerner, she found more to post-revolution Iran than meets the eye. A new generation stuck between a desire to hold onto their Persian identity and modernize with the latest technologies, and of course, dating. Reflective and lyrical, Young Republic engages in dialogue with students and young people. Playful conversations turn to heated debates, and humorous stories lend insight into the how the 'young republic' hopes to shape the future of Iran.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667235</url></doc>
