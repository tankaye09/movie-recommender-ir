<plot>The emperor has surrounded himself with a treacherous relative named Thakur Veer Pratap Singh, who has openly declared that he will succeed the Emperor by hook or by crook, and the only one standing in his way is the crown prince, a mere child. The emperor entrusts the life of his son with his trusted Diwan Sardarilal, and the Diwan and his family consisting of his wife, a son and a daughter escape. Unfortunately, the Diwan is caught by the Thakur and imprisoned. His wife escapes with her children, but the crown prince is separated. It is only the Diwan who knows who the real crown prince is, as he had placed a locket around his neck. This locket has half of a secret map that will lead to a hidden treasure, and no one knows the whereabouts of the other locket, which contains the second half of the treasure map.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340210</url></doc>
