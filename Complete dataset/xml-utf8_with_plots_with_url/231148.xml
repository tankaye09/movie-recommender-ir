<plot>"A remarkably interesting view taken from the front end of a locomotive on one of the most picturesque bits of track along the Hudson. The train passes through the tunnel, and the view of the gradually increasing opening, as the train emerges from the opposite side, is particularly novel. The most delightful bit on the West Shore Railroad. First view of the Hudson on the northbound trip."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231148</url></doc>
