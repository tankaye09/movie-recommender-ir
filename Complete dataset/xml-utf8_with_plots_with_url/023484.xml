<plot>Mr. Verma is the proud owner of a spacious bunglow named "Dharam Niwas". He is critical of his second son, Jaggan Verma (Kiran Kumar) due to his drinking habits, people of lose or no morals, and asks him to leave the house. Jaggan leaves the house, but swears that he will avenge this humiliation. Years later, Mr. Verma has passed away, and Jaggan has two sons, Raghunath (Paresh Rawal), and Rocky (Gulshan Grover); while Mr. Verma's elder son, Bharat (Rakesh Pandey) has two sons, Avinash (Shatrughan Sinha), an Assistant Commissioner of Police, and Vicky (Sanjay Dutt). This is when Jaggan's plan comes into being, and he has Avinash framed and sent to prison for 14 years. After 14 years have passed, Avinash returns home to find that his brother is now working with Raghunath, who next plan is to kill Avinash at the hands of none other than Vicky.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023484</url></doc>
