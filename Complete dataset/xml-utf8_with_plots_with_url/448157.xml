<plot>Popeye drops a TV off at the orphanage; the program that comes on is a boxing match he's supposed to be in, so he dashes off. The fight is against the champ, who is huge. Popeye gets pummelled in the first round, but his fighting spirit materializes and advises him to outwit his opponent. In the second round, he does so. The champ then uses a light socket to "burn out" Popeye so he can't outthink him, and (as with the rest of this pun-filled match) "knocks him cold", turning him into a block of ice. The orphans feed Popeye his spinach right through the TV set, and he comes back to knock the champ through the screen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?448157</url></doc>
