<plot>Sucker tells the story of a young man and his notable "talent". Throughout this short film he proves his skills. Sometimes it's a quickie, other times with a group scene or by using handcuffs; even overnight sessions with his online buddies. Finally however he shows his expertise with both intensity and intimacy as he attempts to land the lust (and love?) of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520110</url></doc>
