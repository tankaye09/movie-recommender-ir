<plot>At first, four swordsmen hired to bring back a runaway concubine appear to be competent mercenaries, but soon prove themselves to be a bunch of incompetent buffoons. Their leader, Yae-rang, only has one fighting stance: to drop his sword, make faces at the enemy and pinch his own nipples. Yo-i, is just as idiotic, but at least has a touch of humanity as he works as a mercenary only to earn money for his kid sister. The four take the concubine and her lover into custody, but also accidentally manage to somehow ruin the chance for the ghosts of five murdered courtesans to ascend to heaven. The warriors agree to kill the man responsible which will set the ghosts free, but they must be taught a few tricks by the ghosts as their existing martial arts skills are nearly useless.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?389409</url></doc>
