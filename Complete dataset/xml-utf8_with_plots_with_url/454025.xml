<plot>On April 17, 1975, the face of Cambodia would forever be changed. As Khmer Rouge soldiers marched into the capital city of Phnom Penh, the unsuspecting people of Cambodia had little idea they would be forced into a living nightmare for nearly four years. Rain Falls From Earth is a story of courage, a story of survival, and a story of eventual triumph over the Communist regime that was responsible for the deaths of over 2 million people. The voices of many Cambodians are heard as they convey their thoughts, ideas and emotions - the very things they were forced to abandon in the "killing fields" of Cambodia. Their stories are an eyewitness account to genocide. This film gives a voice to those whose lives were senselessly lost. It is a story that must be told. It is a story that will be told.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454025</url></doc>
