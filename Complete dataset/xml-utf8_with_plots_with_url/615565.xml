<plot>The correct title of this film (on the film, the posters, the lobby cards and the press book) is "Trails of Danger" while "Trails of Peril" was a working title that appeared in a trade publication that was printed before the film was released as "Trails of Danger. " Consequently, some sources think, because "Trails of Peril" appears in a print source as the title, that "Trails of Peril" is the actual title because that title also appears in an often-unreliable catalog, put together by file clerks who copied it from the original trade source. It isn't. Whatever. Anyway, Bob Bartlett (Wally Wales) returns from WWI with little but medals, but is anxious to do something significant before facing his father, U. S. Marshal Bartlett (Joe Rickson. ) Bob saves Mary Martin (Virginia Brown Faire) and her father John Martin (Buck Connors) from an attack by two outlaws, and he later finds a beautiful horse (Starlight, the Wonder Horse) that belongs to a bandit, although he (Bob, not the horse) doesn't know it. The horse doesn't seem to know it either. First rattle out of the box, Bob, now riding Starlight,gets into trouble the next day when the stagecoach arrives, as the horse is identified as the one rode by the leader, Butch Coleman (Frank Ellis), of the bandits who held up the stage. Bob makes his escape, evades the posse led by Sheriff Johnson (Jack Perrin) and sets out to capture Coleman and his gang and win the heart of Mary. He does so, and as he claims the reward and Mary, he is discovered as the son of the Marshal paying the reward.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615565</url></doc>
