<plot>The film depicts the life and career of João Belchior Marques Goulart, known as "Jango", a leader of the Labor Party which eventually (and accidentally) became President of Brazil. Distrusted by the conservative wings and underestimated by the left, Jango defied both sides by presenting a plan for structural reforms in the nation's major problems. His intentions, however, were halted by a military coup, which found no resistance at all, and threw Brazilians into a 20 years dictatorship. This documentary tries to debate how naïf President Jango was and how the right-wing managed to win so easily.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273809</url></doc>
