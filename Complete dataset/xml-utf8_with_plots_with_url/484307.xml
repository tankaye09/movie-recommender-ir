<plot>A Chinese mother and father come to LA from Hong Kong to attend their youngest daughter's graduation. It's a family reunion of sorts, as the eldest daughter, who runs a travel agency in New York, attends as well. The youngest wants to take her parents to see the sights, so they take a trip to the Grand Canyon. Along the way, the car breaks down. The youngest daughter calls her boyfriend, a Chinese-Indonesian, who appears on the scene in the desert driving a 1953 baby blue Cadillac hearse - complete with coffin stocked with cold drinks and ice cream. This creates more conflict between the daughter and her controlling, highly critical mother. Along the way, more about the parents and their relationships are revealed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484307</url></doc>
