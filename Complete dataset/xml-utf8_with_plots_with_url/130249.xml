<plot>David Blaine does it again. With 'Vertigo', we see some more incredible magic and unusual illusions. Intercut with the Magic is David - standing on a pole in NY for two days. A pole that seemed to be extended 10 stories tall with nothing for him to hang on to - and there was nothing to catch him. This portion of the program was live and at the end of the show - he jumped into a stack of cardboard boxes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130249</url></doc>
