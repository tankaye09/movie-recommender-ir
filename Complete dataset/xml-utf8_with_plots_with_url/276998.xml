<plot>This picture was taken at a temperature of fifty degrees below zero. Jim has returned from a stampede and his wife will not let him in. He is sitting down in the snow, telling his troubles to his bull dog, Romeo. As he cries and tells his troubles, you can distinctly see his breath as it freezes. Very comical. Sleighs and people are seen passing in the background.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276998</url></doc>
