<plot>Tommy is an unhappy seven year old boy who is still grieving for the death of his father, whilst battling with his new stepfather. When a moth dies in the palm of his hand he is fascinated by the residue it leaves behind - "magic dust, that helps the moths to fly" his mother tells him. Tommy becomes obsessed with moths, seeing them as the only way to escape from the conflict around and within him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378165</url></doc>
