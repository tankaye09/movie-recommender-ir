<plot>In this show, three couples competed in a huge Supermarket to buy for free all that they could put into their trolleys. The lucky couple that at the end had earned most, went on to a final test which worked like the typical Scavenger Hunt with some changes. Starting with a clue given by the host, they had to find out the product the clue was referring to, go and get it. That product had attached a card with another clue to find another product, and so on. In the fifth product there was the final card they had to give to the host with the five products in the trolley. If they did it on time, they earned money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522673</url></doc>
