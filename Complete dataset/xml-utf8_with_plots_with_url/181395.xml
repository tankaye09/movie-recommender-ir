<plot>The newly-discovered cat-people of Planet Cassius are the cute darlings of the galactic media. It is Galactic Law that emerging species must be introduced to high-tech slowly and carefully so as not to shock their culture. The Cassians have other ideas and smugglers like Liz are doing good business. The Cassians' dirty secret is that another intelligent species, the Gossans, also live on Cassius and the Cassians are hell-bent on using their new-found advantage to wipe out the Gossans. Liz's conscience gets the better of her when she meets 2 Gossan refugees, but to blow the whistle on the Cassians they need to fight their way out past the planetary internet barrier.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?181395</url></doc>
