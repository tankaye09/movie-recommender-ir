<plot>When Claudia (Nora Aunor), a former Filipina professor now working as a caregiver in America, moves her mother Corazon (Gloria Sevilla) to the care home where she works, the latter feels hurt and humiliated. Like many Filipinos, Corazon believes that being put in a care home means being rejected by her daughter who, she feels, favors her American husband over her. Although she establishes friendships and bonds with the people in the care home, Corazon refuses to forgive and talk with her daughter. The crisis in the relationship between mother and daughter comes to a halt when Claudia's secret is revealed and Corazon is faced with a critical decision for her future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?094238</url></doc>
