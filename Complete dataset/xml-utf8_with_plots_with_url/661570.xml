<plot>In this educational series, we see the misadventures of Henry, a young reporter working in a small newspaper under a tyrannical editor and with a friendly secretary. For a professional journalist, his writing skills need a lot of coaching as his editor is quick to point out and is ready with lessons to help him improve. Fortunately, that office tends to get into the strangest situations that always helps him review his lessons, and more often he has daydreams where he is a dashing hero who has adventures that review his lessons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661570</url></doc>
