<plot>Three long time friends find themselves in a familiar sisterhood with women from Any Urban City, USA. Through a series of failed relationships, bad dates, and miss-matches, they are all single, successful, and beautiful looking for love. Their pure and honest friendships are the ties that bind them together. We follow their individual plights as they seek to resolve their dilemmas with their sexuality, love, careers, and family. Pudding is often brutally honest, yet irresistibly funny. The audience is captivated by their honesty, vulnerability, and candor. Our leads eventually are forced to search within in order to come to terms with their inner most desires and shortcomings. Underneath all the layers of their delicate psyche, their collaborative conclusion is that happiness is all they are in search of and can be found within themselves- a place where it's always been. But the romantic love they so desperately seek, is just the PUDDING on top.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?447625</url></doc>
