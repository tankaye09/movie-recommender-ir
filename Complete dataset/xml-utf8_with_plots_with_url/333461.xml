<plot>Let's Get Real gives young people the chance to tell their stories in their own words and the results are heartbreaking, shocking, inspiring and poignant. Let's Get Real examines a variety of issues that lead to taunting and bullying, including racial differences, perceived sexual orientation, learning disabilities, religious differences, sexual harassment and others. The film not only gives a voice to targeted kids, but also to kids who do the bullying to find out why they lash out at their peers and how it makes them feel. The most heartening part of Let's Get Real includes stories of kids who have mustered the courage to stand up for themselves or a classmate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333461</url></doc>
