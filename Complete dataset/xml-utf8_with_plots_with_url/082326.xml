<plot>This inspiring documentary tells the story of Jail Guitar Doors, Billy Bragg's independent initiative which aims to provide instruments to those who are using music as a means of achieving the rehabilitation of prison inmates. It features performances by 'graduates' from Jail Guitar Doors as well as from many of the artists that have supported the program including Mick Jones (The Clash) Chris Shiflett (Foo Fighters) Sam Duckworth (Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly) and Billy Bragg himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082326</url></doc>
