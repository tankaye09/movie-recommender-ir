<plot>A woman ties her husband up while he is sleeping, shoots a bullet into his leg and starts a humiliating questioning at gunpoint. The negative energy stored up for years now sweeps them both out in a storm of ferocious rivalry. Clutched at each other they are desperately looking for a way out of their utter dead end confusion. Without even knowing their names, we learn a universe about human relations. Eventually they look at each other for the first time as two human beings, unable to lie or hide anything; the solutions are unexpected for both of them. They discover the controversy of the truth that it is impossible neither to stay together, nor to part.</plot><plot>A woman ties her husband up while he is sleeping, shoots a bullet into his leg and starts a humiliating questioning at gunpoint.
