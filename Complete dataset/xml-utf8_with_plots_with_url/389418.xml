<plot>Nanhe Jaisalmer is a little boy who lives in Jaisalmer and makes a living by giving camel rides to tourists. Besides camel Raja, his family comprises his mother and sister. A childhood encounter with actor Bobby Deol has left an indelible mark on the mind of Nanhe who idolizes the actor. Years later, Bobby Deol visits Jaisalmer again for a shooting stint, and he meets little Nanhe every evening. Nanhe hides this fact from his mother because she is tired of his madness for the actor. Anyway, during Bobby Deol's stay in Jaisalmer, Nanhe is forced to attend evening classes so that he can grow up to be an educated man. He resents this but Bobby Deol convinces him to study. Bobby Deol gives Nanhe his word to attend his sister's wedding but arrives late, after the wedding is over and all the guests have gone home. It is then Nanhe's mother points out to him that Bobby Deol had never come again to Jaisalmer after his first encounter with Nanhe as a kid, and that Nanhe had had imaginary meetings with the actor. Anyway, notwithstanding the imaginary encounters, Bobby had changed Nanhe's life. He grows up to become a well-read author.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?389418</url></doc>
