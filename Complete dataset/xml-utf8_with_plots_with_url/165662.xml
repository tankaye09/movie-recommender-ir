<plot>Dave has asked Anna, a good friend, to meet him by a fountain in a plaza. He's rehearsed what he wants to say, but when she responds differently than he'd imagined, he pulls out a Magic Wand cursor, and edits their reality as if it were a computer screen. He works his way through his plan to tell her he'd like to be more than friends, but along the way, there are some glitches. Is the Magic Wand program up to the task? Who will edit the editor?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165662</url></doc>
