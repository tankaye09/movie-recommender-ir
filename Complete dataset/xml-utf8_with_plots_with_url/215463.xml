<plot>Sulukule the gypsy district. Three couples get married in Sulukule - Gullu with Bayram, Sevim with Bekir and Emin with Sabahat. They are homeless and need to earn money somehow. Women sell their last pieces of gold, men get some debts to open their night club. Zekiye's ex-lover Haydar joins them as well. Gullu starts singing at a club where she meets Dursun. Dursun fancies her but Gullu does not respond to his affections. So the angry Dursun puts heroin in her pocket and gets her arrested. However, his plan backfires as the police catches him instead. Fun and laughter is back to Sulukule.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215463</url></doc>
