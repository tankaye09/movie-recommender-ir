<plot>A wooden building in course of construction, forms the background. A carpenter is nailing on the rough wall boards. A laborer comes with a wheelbarrow loaded with bricks. A brick mason then appears at the window with a tub, and holding it on the window sill, the bricks begin to fly from the ground into the tub. He repeatedly dumps the bricks on the floor inside the building and comes back to the window for another load, until the bricks all disappear from the ground. The carpenter then turns around on the ladder, and beckoning to some boards on the ground, they fly to his arms and then to their places on their building, where they are properly adjusted and nailed. The carpenter then jumps from the ladder to the ground, and picking up an armful of boards, jumps backwards to the top of the ladder. The laborer again appears and beckoning to the wheelbarrow, it turns over and jumps after him, and is closely followed by the bricks, which fly into the wheelbarrow. A very amusing picture, which will cause laughter in any audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086017</url></doc>
