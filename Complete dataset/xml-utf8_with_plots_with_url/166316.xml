<plot>Tourist season is over and Ranger Willoughby closes the park for the winter, telling the bears they will have to forage for themselves from now on. Fatso Bear is not up to this. Fortunately, he doesn't have to since there is a henhouse nearby with plenty of fresh eggs. Unfortunately, said henhouse is guarded by a tough rooster. He is able to elude the rooster by finally disguising himself as a female chicken which the rooster falls head over heels in love with. Just when Fatso is about to escape with the eggs, the ranger stops him, the eggs hatch, and Fatso, now a mother, must take care of his new "offspring".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166316</url></doc>
