<plot>In 1991, an unsolicited audition tape was sent to a casting director in Hollywood by a 17 year old boy named Bryon L. Elkins from Byesville, Ohio. It was Bryon's dream to be on NBC's hit television series, "Saved By The Bell." For the next ten years, Bryon's tape was circulated through-out the entertainment industry as a joke. In the year 2000, Josh and Steve (two failing, Hollywood wanna-be's) saw Bryon's tape and related to his disposition. Fed up with the constant rejection and disillusionment of Tinsletown, Josh and Steve left L.A. for Ohio to make a documentary about Bryon's life. Upon arriving in Byesville, their experience ballooned into something much deeper than they had expected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195010</url></doc>
