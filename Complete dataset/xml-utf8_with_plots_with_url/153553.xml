<plot>A tribute to Canadian doctor Norman Bethune, whose selfless work gave great assistance to the Chinese army during the Second World War. Made shortly after his death from blood poisoning contracted while trying to save the sick and injured in Mao Zedong's army, this film looks at his many accomplishments in humanitarianism, particularly his driving desire to bring proper medical care to everyone who needed it, regardless of wealth or status.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153553</url></doc>
