<plot>Bomba: Dancing The Drum is a one hour film about the legendary Cepeda family, known as the patriarch family of bomba, Puerto Rico's richest musical expression of its African heritage. For nearly a century, the Cepeda family has been in the forefront of the struggle to keep the bomba tradition alive in Puerto Rico. Don Rafael Cepeda, the 86 year old patriarch of the family, and his wife, Caridad, have passed the tradition on to their 12 children, who, in turn, are passing it on to their children and grandchildren. Saturated with the color, music, and dance of Puerto Rico, Bomba Dancing The Drum is a portrait of a remarkable family that has chosen to embrace the future with the strength of the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078363</url></doc>
