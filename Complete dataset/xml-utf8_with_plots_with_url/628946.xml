<plot>A remarkably clever out-door picture in two scenes. The first shows an old gentleman entering a store and purchasing a large stock of fireworks for the children. He smokes his long pipe as he starts off home. The second scene shows him approaching the house, still puffing away on his big pipe. Just as he arrives home, a spark from the pipe sets the fireworks off, and there is a tremendous explosion. Neighbors rush in from every direction, a policeman calls an ambulance, which comes upon a run, and the poor old gentleman is carried off to the hospital. The realism of this picture is splendid.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?628946</url></doc>
