<plot>Copper River, Alaska, the wildest and swiftest stream in that part of the country, must be swum by the horses and crossed in boats by the men. Our view shows 14 of the poor beasts swimming the rapid current with just their noses and ears protruding, finally emerging from the water and scrambling up the bank. The Siwash Ferry in charge of Dr. Billam, an eccentric Siwash Indian, is seen pulling against the strong current. It lands in front of the camera, the men and Indians jump for the shore, and file in close review past the instrument.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245934</url></doc>
