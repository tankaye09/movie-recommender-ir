<plot>For the past three and a half years, Kevin Spenst has written a short story every day. On the day of his 1000th story he set off on his bike to do a 50 stop reading tour of the city ...in one day. From upscale shoe stores to surprised street corners, "One Thousand Stories" follows Kevin's adventures in guerrilla performance art as he tells his stories to audiences both appreciative and incensed. Filmed without construct from the back of a tandem bicycle, this short documentary chronicles a writer's struggle for success and consequence played out all over the city of Vancouver.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412706</url></doc>
