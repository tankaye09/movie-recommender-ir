<plot>Probably one of the most significant pictures obtained during the tour of Prince Henry of Prussia. The entire complement of cadets at West Point Academy are drawn up in line, and standing in parade rest. Prince Henry and his suite leave the platform on which they are standing for the review and walk out to the line of cadets. After making a close examination, they return to the platform, and as they walk across the field, our camera commands a splendid view of them. They pass close to the lens and a life size picture is obtained of the Prince and his suite, accompanied by the Assistant Secretary of State, Davd J. Hill, Colonel Bingham and General Corbin. They are also accompanied by Superintendent Mills of the West Point Academy. After taking their places upon the reviewing stand, the cadets march in review. During the entire review, Prince Henry and his suite stand watching the parade, and Prince Henry is seen to salute as each platoon passes the reviewing platform. A most excellent and historical picture. Also sold in 100 foot strip.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?443846</url></doc>
