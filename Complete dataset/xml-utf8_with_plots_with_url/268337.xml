<plot>To many in the west, the Iranian struggle during the Iran Iraq war was irrational and tragic, even perverse.

They justify martyrdom and the sacrifice of youth in the name of God and politics as being part of the unavoidable defense of their religion and spiritual dignity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268337</url></doc>
