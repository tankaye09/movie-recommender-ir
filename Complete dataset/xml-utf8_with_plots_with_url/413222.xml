<plot>The race is on for the state railroad franchise. It's the Sudden Pacific (Bluto) against the Onion Pacific (Popeye). Oh, and there's also a kiss from Olive for the winner. Bluto slows down Popeye's start by tossing a load of coal into his smokestack. Bluto then discovers that Olive has been thrown into his train by the force of the starting gun, so he makes her shovel his coal; she jumps to Popeye's train at the first chance. Bluto punches a hole in Popeye's boiler. Panic sets in when the parallel tracks merge crossing a bridge. The trains ride on one rail each with their captains holding on to each other to support them! Bluto grabs Popeye's driveshaft, so Popeye substitutes himself. But then Bluto throws a switch, sending Popeye's train into a crash. Time for spinach, and a quick rebuild.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413222</url></doc>
