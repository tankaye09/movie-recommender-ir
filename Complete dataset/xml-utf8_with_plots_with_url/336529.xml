<plot>Twelve-year old Maggie likes to build miniature houses out of trash. It's easy for her to find trash because she lives on the streets, alone. Middle-aged Margaret tries to deaden the pain in the big house where she lives, alone. There is a door that waits to be opened. No matter where you are, there is always a door. It's not an escape; it's an invitation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336529</url></doc>
