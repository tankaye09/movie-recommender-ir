<plot>What would you do if you knew tÂ­he next fifteen minutes didn't count? Jeremy Saunders has a few ideas. Shadowed by a pair of bizarre strangers, he embarks on a dangerous journey of sordid self-exploration - seemingly without consequences. Saunders believes he can get away with anything during occasional 15-minute periods of time that he is convinced aren't real; but his marriage, work, friendships, and sanity all spiral out of control as he sinks ever deeper into the snare of his own misdeeds. Ultimately, Saunders finds himself questioning everything - including who he has become - as he is forced to face the Truth with one final, life-or-death decision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184201</url></doc>
