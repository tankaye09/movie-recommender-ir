<plot>This is the South Indian version of Superman. The hero, Babu, witnesses the murder of his parents by- get this- Cowboys. He vows revenge, and spends the rest of the 2 hours and 15 minutes of the flick getting his revenge. Throw in some dance numbers, bad hairdos, outrageous acting, and you have yourself a classic of Indian Cinema few have ever seen. The actor, who plays Superman, Rama Rao Taraka Nandamuri, looks like a fat Elvis impersonator, complete with a Giant H on his chest (it stands for Hanuman the monkey god). In his over 50-year career in cinema, he made over 300 movies, and was a founder of his own political party!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522630</url></doc>
