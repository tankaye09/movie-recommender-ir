<plot>An entertaining and educational conversation starter for parents and trusted adults to talk with kids about the dangers of online criminals and predators. Login, (pronounced Logan), is a safety officer on the inside of the computer who takes viewers into the Internet realm to talk about safe Internet use. The program features a visually rich environment with a narrative introduction by Don La Fontaine "the voice of the movies" and a parental segment by the Los Angeles Police Department's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Broken into 3 "Sectors", Sector 1 speaks directly to teens and preteens, Sector 2 is for parents and trusted adults, and Sector 3 is for Families and Friends to watch together. The program also includes an "additional information" section on resources and chatroom lingo. An important and timely program for everyone who is concerned about this subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267021</url></doc>
