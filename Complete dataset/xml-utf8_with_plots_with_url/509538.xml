<plot>"Speaking with Music" is a one-hour documentary about a passionate group of young pianists, and how they express themselves, emotionally and intellectually through their art. These twenty-two artists, aged 14-18, came together at the Inaugural New York Piano Competition, a week of performances, master classes, and ensemble work which was held in the city last Summer. With the competition as a dramatic backdrop, the contestants and their families invite the audience into the world of teenage classical artists. "Speaking with Music" also creates an evocative portrait of Melvin Stecher and Norman Horowitz, the duo pianist team who created the competition, contrasting what it was like for them as young performers in the 1950s with the challenges young pianists face today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509538</url></doc>
