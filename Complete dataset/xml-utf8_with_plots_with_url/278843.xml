<plot>This comedy drama focuses on the trials and tribulations that a family goes through, always reconnecting over Sunday dinner. As a mother and father observe the sometimes difficult events of their grown children's lives, they have to pick when and where to become involved. From Alex, who opened a failed restaurant with her husband Sam, to Robert Jr. who's just welcomed a new baby into the world, the dinner table sees its share of laughter and tears, but over time each family member learns that they depend on each other to get through it - even when they're at each other's throats.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278843</url></doc>
