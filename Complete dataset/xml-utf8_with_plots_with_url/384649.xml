<plot>My Opposition - The Diaries of Friedrich Kellner tells the story of two courageous and determined men. The first, Friedrich Kellner, a political activist who did all he could to stop the Nazis from obtaining power. The second, his grandson, Robert Scott Kellner who to this day uses his grandfather's diaries to alert people to the dangers of totalitarian ideologies. As a justice inspector during the Third Reich Friedrich Kellner did the only thing he could do, continue to refuse to join the Nazi Party, even at personal risk to himself, and to his wife, while secretly recording the horrific atrocities of the Nazi regime. Decades later and after a series of unfortunate events, Friedrich's grandson, Robert Scott Kellner, a petty officer in the American navy and an orphan from a very young age, nervously seeks out his Nazi grandfather only to discover a courageous opponent of the Nazis. Upon their life-changing encounter Scott makes a series of promises to his grandfather that he continues to live out to this day. One, to use the diaries as a weapon against fascism and terrorism; two, to assist other children who have been orphaned at a young age. This film re-traces Scott's trip to Germany to tell the story of his grandfather, - a man who risked his life recording one of the most horrific atrocities of the western world. It was Friedrich Kellner's hope that recording the events he witnessed would ensure that genocide never happened again. 45 and 65 minute versions available</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384649</url></doc>
