<plot>Devkishan Sharma is a school-teacher in a small town in India, where he lives with his wife, and two sons, Bhawaniprasad and Shivprasad. When he finds out that Bhawani has fallen into bad company and has taken to crime to make a livelihood, he asks him to leave the house, which he does. Then Shivprasad alias Shiva attempts, in vain, to find a job, and finally decides to re-locate to Bombay. Upon arrival he meets with an old friend, Madanlal, who subsequently tells him that Bhawani is a big businessman. Shiva goes to Bhawani, who now lives in a palatial house, and who welcomes Shiva with open arms. Then one day Shiva finds out that Bhawani is a smuggler who is wanted by the police. Before he could confront his brother, Bhawani is shot and wounded by another gangster, Jagtap, and is hospitalized in serious condition. Shiva decides to take over from Bhawani, but when Bhawani recovers, he is upset and asks Shiva to go home to mom and dad. A humiliated and enraged Shiva refuses to go home and instead joins forces with Jagtap in order to teach Bhawani a lesson. Jagtap is delighted with this and welcomes Shiva, as he knows that he will use the brothers to fight against each other - and he also knows that only one of them is going to survive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250037</url></doc>
