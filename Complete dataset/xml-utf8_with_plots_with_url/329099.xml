<plot>Lemmings is testimony to the post puberty generation knocking on the door of their 20s. The choice is now or never. Bundle your dreams into a bag and jump on the National Express bound for a student's union somewhere down the M4, or stay and drown. This is the decision that Daniel Roberts and Rob Wilfort were faced with as they grew up together in Porthcawl, a small coastal resort somewhere between Cardiff and Swansea. This film is about making the decision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329099</url></doc>
