<plot>Monte Hale has been working as a teller in a bank in Allentown, Texas during the summer to earn money for his medical college expenses during the upcoming year. He is about to leave to return to college when the bank is held up by two members of a notorious gang, headed by Marlowe, leaving Monte with the smoking gun of one of the bandits that killed the bank president. To avoid bringing disgrace on the family of his sweetheart, Julia Collins, by revealing that it was her brother Jeff, supposedly working in Denver, who induced him to open the back door of the bank to let the robbers in, Monte allows suspicion to rest on him until he can clear himself. Knowing he can't clear himself or pry Jeff loose from the gang if he is taken to jail, Monte fights his way free and escapes. He trails the Marlowe gang to Red Rock, Colorado when Julia appears and complicates the task. On her way to Denver to see Jeff, whom she still believes to be there, Julia is wounded in a stagecoach holdup by the gang, and is brought to the saloon/hotel of "Lucky" Hawkins. There Monte, using an assumed name, is forced---by the absence of the local doctor---to give medical care to Julia to save her life. The news that he is a doctor attracts the attention of Marlowe, lying wounded in a hideout in the hills. The gang kidnaps Monte who is forced to treat Marlowe's wound and afterward is kept prisoner by the gang. With the secret help of Luck and Julia, Monte manages to turn his enforced part in the Marlowe gang activities to his advantage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629233</url></doc>
