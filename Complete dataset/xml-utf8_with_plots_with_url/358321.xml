<plot>The documentary covers the highs and lows of Marimekko and where the company stands today. Some of the classic prints, such as Unikko from the 1960s are still in production. Armi Ratia, who created the company and Kirsti Paakkanen, who saved it, are the two strong women behind Marimekko. Some of the designers that they have promoted, such as Maija Isola, Fujiwo Ishimoto and Ritva Falla are stars in their own right.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?358321</url></doc>
