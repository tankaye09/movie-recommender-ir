<plot>Alchemy in Light is a multiple award winning film that combines music and cinematography for a sensual and vicarious experience about creation. The film examines the ancient craft of glass blowing from the perspective of three modern artists--a woman and two men. Beginning with sand and fire, we watch them labor at Vulcan's forge to transform the 2,000 degree honey-like material into art glass. Each artist has their unique style and technique; the life they breath into the glass is their own, and their art reflects their personality. As they work the material, the artists talk about the craft of glass blowing and working with the molten glass.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?029044</url></doc>
