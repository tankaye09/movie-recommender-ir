<plot>The city is rocked by a series of brutal murders. All the victims are women of lose character or prostitutes, and all have been brutally slain. Inspector Arjun Dutt is assigned this case, and he launches an investigation. The only clue is part of a photograph. Arjun concludes that these murders are being committed by a young man named Vikram alias Devendra. Arjun's superiors do not agree with him, and fault him. His superiors also find out that Vikram was Arjun's close friend, and both were rivals for the same woman, Kiran. The point to ponder is why would Arjun want to accuse Vikram, a man he has known since his college days, of these heinous crimes?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491095</url></doc>
