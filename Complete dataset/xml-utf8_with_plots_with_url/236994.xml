<plot>Cute doggie. Faithful pet. World-class defence lawyer. HERMAN, THE LEGAL LABRADOR is an animated film about a cute little doggie called Herman, who, in addition to being a cute little doggie, is also a criminal defence attorney. Herman lives with his owner, Chuck, an unemployed writer who is having trouble getting over his last relationship as he attempts to write his debut novella, "Death Cake Goes Back In Time". Herman attempts to console him, but his time is increasingly monopolised by the case he is working on. Herman is defending Danny, a young man on trial for murder. The evidence (and Danny's violent past) is stacked against him, and the public prosecutor, Leonard Palumbo, would like nothing better than to lock Danny up for good. However, Herman smells a smokescreen. His informant, Sal, The Hot Dog Vendor, sets him on the trail of a secret, worldwide brotherhood of evil, comprised of, among others, the Mafia, the Yakuza, the Ku Klux Klan, the Scientonomists, the Shriners, the Market Researchers Of America and the entire nation of Ireland. But can a group of the evilest people in the world really be behind this frame-up... or is the truth far stupider?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236994</url></doc>
