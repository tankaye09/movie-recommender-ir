<plot>VAJRA SKY OVER TIBET, a documentary feature, is a cinematic pilgrimage to some of the most revered venues and festivals still surviving in Tibet. This poignant journey bears witness to the indomitable faith of its endangered Buddhist community and the imminent threat to its very survival. The vastness of the Tibetan sky, reflecting snowy mountains, rushing rivers, and turquoise lakes, leads the journey west. Tibetans respond to the denial of the human right to practice one's religion without interference with a defiant devotion. As interviews were not appropriate because of likely retribution, VAJRA SKY employs the evocative voices of Tenzin Choegyal and Dadon, both Tibetans in exile. Many of Tibet's most legendary musicians and singers are featured in the compelling soundtrack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?635185</url></doc>
