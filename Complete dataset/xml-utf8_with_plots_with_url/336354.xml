<plot>Gandy Goose gets spooked reading ghost stories before bedtime. After the lights go out, he finds himself outside in the rain on patrol, where he's approached by a mysterious lady who wants to throw him a party. She escorts Gandy and Sourpuss to the mansion, which turns out to be full of spirits. They're mostly friendly, in spite of Sourpuss's refusal to join in the festivities. But the ghosts turn nasty after Sourpuss ruins the fun, and our foolish heroes are forced to run for their lives!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336354</url></doc>
