<plot>Herr Müller, recently arrived from Germany, cannot speak English, and he needs to travel across town. A German passer-by helps him to find the streetcar that he needs to take, and writes a note that will tell the conductor where Müller needs to go. After he gets on board the streetcar, the conductor reads the note and gives Müller the cross-town transfer that he will need. To help him find the next car, the conductor motions to him to follow a female passenger who has the same transfer. But when the woman decides to do some shopping before taking the cross-town car, Müller quickly finds himself in confusion and difficulty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031259</url></doc>
