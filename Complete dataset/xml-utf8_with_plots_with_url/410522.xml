<plot>A number of boys and girls are trespassing, and on being discovered, they fly in all directions. This picture shows them coming full speed down a steep hill and jumping over an embankment. Some fall and scramble to their feet in a mad effort to escape. Last of all comes the farmer, who finally catches one of the boys and gives him a good drubbing. The action in this film is fine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410522</url></doc>
