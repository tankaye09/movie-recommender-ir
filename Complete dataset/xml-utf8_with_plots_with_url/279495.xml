<plot>Josephine sets the mood; music, candles, and a steamy hot tub for a romantic evening with her boyfriend Jeffery. Unfortunately, their evening is quickly interrupted by the unexpected entrance of Josephine's Ex: Shaun. Shaun has some issues; namely he is still in love with Jo and knows that she still loves him. Jeffery, however, disagrees. An emotionally charged evening ensues with Josephine in the middle trying to sort out love, passion, friendship, and her own sense of self. This short film poses the ultimate question: Can another person possibly make us whole?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279495</url></doc>
