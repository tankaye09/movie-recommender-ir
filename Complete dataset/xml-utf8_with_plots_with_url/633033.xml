<plot>Up on the Roof follows several devoted pigeon breeders in one predominantly Latino section of Brooklyn through the rigors and rewards of a quintessential New York tradition. All along the waterfront, and throughout blue collar Brooklyn, pigeon fancying has been an active pastime for centuries, handed down from one group of residents to the next, and Williamsburg has long been the center of the action. But as with so many once blighted and now hip districts throughout the world, Brooklyn-and Williamsburg in particular-is being scrubbed of its old world character to make way for a new urbanism. This considers what we lose in the process of urban renewal and treats the audience like an insider in an unseen and -in many ways- vanishing world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?633033</url></doc>
