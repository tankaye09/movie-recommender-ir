<plot>About 20 residents of Pawtucket, R.I., line one side of a street in view of a stationary camera. Down the street toward us, at a fast clip, come the horse-drawn engines and conveyances of the town's fire department. There are transport wagons full of uniformed firefighters, a hook and ladder truck with an aft driver, and a one-horse carriage with the chief. After eight pieces of equipment go by, regular traffic resumes; several buggies follow the fire brigade as the crowd disperses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426812</url></doc>
