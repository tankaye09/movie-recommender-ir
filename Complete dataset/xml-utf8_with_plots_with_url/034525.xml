<plot>Have you ever seen a ghost? After seeing this program you can say you have... What figure appeared on horseback in the woods outside the Arianna Miles? Have your room at the Bucksville House tidied up in the morning by Colonial Maids who turn and vanish. At the Wedgewood Inn, explore a tunnel of the underground railroad where slaves passed through to freedom and some still remain. In this program you will see some of the most amazing images of spirits ever recorded-exactly as they were revealed to our cameras. Absolutely no computer generated images or post production effects or recreations were utilized in this production. Gives justice to the field of ghost hunting other documentaries fail to bring you anything other than campfire ghost stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034525</url></doc>
