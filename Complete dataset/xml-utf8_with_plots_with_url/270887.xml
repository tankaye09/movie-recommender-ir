<plot>In this video, a teenage girl struggles to define her life and her illness in a marginal, environmentally devastated neighborhood in Northern India. Inflected by her love of Bollywood music, and driven by frustration over the quality of medical care available to her, this project investigates the relationships between environment and medical practice - and between the subject and the filmmaker - as it attempts to understand one young woman's experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270887</url></doc>
