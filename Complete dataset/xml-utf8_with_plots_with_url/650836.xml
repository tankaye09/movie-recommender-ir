<plot>Set in a Jersey shore beach club, plucked straight out of the 1950's - four baby-boomer friends band together for the July 4th Week-End Mah-Jongg Extravaganza. This year's prize, along with the delectable pleasure of righting a lifelong rivalry, is a free oceanfront cabana. Intensive Mah-Jongg 101 training begins...and the fellowship of four set the tournament in-play. But, did they get more than they bargained for? How does taking a chance at the tables...lead to taking a chance at life?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650836</url></doc>
