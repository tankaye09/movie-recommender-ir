<plot>This made-for-DVD documentary details the work that went into the production of Kung Fu, the 70's TV series about a shaolin monk who wanders the American old west. Series fans are treated to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of this drama about a man trained to discipline his temper but who must fight for what is right, as well as to interviews with star David Carradine and others working in the industry at the time, who give their insights into the efforts that were needed to bring the series together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204905</url></doc>
