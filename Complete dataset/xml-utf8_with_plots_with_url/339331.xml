<plot>As one of the first films about AIDS to be nationally televised on PBS, Living With AIDS tells the compelling story of Todd Coleman, a 22 year old gay man with AIDS, and those who cared for him during the last weeks of his life. Todd, his lover, doctor, nurse, social worker and two volunteers reveal the human realities and the importance of practical support, friendship and unconditional love. Filmed both before and after Todd's death, Living With AIDS shows the full scope of the disease's effect on a patient and his care partners and provides a model for compassionate community response to the AIDS epidemic. Living With AIDS was broadcast on P.O.V., PBS's premiere showcase for independent documentaries, the Sundance Channel and foreign television. It has also been screened at film festivals and cultural institutions around the world. Living With AIDS was funded in part by the Louis B. Mayer Film Fellowship, the Funding Exchange, the Pioneer Fund and the Chicago Resource Center.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339331</url></doc>
