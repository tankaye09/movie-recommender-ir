<plot>Dana Plays uses point of view construction and match action to situate the viewer in the cement encased riverbed, its surrounding overpasses, bridges and rail yards, by cross cutting between scenes from various Hollywood movies shot on location in the Los Angeles River. The River is transformed to the ultimate urban location, a place to find refuge, retribution and revenge; a place of death, violence and danger, a place for love, and for familia. A project of Re-envisioning the Los Angeles River, and Friends of the Los Angeles River.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?464710</url></doc>
