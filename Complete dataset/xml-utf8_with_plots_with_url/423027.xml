<plot>Duane Lodge is so incompetent he can't even manage his own suicide. Then workmen dig a hole in the road outside his dilapidated home, transforming his life and his neighbourhood. Through a series of accidents and deliberate, if mischievous acts, the hole fills with water and creates a pond in the middle of the road where children come to play and flowers grow. Duane is tested by city authorities threatening to fill in the pond and fights for true love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423027</url></doc>
