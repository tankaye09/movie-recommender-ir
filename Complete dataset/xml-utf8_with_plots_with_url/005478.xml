<plot>4 squared is a comedy about four groups of four friends. Our first group is four normal guys trying to get rich quick. We follow them as they have their ups and downs, but eventually come out on top. The next four protagonists are avid D&amp;D players; we can see their story unfold through a series of flashbacks and learn that they might not all be as good friend as they may have thought. In the next story four jocks try to stay popular, and get dates even though they seem to have forgotten what really matters in life. Their story is narrated by one of their own. Our last four are the best of friends, and all they want is dates to the dance, even though they all know they don't stand a chance in the dating world.</plot><plot>4 squared is a comedy about four groups of four friends.
