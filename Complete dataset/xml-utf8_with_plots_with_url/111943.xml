<plot>DOG used to run a highly profitable team of international telephone fraudsters, until he was chased into hiding by a hit-man. With little human contact and only a white crow for company, Dog has survived only on paranoia and memories.Now, two years later, he's still alive and desperate to live. He's had time to re-evaluate his life, and realizes that he doesn't understand most people's idea of normality; but the lure of the buzz, the money and the bullshit is too much: He wants to get his old team together again for one last pitch.So now he's back on the case, putting together a massive telephone scam, and we're there to witness it in detail so accurate, it's almost a beginners guide to telephone fraud! But will this lifestyle still provide him with the illusions he needs to believe in himself?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111943</url></doc>
