<plot>When London-based Sam Higgins goes missing in the Ladakh region of India, his friend, Dev Anand, travels there in order to locate him. He finds this region to be quite different from the rest of India, as a matter of fact, Indians are regarded with suspicion and distrust, while the majority of the population appears to be Spanish, Italians, and other foreign nationals. The region does have a Police Station, but they are of no help to Dev, on the contrary they suspect him of being a smuggler of illicit drugs and ammunition. Dev's inquiries lead to conclude that he must meet a mysterious man named "Policeman" who has taken over the region and is feared by everyone. He also finds out that this region is well-known for attracting foreigners as opium is grown in vast quantities. As Dev starts to delve into these details, quite unknown to him, he himself has become a target for the dreaded "Policeman", and may not even live long enough to find out what happened to Sam Higgins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100056</url></doc>
