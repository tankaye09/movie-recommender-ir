<plot>Travel off the beaten path with Vincent Price as he unearths the strange plays and bizarre players who have inhabited the NFL for the past half century. Step right up and see for yourself the one-eyed quarterback who led the NFL in passing one year. Meet the player whose diet consisted of blood and raw meat. See weird team rituals. The strangest games. Discover the fattest achievers who ever played. And relive such out-of-this-world plays as "the Holy Roller," "The Immaculate Reception" and "The Miracle of the Meadowlands."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517258</url></doc>
