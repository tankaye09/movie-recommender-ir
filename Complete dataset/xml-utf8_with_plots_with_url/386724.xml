<plot>"Shows the despatch boat of the 'New York Journal' steaming through the water, having aboard the war correspondents. This is one of the fastest yachts engaged in the business. She approaches rapidly and as she cuts through the sea her prow throws the water in a white spray on either side. This is an excellent picture of a good subject. The bow waves are especially fine."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?386724</url></doc>
