<plot>Oleg Gromov loses his wife and only son in an accident. The top-notch Moscow surgeon burns his boats-he sells his country place for a song, locks up his posh apartment, and throws his mobile phone down the refuse chute to start from scratch in a tiny backwoods town. He becomes an obscure physician on ambulance Team Eight, with Potapych the driver, doctor's assistant Nadezhda, and paramedic Yuri. Each of the sixteen episodes is a kaleidoscopic arrangement of people and their dramas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034221</url></doc>
