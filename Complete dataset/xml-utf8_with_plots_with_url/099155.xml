<plot>Ramachandra Mangaraj, a wily village zamindar, eyes a small plot of land belonging to a weaver couple. Conspiring together with his concubine, the priest and the barber, he exploits their simple trust in the village goddess's power. Together they plot and entrust upon the couple that they would be blessed with children if they build a temple for the Goddess. He defrauds them of their six acres and a third by taking it as mortgage and later ruining them both in the process of acquiring the piece of land. Though the zamindar's wife is against all this. Barely six months later he is himself ruined through a concatenation of events, losing his estate to his lawyer Ram Ram Lala and eventually his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099155</url></doc>
