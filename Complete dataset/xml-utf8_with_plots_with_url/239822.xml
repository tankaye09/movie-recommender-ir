<plot>HINDSIGHT is the sometimes sad, sometimes humorous story of Walt, a young man alienated from those around him by his special ability to actually experience their inner thoughts. It's an ability he's always had, and it's something that's radically affected his view not only of others, but also of himself. Which is why Walt's world begins to turn upside down when he discovers his power is starting to fade. It's at this time he also meets Jen, an unusual and engaging young woman who helps him negotiate the painful transition from isolation to connection. A curious and original look at the effects of a disability and the struggle to cope with a world where everyone else is different from you.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239822</url></doc>
