<plot>Near Vienna, along the Blue Danube, men compete on dirt tracks riding specialized motorcycles in short, high-speed races. This short follows a new rider, Hughmeyer, from his first day to his first race. The track mechanics teach him the cycle's assembly: it's alcohol fueled, with no brakes and no gears. He puts a steel-lined boot on his left foot so he can use it as a strut as he rounds curves. Then, wearing his helmet, he navigates the practice track. Few make it this far, and fewer still get to race. Although Hughmeyer doesn't win his first race, he does survive the 90-mile-per-hour straight-aways and the 60-mile-per-hour turns.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151126</url></doc>
