<plot>This piece of scenery was taken in the Albert Ca√±on on the line of the Canadian Pacific R.R., and is considered to be one of the finest views in the Rocky Mountains. The chief big features of these pictures are the towering cliffs which rise straight up thousands of feet on either side, and between which runs a river, adding materially to the interest of the view, and passing through a tunnel hewn out of solid rock which can be seen from a distance of nearly a mile during the time of the approach of the train, forms a very interesting climax to this picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422074</url></doc>
