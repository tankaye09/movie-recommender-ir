<plot>Recently released from prison, Min-kyu works as an electrician climbing telephone poles scattered in the dismal Changshin-dong. He notices one day that there is an intruder in his private world. Da-hye has started posting missing person leaflets. Min-kyu begins to remove them one by one. But to his consternation, Da-hye keeps replacing the ones he has removed. Da-hye's only goal in life is to find her missing brother. She lives hand-to-mouth but that is the least of her problems. She is also slowly losing her sight. Min-kyu and Da-hye find themselves drawn to one another by their pain and loneliness to somehow find a way to heal each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268286</url></doc>
