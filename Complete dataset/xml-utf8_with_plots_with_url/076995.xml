<plot>A documentary that follows British man Dave Cornthwaite and his team as he attempts to skateboard 6000kms from Perth to Brisbane, across Australia. This epic journey is a world record attempt, a personal challenge and a breathtaking, emotional trial for everyone involved. From his starting point on the stunning west coast, Dave will face the searing heat of the Nullabor desert, the high winds of The Great Ocean Road, the tortuous climbs over the mountains of The Great Dividing range and will have to travel further on a skateboard than anyone in history to reach his goal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076995</url></doc>
