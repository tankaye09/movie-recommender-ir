<plot>Little Egypt was the stage name for two popular exotic dancers. They had so many imitators, the name became synonymous with exotic dancers generally. In 1893, at the Egyptian Theater on the World's Columbian Exposition Midway in Chicago, Raqs dancers performed for the first time in the United States.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338028</url></doc>
