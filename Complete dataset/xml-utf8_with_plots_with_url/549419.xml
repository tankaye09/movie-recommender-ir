<plot>"The Cole Nobody Knows" is a documentary on Chicago-native Freddy Cole, the lesser-known, yet equally talented younger brother of Nat "King" Cole. At age 75, Freddy Cole is, at last, being widely recognized for his amazing musical talent. The film examines the complicated journey of creating a career in the shadow of a famous sibling. Mr. Cole's story is told through interviews with Mr. Cole, Monty Alexander, Nancy Wilson, David "Fathead" Newman, John di Martino, H Johnson, Carl Anthony and many others. Photographed in Atlanta, New York City, New Jersey, Los Angeles, Switzerland &amp; France, "The Cole Nobody Knows" also offers a reinvigorating journey through the "Great American Songbook" by offering extraordinary, live performance material with Freddy Cole and his quartet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?549419</url></doc>
