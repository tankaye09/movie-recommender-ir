<plot>Having just turned thirty years old, former high school star athlete TYLER WELLS is having trouble settling into his comfortable, middle class life. With a baby on the way and his job at a local plant hanging in the balance, he goes for one last roar of the crowd by entering The Iron Masters King of the Ring Contest, a brutal fight contest where the winner fights four fights in one night. When his troubled younger brother GABE enters, Tyler finds himself fighting not only his past present and future, but his own flesh and blood as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568413</url></doc>
