<plot>Traveling from morning to night, "Sandcastles" chronicles a day in the life of a construction worker named Getz. Getz wakes up alongside a highway. His wallet and cell-phone are missing. With no recollection of the previous night, he returns home. On his answering machine he finds a message from himself...to himself: "I called you out of work today." For a laborer who's devoted his entire, lonely life to his work and has, for years, worked seven-day weeks, this is a first. And with his routine disrupted, Getz can't help but puzzle over the riddle of his self-excused absence. All he knows is that it has something to do with Karina, whom he met at a bookstore months earlier, and Virgil, whom he's never heard of, but whose name now appears on his cell-phone's greeting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476366</url></doc>
