<plot>Two friends meet up for a night on the town. They visit a local bar, where their buddy's the bartender, hoping to hook up with random women. Their buddy has 'scoped' the scene and found two promising candidates. The young men 'pick up' the women for a night of promiscuity. Upon arriving at their apartments the two couples begin to 'make out'. As their situations heat up, both men are presented condoms by their respective lady. The decision for the men is whether or not to comply. What lies ahead is the realization of the consequences of their decisions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548590</url></doc>
