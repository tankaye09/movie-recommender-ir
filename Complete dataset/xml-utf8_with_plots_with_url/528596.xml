<plot>While on a yacht trip along with this daughter, Dolly, Indian army Major Krishna Rao, observes a girl in distress and goes to rescue her. He ends up rescuing dozens of girls, who have been entrapped by General Dong. While the girls manage to escape, he and Dolly are captured. Dong cuts off Krishna's ankle and gives him one year to come and rescue his daughter. Krishna goes to get an artificial limb, and returns to India to find out that Dong has been successful in assassinating General Sinha. Brig. Kapoor arranges for a small unit to stop Dong, which include Anju Sinha, Rakesh, Ranbir Chauhan, and Javed, all with the rank of Captain. They enlist the help of disgraced Ex-Major Dharam Singh and travel to the border region between China and India. What this group does not know is that their secret mission has been leaked to Dong - who is now awaiting their arrival, along with his army of men, and women suicide bombers, and his very own clones - and Dong means business - and Dong is never wrong!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?528596</url></doc>
