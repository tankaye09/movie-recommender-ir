<plot>Powerful visions and terrible realities chase Paul Finn around these days. All he has is a group of misfit friends who are determined to convince him the truth hides somewhere inside himself. Finn doesn't know what he's looking for, and he doesn't really care. All he needs is the sky above him, the earth beneath him, a few eccentric friends, and a bag of memories. But when he meets a strangely compelling woman, his life starts to move in fantastic new directions. Finn soon finds he has been living a lie when his friends rapidly piece the events of his past together into a story he can hardly believe. His journey toward the truth will take him to weird and wonderful places, inhabited by good, evil, and surrounded by timeless beauty. Will Finn be able to reclaim the identity, lost to himself, that his friends claim he has forgotten for centuries? Does he have the courage and strength to stand up to the real truth that resides inside, hidden somewhere behind the lies he's been telling himself? Tied in with the ageless stories of the Irish Celtic Mythos, The Finnian Cycle is about finding our place in the world. A powerful story full of spectacular images, laughter, hope, and despair, it will leave you questioning what is real and what you must do to discover it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557804</url></doc>
