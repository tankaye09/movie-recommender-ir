<plot>Set against the backdrop of a late 1970's South Africa, this is the little-known story of white South African Tim Jenkin and his incarcerated ANC supporting comrades that starts with an 'escape proof' prison and ends with a handful of intricately fashioned wooden keys, a relentless manhunt and humiliation for the apartheid regime. Smuggled money, gallows trap doors, life sentences, divided comrades, daring and determination, killer guard dogs, close calls, and doors that only open from the outside, INSIDE OUT - ESCAPE FROM PRETORIA is a story of how patience, single-mindedness, friendship, sacrifice, commitment and ingenuity got the prisoners out of their cells and through 10 locked doors to freedom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266100</url></doc>
