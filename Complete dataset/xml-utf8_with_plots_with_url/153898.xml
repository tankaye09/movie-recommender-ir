<plot>"DOG" takes place in a world that is dead, ravaged by a war so ancient that the only movements are convulsive flickers of memory; flak bursts in the sky, trucks transport fresh soldiers to the front. But the artillery is unmanned, and the soldiers being transported to the front were skeletons long, long ago. The main characters are a dog, a critter, and an old man. There are two worlds in "DOG"; a sterile landscape of desert and ruined overpasses haunted by the memory of war, and a terrible sunless nether land haunted by singing fish...and other things. Both owe a debt to the landscape of Scotland's industrial belt. Whilst the relationships in "DOG" are intended to be ambiguous, the Dog's journey is motivated by the possibility of hope, and the narrative hangs around an unlikely friendship formed under unfortunate circumstances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153898</url></doc>
