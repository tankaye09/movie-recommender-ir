<plot>The horses and their riders jump the hurdles in very rapid succession, clearing both hurdle and the stream very gracefully. A very unfortunate occurrence takes place at the ending of the picture, when one of the horses in making the jump does not clear the stream. He falls very heavily upon the bank, throwing the rider violently to the ground. Although the occurrence is unfortunate for the rider, it adds great excitement to the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281486</url></doc>
