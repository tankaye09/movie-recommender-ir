<plot>Why does a 19 year-old girl plot to kill her own father? Katrina Skinner is stuck in suburbia with her toddler daughter and her devoted dad. Her brother Danny is in jail for life for murder. Her mother abandoned her years ago. The neighbours are scared of her. The police can't keep up with her. Nobody can control her but everybody's trying. Her dad won't mind his own business... Katrina misses her brother. She needs money for his appeal. She's bored and she's sick of living with her dad. She's not going to work a day in her life and she knows her dad's not going to help her financially anymore. She's first in line for the family inheritance. All she needs to do now is convince one of her lovers to do the deed and she's never had much trouble getting men to do what she wants. All for the love of her brother. We open our film at the funeral of John Skinner, inside the Golden Grove Crematorium. Kat sits on the front pew between her cheeky fiancé Rusty and her toddler daughter Bailee. Her mobile phone interrupts the service when she receives a text message. Her family glares at her as she reads it; WANNA FUCK? She giggles, and suddenly we are thrust into Katrina's world: youth culture, crime, sex and suburban mayhem. This story is told from many perspectives: a kaleidoscope of flashbacks and testimonies fueled by small town gossip, the police, friends and family, her fiancé, and her many lovers. It seems everybody has a "story" to tell about Katrina Skinner. The stories don't add up, but they all take us to the same place. After hearing the screams of her father in the next room Kat knew it was over. Finally! No-one would believe that she could do it, and now that it was done she couldn't believe how easy it was! She closed the door to John's room, put a Mr Squiggle video on for her little daughter then joined the killer in the kitchen for an orange juice and a cigarette. A girl without conscience, a world without morals. A family destroyed and a daughter getting away with murder. This is a sexy black comedy drama. "I knew the grandmother, she was mad - I knew the mother, she was madder. It's genetics I reckon, that's the only thing I can come up with. You can't get clean water from a dirty tank."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?519868</url></doc>
