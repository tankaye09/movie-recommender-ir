<plot>Shows a scene on the deck of a Japanese Battleship, with the crew ranged around two fencers. The combatants are very active and quick in their movements, and each in turn is brought to his knees by the force of his opponent's onslaught. It shows the very vigorous form of exercise indulged in by the Japanese Navy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274002</url></doc>
