<plot>Nicola Six has been psychic all her life, having even foretold her parents' death in a plane crash when she was only 18. Plagued with dreams that she will be murdered on the eve of Her 35th Birthday, she is now in that final year where she strives to determine who her would-be murderer is. She has narrowed it down to one of four men she meets at the Black Cross Pub. The slice on this short film is Nicola interacting with two of her suspects, dart champion Keith Talent and businessman Guy Clinch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420303</url></doc>
