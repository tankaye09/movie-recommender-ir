<plot>Jobless, homeless and starving Freddie Joyzelle is saved by Mike Fall from the clutches of a masher, and is then invited to stay with him and his musician partners for at least two weeks. The four men call themselves The Four Seasons because of their surnames: there is also Joe Spring, Happy Winter and Pete Summer. Besides joining their group as a violinist, Freddie cooks and cleans for them and even gets them a gig at the Little Aregon restaurant after they are fired for asking for a raise at their old job. She is from the country of Aregon and knows the owner, Mr. Keppel, also from Aregon. When Prince Nicholaus of Aregon pays a visit to the restaurant and recognizes Freddie, he kisses her on the forehead, creating front page news that makes the restaurant famous. Keppel decides to open a larger restaurant because of the increase in business. Although Mike and Freddie love each other, Mike gets jealous at the attention Freddie gives the Prince, and quits the group two hours before the grand opening.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518031</url></doc>
