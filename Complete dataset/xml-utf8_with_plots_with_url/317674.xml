<plot>Raja lives a wealthy lifestyle with his somewhat upper Caste Hindu, eccentric, woman-hating dad, Hazurdas, and mom. He is friendly with Kishore, and both are aspiring doctors. On their way to college, they meet with two young women, Rani Mehra and Kamini. Both young men fall in love with them, with Raja taking the first initiative and getting married to Kamini, even though she of a lower untouchable Caste, but decides not to tell his parents. When he does inform them, they want him to divorce Kamini and get married to a girl of their choice, Raja refuses and returns back to Kamini, only to find her in the arms of her childhood friend, Sunder. Angered and hurt at this betrayal, he decides to marry the girl his parents have chosen for him - and he is due for another surprise - as the girl he is about to wed is none other than Kamini's friend, Rani. Watch what happens when a liberated, tom-boyish Rani finds out that Raja is already married, and the impact this has on everyone concerned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317674</url></doc>
