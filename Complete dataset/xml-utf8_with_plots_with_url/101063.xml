<plot>In this high-school coming of age romantic comedy and with 2 months of summer vacation ahead of them, fresh graduates Kiki and Kammy swear to look for their first boyfriends and bring them to show their schoolmates at the high school reunion. First Kammy meets the 40-year-old Danny and falls head over heels. Danny, who gets paranoid and makes a scene while they watch "Der Lift" (a black &amp; white German horror movie) and hallucinates about being the actor in the film, has not the courage to face a girl half his age. Kiki falls in love at first sight with a handsome basket ball player called Fung, only to find that she is just one of his many admirers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101063</url></doc>
