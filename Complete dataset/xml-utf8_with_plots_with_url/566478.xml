<plot>In 2000, Palestinians could go into Israel on tours. About 20 people take a three-day trip through Galilee to the Lebanon boarder and then to Tel Aviv and Jaffa. They visit a kibbutz, a fort built during the Crusades, and the Mediterranean at Acra. We hear conversations about occupation and loss. Several have been in Israeli prisons. One visits the Rabin Memorial in Tel Aviv and tells a story about him. Another sees his mother in Lebanon through barbed wire. One woman's husband was gunned down by Israeli soldiers while walking home; another's husband serves a life sentence for killing an Israeli solder. An old man walks under a trestle and across a field to his father's grave.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566478</url></doc>
