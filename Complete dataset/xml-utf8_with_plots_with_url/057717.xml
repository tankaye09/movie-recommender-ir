<plot>Athlete and artist. Dedication and drive. Body and soul. A prima ballerina is born from this sophisticated fusion ... and to make it they've got to have it all before they've even had their first date. Through the eyes of a handful of young hopefuls from across Canada and around the world, BALLET GIRLS captures the heartbreak of loss and the conviction of spirit required to become a member of the world-renowned Royal Winnipeg Ballet. This 3 x one-hour documentary series goes behind the scenes, from the open audition room where girls pli√© and pirouette for coveted spots within the RWB Summer School, to the drama and painstaking realities of actually living the dream. The series culminates with a triumphant performance for one aspiring ballerina as Clara in the company's annual production of The Nutcracker.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057717</url></doc>
