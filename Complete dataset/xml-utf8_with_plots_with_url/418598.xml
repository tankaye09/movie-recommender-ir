<plot>Outside In is a short film with a serious message about social decorum and behavior. At what point does playful joking become abrasive bullying and torment? How responsible are we for our words and actions? In Outside In, a young college student named Zack nonchalantly bullies one of his peers, Evan. After numerous encounters, Zack awakens to his errors in judgment, seeing the potential catastrophic result of his thoughtlessness and cruelty. Bullying is present today in high schools and colleges across the country. It takes place both in person and on the internet and has been responsible for many suicides and high school shootings. This timely five-minute film takes the audience into the mind of both the victim and the aggressor. The viewer will experience a heightened sensitivity to the harmful nature of bullying. Outside In was made at a high school summer program at New York University and has been accepted to the Kent Film Festival.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418598</url></doc>
