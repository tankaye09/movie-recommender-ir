<plot>On a jewel of an Island floating in the Caribbean Sea, William Shakespeare's "Macbeth" is retold using a fictitious "modern day" monarchy as its backdrop. In this setting where West Indians rule independently over a West Indian population, this universal and relevant story will come alive, in a tale filled with SEX, VIOLENCE and POETRY. After winning a gallant military victory over rebels fighting in opposition to King Duncan, the adored ruler of the souvenir nation of Antibes. General Macbett encounters the "Weird Sisters" the spirit daughters of Mother Africa who reign over fire, water, earth and sky. They delight in manipulating the mortal Macbett by feeding him predictions of royal titles including "King". He soon becomes obsessed with ambition as does his beautiful and ruthless wife, Lady Macbett. After killing the King and indulging in numerous political assassinations, Macbett and his Lady are haunted by their murderous deeds, leading him to be tragically defeated by his own zealous thirst for power, a heartbreaking end to a once beloved Hero.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350090</url></doc>
