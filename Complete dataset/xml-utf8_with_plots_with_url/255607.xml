<plot>Each year a new edition of the Ice Capades would skate into L.A. and the odds were high that both Ralph Staub (for Screen Snapshots) and Pete Smith (for his Specials) would show up and make a Short of the opening show.

The show always had a clown act or two, so Smith concentrated on them, while Staub would go ga-ga over the movie stars in attendance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255607</url></doc>
