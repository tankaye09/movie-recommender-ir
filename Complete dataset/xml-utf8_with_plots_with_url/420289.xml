<plot>Another of the pictures taken at the Delhi Durbar in India. The pageant is made up of gorgeously decorated elephants, on the backs of which are the howdahs in which the Indian Princes and Princesses are seated. The route is lined with East Indian and English soldiers. On the head of each elephant there is an attendant with a large fan, which is used to keep the flies and other insects from annoying the huge beasts. There are also a number of attendants marching on foot alongside the elephants. These carry the ladders which are used in reaching and alighting from the howdahs. This is an excellent view of the procession and is sure to please an audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420289</url></doc>
