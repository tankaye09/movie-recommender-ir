<plot>Nikki is invited to the wedding shower of a college friend, Kim, who she hasn't seen in several years. She is reluctant to go but decides to attend at the last minute. When she arrives, she finds that Kim is not there yet but all of her (identical) blond sisters are, and they aren't very welcoming. As they all wait for Kim to arrive the sisters begin a psychological attack on Nikki's appearance. She decides to leave but the sisters aren't willing to let their prey go so easily.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?552345</url></doc>
