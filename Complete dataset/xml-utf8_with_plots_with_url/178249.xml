<plot>This edition of "The March of Time" details in on the issue of Holland and its Far East colonies as a problem of world importance. It shows how Holland, a small European country ruled by a monarchy, is having difficulty in ruling her Asiatic colonies. It shows that the Dutch, at home, are making gigantic efforts to erase the effects of WW II, but are having difficulties without the wealth of the Dutch East Indies. It then views the conflict that is rising between the Dutch and the newly-formed government of the Republic of Indonesia. A current view of a map of Asia compared to the map in 1947 stresses the point that time, indeed, does march on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178249</url></doc>
