<plot>This is very piquant and amusing. At first we see the widow weeping for her dear departed, whose picture she is sadly contemplating. In comes her maid with a card. The widow brightens up at once. She rapidly dries her eyes, powders her nose, surveys herself in the mirror, and then gaily receives the caller, a young man. The change in emotion is exceedingly effective.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600968</url></doc>
