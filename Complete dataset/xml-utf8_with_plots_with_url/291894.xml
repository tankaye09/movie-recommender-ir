<plot>A woman alone in a rain-swept cabin is shocked by her attraction to a bizarre picture that she took that day in the woods. Shot entirely on one set, in one room, "Killing Off" blurs the line between fantasy and reality. It is a glimpse into the mind of a woman and a repressed memory: the root of her fantasies and nightmares. Dark and twisting, it's a disturbing psychological thriller that ends in the ultimate nexus of sex and death. "Killing Off" marks the directorial debut of Jud Cremata, and a reunion of talented artists from the prestigious School of Cinema-Television at the University of Southern California.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291894</url></doc>
