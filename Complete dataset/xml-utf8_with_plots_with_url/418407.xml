<plot>Home &amp; Garden Television and Screen Door Entertainment present Outer Spaces an exciting new weekly half hour series where you conspire with our design team and host to give your spouse, friend or relative the backyard of their dreams. With cameras rolling, our host and crew arrive at their home and start work, to the complete astonishment and utter amazement of our 'victim.' They'll be whisked away for the night and when they return, the new garden is revealed. The space they've always imagined brought to life with a little help from our crew and you! The producers of the new series Outer Spaces are on the lookout for family members or friends who would like to secretly give the gift of an outdoor makeover to someone special.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418407</url></doc>
