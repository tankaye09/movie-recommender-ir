<plot>Bombay-based Anjali Aggarwal lives a wealthy lifestyle with her mom, Asha, and dad, Ajit, who is the owner of Aggarwal Industries. When Asha challenges Ajit that she can run the business better, he accepts the challenge, and Asha is determined to do better than him. Her plan is to expand into a small island called Manjira located in the Indian Ocean off of Lakhwadeep Islands, and build a factory there. She finds out that the island natives are opposed to any construction of any kind. She decides to send her to-be son-in-law, Shekhar Panchotia, but when he meets with an accident, Anjali goes in his place, flies Uncle D'Silva's plane, films a murder by Gwana and his men, crash-lands, is rescued by Kishan Khanna alias Captain and returned safely to her worried parents, who are grateful to Kishan and they invite him to visit them in Bombay. Kishan does accept their invitation and goes to visit them, rescues Anjali when she is abducted by Gwana and his men, and both fall in love with each other. On the day they are to be engaged to each other, Asha and Shekhar find out that Kishan had only seduced Anjali so that he could get Aggarwal family to change their mind about building a factory in Manjira. Watch what happens when Anjali finds out, and the impact this has on her and on the Aggarwals.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473508</url></doc>
