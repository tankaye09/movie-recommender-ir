<plot>A good-natured Irish cook has the misfortune to break a dish and is severely taken to task by her mistress. The cook resents the treatment she is receiving and proceeds to break other dishes. The mistress then calls a policeman, who endeavors to put the cook out. A very comical fight ensues, in which the cook gets all the best of it, the policeman being thrown bodily out of the window. As he lands and ruefully rubs his limbs, the triumphant face of the cook appears at the window. An excellent comedy scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195777</url></doc>
