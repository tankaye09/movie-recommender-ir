<plot>Widower Rajjan lives a wealthy lifestyle in a mansion called 'Lakshmi Bhavan' all by himself after the tragic passing of his daughter. He runs a match factory called Kabutar (Dove) which does very well. It is then he meets with Pratima, her husband, Chander, and daughter, Rani, who reminds of his late daughter. He decides to indirectly assist Chander in his own business venture which ironically includes running a match factory called 'Eagle'. Chander does so well that Rajjan starts losing all his customers and soon must declare bankruptcy. 'Lakshmi Bhavan' is sold to none other than Chander himself for 25 Lakhs, and Rajjan moves to the outhouse. Soon Chander starts to liven things up including drinking alcohol and having lavish parties with dancing girls which does not auger very well with Rajjan - who had always treated this mansion as a holy place. Rajjan decides to ask Chander to stop not knowing that in so doing he will set off a chain of events that will change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490461</url></doc>
