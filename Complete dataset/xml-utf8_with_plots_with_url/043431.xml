<plot>Akash is a honest and educated young man, employed by the Bombay Municipal Corporation as a clerk. He lives with his equally honest brother, his sister-in-law, a niece, Sharda, and a nephew. Due to Akash's honesty he becomes a liability to his corrupt superiors. One day they find fault with his work, and dismiss him. When Akash attempts to assert himself legally, he finds that there is corruption everywhere. In retaliation, even his brother is implicated in a crime, and arrested. Now Akash must come up with a way to clear his brother, as well as expose the wrong-doers, but will he able to do so in this lifetime?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043431</url></doc>
