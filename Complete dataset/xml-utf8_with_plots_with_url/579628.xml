<plot>In Annie's living room. Upstairs is her demanding, invalid, mother. Annie's chatty brother Reg and his anal-retentive wife Sarah arrive to give Annie the weekend off, little knowing that she's arranged an assignation in East Grinsted with Norman, the husband of Ruth, Reg and Annie's successful sister. Their plans go awry and Norman stays there for the weekend, trying for a grope here or there with Annie. Ruth also arrives unexpectedly, so Norman flirts with her as well, while Sarah tries vainly to keep things organized and the dim veterinarian neighbor Tom comes by the see Annie and chat. As people pass in and out of the sitting room, Norman even makes a pass at Sarah.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579628</url></doc>
