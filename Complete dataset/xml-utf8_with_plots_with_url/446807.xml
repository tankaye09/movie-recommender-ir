<plot>Based on the Top Cow comic created by Roger Mincheff, "Proximity Effect" is the story of Caleb and Lisa, ordinary strangers who meet and discover the extraordinary powers they only possess when together. Unbeknownst to them they are Source and Siphon, a phenomenon that dates back to, and is indeed responsible for, the dawn of man itself; a phenomenon that can spark a Renaissance or fuel a Holocaust. Da Vinci and De Medici. Hitler and Eva Braun. Although the Siphon has the power, it is the Source that provides it. Because there are no more than 5 Sources on the planet at a time, most of the several thousand Siphons will never know of the power locked within them. Those that do, will do anything to keep that power flowing. Caleb and Lisa learn this the hard way, when they turn to a powerful and desperate Siphon for help against the secret society sworn to eliminate all Sources. Hunted from all sides, they will only survive by mastering the power themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446807</url></doc>
