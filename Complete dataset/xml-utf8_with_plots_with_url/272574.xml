<plot>The slave trade of young Bangladeshi women and children, which continues unabated, has been impressively presented by Gazdar and his team and the well-researched film thoroughly exposes the criminal activities of slave merchants and the nefarious designs of the law-enforcers. The mode of transport of the women slaves, their miserable existence, forced marriages, physical torture and callous attitudes of the governments towards the whole issue have been explicitly presented in the film. The director has taken pains to trace the tale of horror from the crime's den - Dhaka - and how the women are bought and brought all the way to Delhi or Karachi. It contains views and observations of a number of Bengali and Nepalese social workers as well who, apart from acknowledging the problem, sound desperate for governments' co-operation in ridding the society of this evil business.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272574</url></doc>
