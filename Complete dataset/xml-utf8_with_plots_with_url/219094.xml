<plot>The summer before he is due to start college, a conflicted Kyle Rowe is trying to take his new band to the next level. To that end he has just made a big decision: to fire his singer Delia and replace her with the highly-regarded (if enigmatic) Louise Belmont, who has recently left her hotly-tipped band under mysterious circumstances. Kyle's older sister Laila, however, drummer in the band and close friends with Delia is certain to be furious with the decision Meanwhile, bassist Nadine has a desperate secret of her own that she is not going to be able to keep from Laila much longer. For her part, Louise is trying to put her best face forward by ingratiating herself with her new band-mates while avoiding any discussion of precisely why she left her previous band. As the four musicians with their conflicting agendas and priorities come tentatively together to try and make the best music they can, circumstances conspire overtly and covertly to break them apart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219094</url></doc>
