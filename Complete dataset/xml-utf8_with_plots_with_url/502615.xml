<plot>Perhaps seeking a father figure as a result of childhood abandonment, Michael, who's about 35, carries on with older men a mix of affairs, one-night stands, and casual sex in public toilets. Joe, from whom he has recently broken, abuses him; his latest flame, a police detective, ignores him. His and his twin Joey's birthday approaches, and it triggers memories of their childhood and their illnesses at age seven, leaving Michael a bad heart and retarding Joey's mental development. He buys a birthday present for Joey, but in his melancholy, arrives late after his brother is sleeping. His mother still mourns her husband's leaving. A crisis and resolution ensue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502615</url></doc>
