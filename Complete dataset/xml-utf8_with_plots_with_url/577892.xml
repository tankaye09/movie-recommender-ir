<plot>A select group of people, apparently strangers to one another, are invited for a free weekend at the newly opened Lynch Cross Moorland Hotel. The owner and manager, Harry Scott-Forbes, has much on his mind however. Apart from having just opened a new business, he's concerned about a news clipping he's found about a murderess who escaped from prison some months before and begins to wonder if that person might be their cook, Monica Dawes. The group is snowed in and the telephone is out of order so when Harry is found dead, the guests begin to wonder who among them is the murderer. One of the guests, Bernard Smith, also makes the connection between all of them and realizes that they were all involved in the trial of a woman who subsequently committed suicide. Is someone out for revenge?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577892</url></doc>
