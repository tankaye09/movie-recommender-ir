<plot>A tale of power struggles in the contemporary American family.     A midwestern husband (with a proper midwestern love for meat) finds himself in the clutches of a forced diet mandated by his wife.  Desperately longing for a taste of greasy, fatty steak but unable to stand up to his wife's threats, blackmail and bland salads, the husband takes to trolling for half-eaten burgers in the company trash.  Unfortunately, his wife has him followed and every time he gets near a piece of juicy sumptuous flesh, there's someone lurking in the shadows.     Plagued by repeated carnivorous interuptus and tortured by the planning of a barbecue he knows he can't attend, the husband breaks, fleeing his house in search of joyous, artery-clogging meat.  With his wife on the treadmill, he has six minutes to get out, get some meat, and get back in.   </plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?149866</url></doc>
