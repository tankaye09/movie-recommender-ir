<plot>Irene and Gabe find their relationship to be claustrophobic. As a way to vent, they begin to imagine that other people are interested in them and start to lead delusional lives. Their delusions then become shared and there are characters who both main characters interact with as though they were real. These delusions begin to get the best of their psyches as they even begin to pick up the vices of these imagined characters. They finally decide to visit a marriage counselor, who figures out how to solve the problem in an original and interesting way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119886</url></doc>
