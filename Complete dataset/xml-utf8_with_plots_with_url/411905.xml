<plot>Sean Lamont (Michael Fordyce) does. And he's out to prove it in what critics are claiming as 'a sad comedy about happiness.' Sean has never been lucky in love and has a long list of ex-girlfriends to prove it. However, fate appears to shine on him one day when he spies Ashley (Kelly Joyce) in a cafe, but she gets up to leave before he has a chance to meet her. Deciding to follow his heart, he goes after her, not knowing how or even if he should introduce himself. Along the way, Sean remembers past events, and these act to influence his actions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411905</url></doc>
