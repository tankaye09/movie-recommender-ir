<plot>It's the best time of their lives. A music artist, his record label CEO and their entourage are heading home to Los Angeles from a successful show when drugs mixed with a bit of drinking and driving collide with fate. Covering up a cold-blooded murder, they try to continue life as normal. However the homeless man they left for dead, who happened to be a Vietnam Special Forces Soldier had a brother they did not know about, another Vietnam Special Forces Soldier; and he's is not happy. Months later with the crew back out for another road trip, they learn just how vengeful a murdered Veteran's battle-buddy can be as he gives them a deadly lesson on Karma: one-by-one!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632359</url></doc>
