<plot>"After the fierce fight is over, there is always a number of dead and wounded soldiers left on the fields. In this picture you can see the Sisters of Charity and members of the Red Cross Society going about the field caring for the wounded. You can also see the priest as he administers the sacrament to the dying, and you can see the dead soldiers carried from the field."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025269</url></doc>
