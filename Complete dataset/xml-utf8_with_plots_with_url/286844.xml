<plot>In the second installment of the Karaoke Revolution series, it features over 30 new songs made popular by various top artists and it now features a Medley Mode where you combine three of your favorite shortened songs in this game together as one for extra challenge. The same rules apply as to the first Karaoke Revolution where the better you sing, the better reward you earn in the end of each song.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?286844</url></doc>
