<plot>It is the spring of 1989 in Beijing. Led by students, intellectuals and labor activists in the Communist controlled People's Republic of China (PRC), throngs flooded the historic Tiananmen Square, or literally Gate of Heavenly Peace. The PRC refers to the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre as The June-Fourth Incident to distinguish it from other such protests that have happened in that same square. Tiananmen Square is a story about a man who uses his social position, intellectual clout and shrewd sense of timing to ignite a fire that ended in thousands of lives lost in a military crackdown against a peaceful protest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?607083</url></doc>
