<plot>In this retelling of the original Splatterhouse Dr West (a character never seen in the original) is now a teacher of Rick Taylor and his girlfriend Jennifer. West becomes the antagonist and sends monsters known as The Corrupted to kidnap Jennifer and fatally wound Rick. When he wakes Rick finds the famous Hell Mask and dons it. Whereas Rick became a Jason Voorhees-inspired creature in the original title, this time he becomes something of a hulking version of himself. The plot also now involves portals that spawn the creatures appearing across the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510816</url></doc>
