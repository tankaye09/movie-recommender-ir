<plot>PapaSquid productions hasn't simply arrived onto the ski and snowboard film scene - they've bombarded the industry with a movie that rivals the power of a mavericks wave, an Alaskan face, and a super-modified chain-saw. Sick rails, sick kickers, and the sickest gap jumps make this movie siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick. Going huge is the name of the game, and these playas will do it fakie, switch, inverted, cab, revert, method, boned up, tweaked out, and shirtless. This full-length P. Squiddy outing features riding by local, NH, big-mountain legends "the Pen-Fifteen Club" (Craig Belgrad, Scott Woodruf, Kristen Cote, James Pittman, Paul Cook, Curtis Barnes, Gus Gonet) as well as music by the best in NH underground (the Woodsmen, Sephouri, Ill Fitting Shoe, SlooShea). Bonus features and hilarious moments will make you ask the question "why does my spleen hurt so much when I laugh." So sit back, relax, and kick it one time for some cats who be Almost Phamous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032356</url></doc>
