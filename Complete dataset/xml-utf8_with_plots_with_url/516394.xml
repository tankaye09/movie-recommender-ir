<plot>STONED: Hemp Nation on Trial documents the story of 27 year-old Chris Clay, owner of the Hemp Nation store in London, Ontario, the first hemp store in Canada. Clay was arrested twice and his store inventory was twice confiscated by police for selling a dozen cannabis plant cuttings and seeds. Facing three life sentences for charges including trafficking in narcotics, Clay and his Toronto lawyers launch a constitutional challenge to Canada's cannabis laws. Interviews include The Honourable Allan Rock, who was the Federal Minister of Health and former Minister of Justice, The Honourable Justice John P. McCart, who was the presiding judge, several law professors and experts, and recreational and medicinal marijuana users. Clips from the 1936 classic film, "Reefer Madness" are also featured. With additional support from the Addiction Research Foundation, the Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy and the International Harm Reduction Association.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516394</url></doc>
