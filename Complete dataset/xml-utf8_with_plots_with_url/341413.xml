<plot>From wardrobe malfunctions to errant expletives on live broadcasts, the fear of offense and subsequent movement of political correctness has steadily moved into a realm of censorship. This has effectively risked one of the greatest American civil liberties: the ability to freely and openly use language. "Looking for Lenny" combines interviews with comedy legends, politicians, rising comics, actors and friends of Lenny Bruce with driving narration. This method creates an exceptional and controversial view of the state of the spoken word. The film explores the increase of self-censorship as caused by widespread, stifling political correctness. Lenny Bruce, ever the controversial comic performed stand-up routines and modernized satire as we know it today. Because of Bruce's irreverent tone and subject matter, he was arrested and charged with obscenity in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. On August 3RD, 1966 financially ruined and morally depleted from his court battles and harassment, Lenny Bruce died of a morphine overdose at the age of 39. His legacy lives on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341413</url></doc>
