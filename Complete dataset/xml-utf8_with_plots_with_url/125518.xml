<plot>Three young women cavort on a small stage, facing a stationary camera. They're dressed in frilly dresses with petticoats. For more than half the reel, they stay in line, with synchronized movements. They kick high and can hold on to the foot that's above their head and turn on the other. They somersault and land with the splits. Then they begin the dance in a circle with kicks and twirls.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125518</url></doc>
