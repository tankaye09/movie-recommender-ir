<plot>4 short films of horror are related by scantily clad hostess Pamela Sutch. 'The Madness' involves a young man who is suffering some terrible nightmares of his ex-wife, makes repeated visits to a psychiatrist, and ends up a pawn in an evil scheme. 'The Dead Forest' is about a man who attempts to bury his slaughtered newborn deep within a forest to cover his evil deed until he is tormented by the cries of his departed child and a disturbing vision. 'The Nudy Channel' revolves around a cable channel that features a temptress who speaks directly to the viewer, forcing them to commit suicide. 'Demon In The Basement' features a homemade video diary of a doctor revealing the secret monster kept in his basement that has been killing women in his home.
