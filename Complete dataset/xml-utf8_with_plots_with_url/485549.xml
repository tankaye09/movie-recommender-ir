<plot>Semeinye tainy (Family Secrets), a 24-episode mini-series, was called by its director Yelena Tsyplakova "a contemporary version of 'King Lear'." In it, a modern Russian bank president, Yermakov, learns that he is fatally ill with cancer and gathers his two sons and daughter to tell them that they must carry on his affairs, dividing responsibilities among themselves. But as soon as Yermakov hands over the reigns of his bank, a deadly struggle for control begins among the siblings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485549</url></doc>
