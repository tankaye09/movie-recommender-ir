<plot>"This picture was taken on the arrival of Admiral Cervera and the officers of the Spanish fleet at Annapolis, where they were held prisoners until the termination of the Spanish-American war. The picture shows them coming down the gang-plank, many of them severely wounded and scarcely able to walk. A very pathetic and interesting sight."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023717</url></doc>
