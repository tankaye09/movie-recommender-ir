<plot>By special permission our photographers were enabled to obtain a splendid moving panorama of the Executive Mansion taken from the private grounds in the rear. The film shows in perfect detail the beautiful flowers and shrubbery in the President's garden, the fountain and fish pond, and as the camera slowly revolves the Washington Monument in the distance comes into full view. Then the beautiful glass conservatories in the grounds, and finally the White House itself, is shown in perfect detail, making a comprehensive and interesting view of the President's home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422071</url></doc>
