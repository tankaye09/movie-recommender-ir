<plot>You know his work - we all do. Wendy's Clara Peller 'Where's the beef?', the fast talking FedEx guy, along with countless other unforgettable commercials and campaigns are part of the iconic and distinctive work of director Joe Sedelmaier. Breaking with advertising's traditional pretty, perfect mannequin people and straightforward approach to product sales, director Joe Sedelmaier's work is among some of television's best-known and most honored commercials. An early auteur in a world of salesmen, Sedelmaier created a whole genre with his idiosyncratic work featuring non-actors just trying to get through life. Point of View, profiles the man and the work that landed Joe Sedelmaier on Ad Age's list of 'Top 100 People of the Century'. The film contains many of Sedelmaier's most famous commercials as well as interviews with industry luminaries.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?437178</url></doc>
