<plot>Some three years after an "incident" in Afganistan, Corporal Apiata is informed by his commanding Officer that he is to be awarded the most prestigious military honor of them all - the Victoria Cross.For Willie, used to the deeply covert life of an SAS soldier, it is the start of a roller coaster ride into the forefront of the public eye. In Reluctant hero, we journey with Willie as he copes with the pressure of being a recognisable public figure, a proud role model for Maori, and hero to the nation.We follow Willie from the moment that he learns of the award and go behind the scenes with his family; at the NZSAS; the Victoria Cross investiture at Government House; back to his hometown marae and we relive the "incident" which earned him the coveted Victoria Cross.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586248</url></doc>
