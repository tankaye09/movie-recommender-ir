Chesbro in addition to being a cop, is also a rocker, who plays in a band on his own time, and currently has to deal with his ex-wife who is a junkie. Kelly's a medical school drop out who still hasn't told his parents. Coolidge comes from an affluent family, his grandfather was a talent agent to some of biggest names in the movies, like Chaplin. Along with Tuscon and J.C. under the leader ship of Captain Parker, they try to ptove that their (experimental) unit is viable. Currently they are working on a case involving a truck trailer that was full of money, which was found by Chesbro, and the man to whom the money belongs to, who wants it back, and doesn't care what he has to do to get it back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521794</url></doc>
