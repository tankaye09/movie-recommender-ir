<plot>Anil Vasvani is a colorless chemist who is quite contented with the three things he loves most - books, music and cooking. His only violent tendency, expressed through fantasies, is a belief that some people walking around him exist by mistake, and should be strangled and disposed of to make way for others. Living in California's Silicon Valley among newly minted dotcom millionaires, Anil's fantasy plays out in a manner even he could not have predicted, weaving his high-flying wife Uma and her cocky boy-friend Dinesh into a murderous plot that no one hatched.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?048394</url></doc>
