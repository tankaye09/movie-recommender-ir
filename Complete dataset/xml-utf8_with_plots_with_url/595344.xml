<plot>Davies' film is divided into three segments enitled "Children", "Madonna and Child", and "Death and Transfiguartion". The segments tell the life of Robert Tucker. The first segment looks at his birth and formative years in school, an austere boy's school. The bleak environment is not aided by loveless, violent homelife he experiences. Nonetheless, his father's death is a major impact to him. In the second segment, he is a closeted homosexual working in a grim office and still living at home with his daunting mother. In the final segment, he deals with his mother's death and then faces his own impending doom. As his death approaches he flashes back to his life's events.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?595344</url></doc>
