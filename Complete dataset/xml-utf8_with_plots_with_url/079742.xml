<plot>Along the 2,000 mile long border separating the United States from Mexico sit the small desert communities of Columbus, New Mexico and Palomas, Mexico. Over the last decade these otherwise sleepy towns have become a hub for illegal immigration and drug trafficking. As the United States Congress debates border security and immigration reform, these towns are quickly becoming "ground zero" for a national debate that has implications stretching far beyond the remote areas of the southwest. Profiling various agencies and residents on both sides of the border, as well as past and present migrants, this film seeks to explore the unique relationship between these towns and the people that pass through them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079742</url></doc>
