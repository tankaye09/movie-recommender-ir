<plot>Donna Erickson is a workaholic, criminal lawyer with no time for anyone but herself. Confronting her ambitious lifestyle while following her instincts about a possible murder committed over thirty years ago. On the surface, Donna's client Janice Bradford, a respectable suburban housewife, but when her past is exposed -- it's revealed that she was a member of a non-violent protest group that apparently committed a deadly bombing of a Real Estate developer. But Janice claims it was an accident, the court will have to decide. Time has caught up with Janice Bradford, and her past quickly threatens to destroy her family's future. Donna is under the gun to prove her client innocent of all charges and reinstate her as the socially aware, responsible citizen she is. With the help of her ex-husband private eye Glen Garrison, they must turn back the clock to determine if her client is a murderer, or the sole survivor of a crime linked to a lethal conspiracy. PAST SINS is a pulse-pounding mystery with an explosive final act.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425597</url></doc>
