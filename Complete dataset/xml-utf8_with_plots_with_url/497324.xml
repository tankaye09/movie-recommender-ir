<plot>Silver Palace takes the viewer on a journey into the lifestyles of the Airstreamers when over 6000 Airstream travel trailers from all over the U.S., Canada, and as far away as Australia, meet for the Thirty-Third International Wally Byam Caravan Club Rally. Silver Palace attends this event and follows the "Maple Leaf Trail Caravan" westward. To explore the culture of this group of retirees, the video combines interviews with Airstreamers, unique images of the rally activities (including an old fashion "Teen Queen Competition"), and vintage film of Wally Byam, the inventor of the Airstream Trailer and namesake of the organization that celebrates them. We travel on caravan with 40 of the silver bullet recreational vehicles (RVs) through America, visiting--among other places--Glacier National Park, Montana and Alberta, Canada. These seniors demonstrate the youth and vigor they have found in their close-knit community of travel companions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?497324</url></doc>
