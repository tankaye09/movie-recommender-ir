<plot>Two plot lines evolved for this show. The first, broadcast from August 1949 to January 1951, was a live variety show set in a nightclub with guest singers, comedians, etc. Guests who did not perform that night, or other famous people, were seen sitting at ringside in the "nightclub." The original emcee was George "the Greek Ambassador of Good Will" Givot but he left after two months, replaced by comedian Harold Barry who was succeeded by singer Bob Russell. Anne Francis appeared in floor covering commercials as "Bonny Maid" assisted by four other people. The show went off the air in January 1951 and returned in September 1951 with a different format. Lady Irish Mountbatten appeared with a group of children and the show featured children's stories and songs; the show finally went off the air in December 1951.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?638535</url></doc>
