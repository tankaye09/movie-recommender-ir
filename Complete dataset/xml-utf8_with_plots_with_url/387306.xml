<plot>No Place for You at This Workplace deals with social prejudice against certain vulnerable groups and the discrimination against them in the workplace, seen through the personal stories of the protagonists. The documentary is divided into five thematic sections, each presenting experiences of one of the groups at risk: persons with physical disabilities and sensory impairments, persons with mental health difficulties, Roma, persons living with HIV/AIDS, and persons with same-sex orientations. The viewers are introduced into each topic through opinions of accidental passers-by in the center of Zagreb.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?387306</url></doc>
