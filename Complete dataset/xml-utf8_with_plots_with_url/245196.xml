<plot>An extremely ludicrous practical joke played on Hooligan by two small boys. Hooligan is asleep when the boys fasten the skates to his feet. Hooligan jumps up and finds, to his dismay, that he has no control on his feet. The fat policeman comes in and Hooligan runs into him full tilt, knocking him over. Hooligan is, of course, arrested and carried off to jail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245196</url></doc>
