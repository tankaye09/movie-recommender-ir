<plot>"Behind the colours of the night" shows in an abstract way what happens behind the colours of the night, where people are addicted to each other, till they ascertain that everything they believed in was not that available as they even themselves had not thought to be real in all of their real illusions. A film maybe even about love. By knowing that there exists more than the colours of the night as well as the available physicalness which seems to become available by disappearing. In it's own way, by knowing to remain a secret behind the colours of the night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063670</url></doc>
