<plot>This road movie is the search of a Dutch female anthropologist to the local people in the hinterland of Papua (Indonesia) who have found - by surprise - stone figurines. They were frightened. Stone images of men were so strange to them. They thought of magical powers in action, because they themselves did not know how to carve wooden figurines, let alone stone ones. Via airplanes, canoes and trekking this documentary tries to unravel these mysteries by searching the tribal locals involved, and the wisdom of the scientists in town.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420436</url></doc>
