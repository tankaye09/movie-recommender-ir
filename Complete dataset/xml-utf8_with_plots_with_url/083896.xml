<plot>An intimate telling of one family's struggle to cope with a rare heart condition known as Long QT Syndrome. This disease is a hereditary disorder of the heart's electrical system that can cause fainting, seizures or sudden death in otherwise healthy..and often young..people. In this documentary, the director narrates the family history of the disease, specifically focusing on the death of his own father, who died suddenly at age 39. Other family members share their own stories of loss, their struggle to live with the disease and the steps they've taken to protect themselves and their loved ones. While tragic, the documentary offers hope to those afflicted by discussing advancements in medicine and informing the public of what can be done to save others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?083896</url></doc>
