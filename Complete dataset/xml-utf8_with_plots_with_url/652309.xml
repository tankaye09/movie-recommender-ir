<plot>In this pilot for a possible spin-off series based on the movie of the same name, we pick up where the movie left off, with Howard Bannister and Judy Maxwell on the plane headed back to Ames, Iowa. They are looking forward to their life together, but once they arrive at Howard's house, they are met by his fianc√©e, Claudia, a determined, if somewhat dowdy, woman, who has decided to do anything she can to hold onto Howard. Since Judy is equally determined to hang on to Howard, a battle of wills ensues, with hilarious results.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652309</url></doc>
