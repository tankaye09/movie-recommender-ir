<plot>Meet the employees of the Salty Bean Cafe; as they try to celebrate their favorite employee's last day on the job. But, he has to get out of his last day alive, tending to his fellow nutty employees and raging mad district manager that is on a mission to shut down the Salty Bean, even if it's the last thing she ever does. Our hero is Jay, who is in love with Veronica, the beautiful yet vapid sales associate from next door. Today is the day for Jay to make his move and seize the prize, but he can never seem to get it right. What happens when these crazy characters try to fix their relationships, change their lives and save the store they love from being shut down for good? A whole lot of laughs and some great coffee.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?588417</url></doc>
