<plot>Shera lives a poor lifestyle in Bombay along with his widower dad, a retired school-teacher, and is love with his neighbor, Sapna, who he hopes to marry some day. Shera wants to get rich quickly, but unable to get a job, decides to take to crime and works with a gangster, Jaggu. He soon gets arrested, tried in Court, found guilty, and sentenced to jail for several months. When he is released he returns home to find that Sapna has befriended a lawyer, Avinash Prakash. Shortly thereafter Shera's father is informed that Shera has been arrested again, this time for abducting and killing Revati Prasad, the daughter of wealthy Dharam Prasad. Sapna and Shera's dad approach Avinash for assistance, and he agrees to do so little knowing that he, Shera and Sapna are mere pawns in a deadly game that is being played by the editor and owners of the Morning News publication who are always, quite deceptively, first with crime news, and one of their future headlines is going to announce the sudden deaths of this trio!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523247</url></doc>
