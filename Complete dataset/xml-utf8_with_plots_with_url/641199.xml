<plot>This is a Romantic Comedy about Dylan Hall, a quiet man who pirates films for a living, who desperately wishes to meet someone. One day he comes up against a manager, Chad, that will do anything to make sure Dylan knows where his place is in society. He then meets 'Violet', the character from his latest job, who makes him see that life should be lived in abundance. But when Chad attempts to steal 'Violet' away from him he finally stands up for himself and for the people he cares for. In his final moments with 'Violet' he will come to realize that you can't live life through recording it, you have to be willing to let things be forgotten to truly appreciate the here and now of the moment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641199</url></doc>
