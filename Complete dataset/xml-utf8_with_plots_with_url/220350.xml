<plot>Google Baby is a journey across three continents telling the story of the up and coming baby production industry in the age of globalization. Doron, an Israeli entrepreneur with a high tech background proposes a new service - Baby production. The baby producer (as he introduces himself) provides customers with a cost effective solution using outsourcing of the surrogacy element to India as way to lower prices. The preferred genetic material is selected by the clients and the rest is left in the hands of the producer: Sperm and eggs are purchased on-line and multiple embryos are produced and frozen. Packed in liquid nitrogen only the embryos that fit the customers preferences are shipped by air to India - where they are implanted into the wombs of local surrogates. The customers arrive only at the end of the nine month pregnancy period to pick up their babies. Today, technology has turned 'making a baby' into an act independent of sex. And globalization is making it affordable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220350</url></doc>
