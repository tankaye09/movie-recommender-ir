<plot>In Flint, Michigan, on November 23, 1954, General Motors produced its 50 millionth car. This promotional film presents the big doings that day: no school, a golden Chevrolet assembled as that special car, and a parade downtown. The narration celebrates the auto industry as the driving force in the expansion of the U.S. economy for fifty years, and it weaves celebration of GM's success with patriotic fervor. We see the 50 millionth car assembled and the parade that features milestone cars, marching bands, and floats for each GM division and trademark. The crowd surges onto the street after the parade passes and the chorus sings, "You ain't seen nothing yet."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022318</url></doc>
