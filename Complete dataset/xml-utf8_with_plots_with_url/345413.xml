<plot>Shows two lovers in a hammock. Two bad boys appear. One of them climbs into a tree and scrambles out on an overhanging branch, directly over the happy pair. Just as the love-making reaches a climax, the branch breaks. The boy falls into the hammock, the hammock breaks, and the boy and the lovers are mixed up on the ground. Exceedingly ludicrous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345413</url></doc>
