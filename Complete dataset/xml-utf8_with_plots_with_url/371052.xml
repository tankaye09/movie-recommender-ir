<plot>Charts the life of Minot Davis, a quick-tongued, middle-aged writer living in Newport, RI. With only one novel published through a small-press and another self-published, the film begins with Minot's (often sardonic) opinions on current writers, and his difficulties with drinking. It then examines his spouse's indifferent opinion to his own work, and the often fractious environment his drinking has created with loved ones. We meet close friends, their opinions on him, and his sister Natasha, who explains Minot's difficult childhood. The film ends with Minot asking famed author Norman Mailer a question at a literary conference to much derision, and his own philosophies on being a writer-in-exile.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?371052</url></doc>
