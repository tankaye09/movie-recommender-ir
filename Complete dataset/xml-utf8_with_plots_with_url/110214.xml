<plot>Meet Summer a young independent woman who is free-spirited and feisty. She sifts through men like tissues. She has no interest in love, only good times. Meet Rob a young man who is a gentle soul. Who gives himself freely and completely over to the notion of love. A man who treasures the woman he is with. Meet Billy-Jean. A woman who calls it like she sees it and defies her era by doing and saying what she wants whenever she wants. On this ordinary summer day, these three people's paths will cross in unexpected ways, with the help of some coffee and pie.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110214</url></doc>
