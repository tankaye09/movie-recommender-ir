<plot>An old man staying at an old folk's home awaits a visit from his 5-year old granddaughter. A year ago, he had promised her a Hello Daniel doll for her birthday. However, when his granddaughter did not show up, the old man decides to bring the present to her. There is only one problem - he has a failing memory and he cannot remember the way home. Apart from a drawing of his old home given to him by his granddaughter, the old man is totally dependent on his own determination to go home and give the present that he had already bought to his granddaughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219524</url></doc>
