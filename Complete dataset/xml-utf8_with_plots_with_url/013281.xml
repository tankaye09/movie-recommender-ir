<plot>The amount of film that ran through cameras in the hellish shooting conditions of the Philippines over 200 shooting days in the late 1970s was gargantuan, even by action film standards. The effort to make sense of the footage was a 2 year odyssey taken on by four editors working under the direction of Francis Coppola. This documentary shows how the film was put together, taken apart and restructured in post production, with Captain Willard's [Martin Sheen] voice-over narration penned by Vietnam war era journalist Michael ["Dispatches"] Herr working together with Coppola and co-screenwriter John Milius.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013281</url></doc>
