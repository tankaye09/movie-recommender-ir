<plot>The pupils from the third class of Middle School #2 in Chongqing, the best school in central China, are being honed to fill important positions in the new global economy. The pupils are children of the new Chinese middle class. Often their parents have lived through hunger and their children must now succeed where they did not. The members of China's youngest generation have the eyes of the world pinned upon them. Will these representatives of the "I want-generation" live up to their promise? Is our fear for these smart, hard working children justified? Most of the children at school in Chongqing have been raised to be competitive, they now have to live up to the high expectations of their parents and school. In I wanna be boss... we follow a number of pupils through the final part of their third class. Their results at the end of this third school year will determine who will and who will not be part of the dreamed future. This is the time when it becomes clear how much chance the pupils stand of a (materially) successful life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253207</url></doc>
