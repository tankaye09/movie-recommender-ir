<plot>Mustache is a comedy about the violent, drunk struggle of two unemployed brothers (with mustaches) by the names of Keith and Jack Stache. Along with their female partner in crime Martha, they navigate a grimy out skirts California landscape filled with pot holes at every turn, mostly caused by their arch rivals the Tattoo brothers. In contrast, Donna Topolous, a love interest of the 'ladies man' of the two brothers Keith Stache lives a life of wealth and privilege. She is trapped in her cage as well though, surrounded by the ever increasing shenanigans of her suitors Jonathan Punswell and Alfred Fanciful and the non-stop bad advice of her closest and untrustworthy friend Diana. Mustache is one day in this odd collection of characters lives, culminating in the pain, redemption and at least temporary sobriety that always comes with the next morning. Featuring a large cast including Lee Ladouceur of up and coming rock band The Little Ones as well as many talented performers in the art of improv comedy, Mustache is an experience you'll soon never forget!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382678</url></doc>
