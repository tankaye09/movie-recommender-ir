<plot>There's no time for childhood. Time is money, and Jack needs to realize that - at least that's what his father thinks. Jack's father is desperate to wake up his son and will do anything he can achieve that goal. Does Jack ever wake up? And why is it so important for him to wake up, anyway? This story is based on actual events my father used to do to me every morning. The father first tries a gentle approach, which fails. Then he moves on to drenching Jack with not one but two buckets of water and that still doesn't work, which leaves the father with one more choice. Does Jack ever wake up? And why is it so important for him to wake up anyways?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220101</url></doc>
