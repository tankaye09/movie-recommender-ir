<plot>This biographical short film was shown at the 2004 Democratic National Convention as an introduction to the presidential candidate, John Kerry. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film includes never-before-seen 8mm childhood home movies and exclusive footage of Kerry's campaign tour. The film features interviews with family and friends who talk about the courage John Kerry has shown as a soldier and a veteran, the fights he has waged for middle-class values, and the faith in family he has exhibited as a father and husband.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015292</url></doc>
