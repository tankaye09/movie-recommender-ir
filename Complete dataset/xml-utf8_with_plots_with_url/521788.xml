<plot>Sunset is a film about three, life long best friends,Layne, Van, and Brian. They are suddenly faced with a life or death moral dilemma between them. After learning to love all three characters for their own idiosyncrasies, Brian receives the fatal news that he has contracted AIDS. This news, while obviously overwhelming, alarmingly opens a Pandora's box of possible unfortunate scenarios. Brian has made a decision to avoid the trials and tribulations of AIDS. So through brotherhood asks his friends,"Would they end his life?". Sunset captures the morally gripping emotions of Mystic River without losing the dry and brilliant humor of Beautiful Mind. It also expresses the dysfunctional brotherhood love of GoodWill Hunting combined with the spiritual hope and melancholic purification of Shawshank Redemption.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521788</url></doc>
