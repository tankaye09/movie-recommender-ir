<plot>When ladies man, Michael Corso, leaves the east coast for Hollywood, ostensibly to pursue his dream of acting, he encounters unexpected dating problems. Despite being urged by Maria, his roommate, to concentrate on his career, Mikey finds he cannot focus until he scores in the dating game first; a game where the rules have changed and the women come with a whole new set of complications. After a series of mind boggling dates, Mikey is forced to face up to whether he is up to the challenge of trying to woo the ladies of Los Angeles ;or whether he will merely become another casualty of their eccentric needs. It's All A Game is a side-splitting comedy that exposes the truth about dating in Hollywood.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270163</url></doc>
