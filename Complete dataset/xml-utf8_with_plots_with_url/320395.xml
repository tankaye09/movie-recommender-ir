<plot>Last Chance for Romance is a half-hour documentary series about couples in crisis. Each episode features a couple at a relationship crossroads - some have only recently arrived, while others have been stuck there for years. Each couple is flown to a beautiful Caribbean resort for five days of therapy and relaxation. Free from the busy demands of everyday life, and immersed in a lush tropical paradise, couples are able to focus on how to improve their relationship. With its therapeutic mix of a tropical location, counseling, and activity, Last Chance for Romance offers viewers a fresh perspective on how to make relationships better.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320395</url></doc>
