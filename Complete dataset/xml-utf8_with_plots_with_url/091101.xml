<plot>The year is 1999. Cole is a superficial guy who is soaking up his last few days of summer. His best friend Seth has recently returned from being away for a month, and Cole has just dyed his hair. Cole has what he feels should make him happy, but he isn't. Trey, the local music hero, suggests that Cole start up a band with Seth. Cole takes the idea to heart, and forms a band with Seth, and Seth's pothead neighbor Fletch. All they need is a bassist. Seth's friend Audrey suggests that her stepsister, Geri, join the band. Geri agrees and the band is complete. But an accident forces Fletch out of the band. Although the band fades away, Cole finds a friend in Geri. They both have things they are unhappy with and find solace in discussing them together. But problems with Seth, among other things, send Cole's sense of identity out the window. But can he find himself before the world ends January 1, 2000?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091101</url></doc>
