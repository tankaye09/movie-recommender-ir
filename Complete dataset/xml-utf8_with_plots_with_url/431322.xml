<plot>Phoenix Blue is one of the most successful recording artists in world music. But no one knows who he is... He has never performed live. Never appeared on film or TV. Never spoken to the press. No photo has ever been printed of him yet his records continue to sell in their millions. So why is he hiding and where? Rachel Delaney, a young London journalist, is determined to find out and she is not one to give up. A fragile lead draws her into the world of Internet cyber-hacking and the dangerous sport of freediving. In her pursuit of the ultimate story she loses almost everything but her belief pays off when she reaches the Caribbean and discovers a complex young man, Rick Earnhardt, living on a super yacht under the control of a ruthless woman Persha Lovich (Amanda Donohoe). Events spiral dangerously out of control as Rachel slowly unravels the dark secret behind Phoenix Blue...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431322</url></doc>
