<plot>In April 1968, five buildings on the Columbia University campus were occupied by students angry with the administration's policies. The event became a decisive moment for the New Left in America and the anti-war movement in general. This documentary re-evaluates this brief moment in America's history and moves beyond the romantic accounts of that era by penetrating deep into the real, nuanced politics of the time. Extensive interviews with many of Columbia's African-American students who were involved hold much meaning because their important story is told for the first time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017259</url></doc>
