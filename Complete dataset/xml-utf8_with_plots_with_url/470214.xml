<plot>The Final Chapter traces the events that would eventually lead to the fall of Hitler's Third Reich and the destruction of a once great nation. The episode begins with the allied invasion of Europe and ends with a tour of the only remaining intact section of the Berlin Chancellery bunker. Highlights include an in-depth tour of the historic D-Day landing sites at Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword beaches including the solemn monuments and memorials. The tour continues with stops at Rommel's headquarters at La Roche Guyon, Hitler's headquarters, Wolfsschluct II and Wolfsschanze. Other stops include Gestapo headquarters, the people's court and execution chamber at Plotzensee Prison. Viewers will also visit sites made famous during the Battle of the Bulge, including the remains of the Remagen bridge. In addition to the remaining Nazi buildings of the Third Reich viewers will be taken on a fascinating tour of one of Hitler's Teutonic castles of order, Ordenburg Vogelsang.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470214</url></doc>
