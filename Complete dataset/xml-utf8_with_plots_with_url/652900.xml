<plot>It's the Weavers vs. the Mathews in Hickory Holler. The Weavers are singing (the title song), the Mathews are sleeping. They wake up and start shooting, which ends the song. A Weaver coonskin cap is shot off, and proves not to be quite dead yet. The sheriff drives up in a very broken-down car and nails up a notice: The feud is to be settled by a rooster fight at Higgins' Barn. The fight is on: The roosters circle each other (getting their necks tangled). They proceed to mix it up, to the William Tell Overture (the storm). The Mathews rooster gets a shot of moonshine, and is soon bashing his opponent. They crash into each other and knock each other out; the sheriff tries declaring either a winner, or a draw, but that only gets the people more riled up; everyone piles into the ring as the roosters watch.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652900</url></doc>
