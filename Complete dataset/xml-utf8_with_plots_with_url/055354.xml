<plot>Back to the Front takes place on the Eastern front during 1944. Fulbright and Clarke are two American POWs who have jumped a prisoner transport and are trying to make it to the Russian front. On the way, they happen upon a downed black pilot, who tells them he can lead them there. The white POWs are torn between then desire to return home, and their distrust of this outsider. Back to the Front depicts three men far removed from American society, but still acting under its rules and conventions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055354</url></doc>
