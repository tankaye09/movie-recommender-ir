<plot>One day. One failed life. Jay's life of hustling on the streets finally catches up with him and a moment of truth awaits him at the toll of midnight. He spends the day trying to tie up the loose ends of his life, visiting the people who have made an impact on him, one by one, until his time is up and his crossroad stares him in the eye. He must say good-bye to the man who taught him everything he knows, the woman who used to love him, the family who felt helpless watching him choose a life of crime, and the daughter he never really knew. He has to look over his shoulder at every move as he plots to make some quick cash, pulls the trigger to survive, weasels his way out of a jam with two cops and relives the past events that landed him here. All this with a ticking clock that will settle a score with a ruthless gangster. Can he make the right decision and find redemption, making his selfish life worth something in the end by helping those he cares about? Can one day make a difference in a man's life, or is it too late? One day. One failed life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670195</url></doc>
