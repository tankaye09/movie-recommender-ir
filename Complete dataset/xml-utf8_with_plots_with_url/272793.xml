<plot>Fond of eating, Gauri lives a wealthy lifestyle along with 7 brothers and their respective wives. The entire family pamper and let her have her way. When she informs them that she wants to wed Shankar from Sitapur, they make all arrangements and Gauri re-locates to live with Shankar, and his family, which consists of a younger sister, Chutki; mom, Janki; and dad Sukhiram. When the time comes for Gauri to perform Karwa Chauth, she re-locates to her family home and offers prayers to appease Devi Maa Karwa Chauth (the daughter of Bhagwan Shri Ganesh) and not eat anything until she sees the Moon. Her brothers feel sorry for her plight, arrange for a fake moon so that she could eat something. This angers Devi Maa, and as a result Shankar passes away. Blaming herself and in a semi-senile state, Gauri refuses to permit the family to cremate Shankar, insisting on staying with his decomposing body until Devi Maa forgives her and brings Shankar back to life. Little does Gauri know that Devi Maa has inflicted widowhood on her as a punishment, and is not testing her fortitude. With community pressure building up to cremate Shankar, how long will Gauri continue to hold on to Shankar's lifeless body?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272793</url></doc>
