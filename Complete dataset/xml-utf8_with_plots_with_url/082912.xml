<plot>A marathon bridge tournament, which started three months ago, is being held at the home of Mrs. Smith, one of the competitors. As it finally nears its completion, Mr. Smith is becoming increasingly desperate and agitated over the situation. When the score ends in a tie, the tournament is extended for three more months. Mr. Smith is beside himself with rage - he ejects everyone from his home, and refuses to let his wife play any further. Later on, even when she tries to turn on the radio to listen to the broadcast of the game, Mr. Smith is thrown into a frenzy, and he starts to take out his accumulated frustration on the radio.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082912</url></doc>
