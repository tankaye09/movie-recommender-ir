<plot>A man is seen sprinkling the garden when a bad boy happens along and treads on the hose. The gardener looks into the nozzle, bad boy lets go and the water bursts out with such force as to almost throw him down. In discovering the one who caused the trouble, he chases and catches him and proceeds to give him a bath. Very funny, and somewhat exciting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210188</url></doc>
