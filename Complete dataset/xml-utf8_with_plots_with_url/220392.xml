<plot>In this modern take on Anton Chekhov's classic short story "Gooseberries", Ivan Ivanovitch and Burkin join their friend, Alehin, for an evening of tea and conversation. From the start, Ivan begins to let his inhibitions go and enjoy life. As the evening wears on, Ivan tells a story about his brother Nikolay; a story about ambition, dedication, and sacrifice for happiness. His brother achieves his dreams, but upon Ivan's arrival to visit his brother, Nikolay's country home is nothing like he had dreamed of, but he was happy with what he had. During Ivan's stay with his brother, he comes to realize that he, too, is happy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220392</url></doc>
