<plot>"At an outlay of considerable money we have produced the finest collection of war vessels in life motion pictures that has ever been placed before the public. These warships are especially interesting owing to the good work performed by them in the late Spanish-American war. This picture presents our own torpedo boat, the Winslow, a comparatively small vessel, but capable of great work in her line that of firing torpedoes under the water from a great distance, and disabling the largest battleships."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?613573</url></doc>
