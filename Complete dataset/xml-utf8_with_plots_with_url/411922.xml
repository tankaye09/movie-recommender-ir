<plot>'One Balloon' begins with a girl imprisoned at the 'Institute of Knowledge'. There people stare at information cards until the information on them disappears. Her imprisonment ends when her biological clock instigates a physical split in herself, forcing a confrontaion between two aspects of the woman: intellect and sexuality. One woman wants to fulfill the woman's biological need to reproduce, while the other wants to continue at the institute. In a struggle, one woman is placed in a box, which then shrinks and is eaten by the victorious woman. The woman embarks on the ritual of dating, where couples meet each other to exchange suitcases filled with personal objects. Couples look through the suitcases hoping to find objects that match. When a match is made, the couple signs a contract and consumes a pair of rings like breath-mints. During a moment of intimacy, the headless woman castrates the man by cutting his hair. A pair of scissors with the legs of a woman hypnotizes the unsuspecting man with her sexuality, and performs an unsusal hair cut. When the man awakes like Samson, to find his long hair gone, he is a changed man. Watch to see what happens next in this abstract world of the mind, and why this film is titled 'One Balloon.'</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411922</url></doc>
