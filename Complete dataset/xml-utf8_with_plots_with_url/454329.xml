<plot>Raja lives a poor lifestyle in a small village along with his mother, Shanta, sister, Sajju, and an alcoholic and gambler dad, Hariram, who abuses him physically and verbally as well as forces him to beg. Sajju sells toys (Firkis) for a living, but Hariram forces her to give him all the money. Shanta and Sajju encourage Raja to attend the local school, but Hariram tears up his schoolbooks and won't permit him to study. Raja likes to play with his friends and pretend to be the king. When Hariram witnesses this, he beats him up. Shortly thereafter Shanta and Sajju find out that Raja has lost his mind and really believes he is a king, and refuses to listen nor obey his elders anymore.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454329</url></doc>
