<plot>Sao Paulo, 2003. Fifteen afro-descendant women talk about their lives. They have different occupations: they're hairdressers, clerks, maids, manicures, students. They work hard to make a living and help support their families. However, they lead a parallel life: they are queens inside the carnival community and they incorporate gods during the Candomble celebrations. Many times portrayed at the media as mere sex symbol - the "mulata" - these women are proud of their African roots and their femininity and celebrate them through the practice of Carnival and Candomble rituals, singing and dancing. They've unveiled a way of nurturing fantasy within reality, filling their routine with creativity and optimism. "Fala, Mulher!" tries to capture the essence of this group of women who turn their survival into art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188080</url></doc>
