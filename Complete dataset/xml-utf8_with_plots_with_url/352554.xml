<plot>Alex, a 33 year-old bike-messenger from New York, can't wait to see his long-lost friend Doug who is getting married in Hawaii. Jackson, a 32 year-old alcoholic from Reno, quits his job to go to Doug's wedding and find a better life. After Doug fails to meet Alex at the airport, Alex is forced to catch a ride with Jackson, who cares more about going to the beach than going to Doug's wedding. When they can't locate Doug at his house, Jackson takes the reigns and leads the two on a quest to find the ultimate tropical Hawaiian beach. At the rocky desolate beach they find, Jackson's disappointment turns to anger. He opens his wedding gift for Doug - a custom surfboard - and breaks it in half, plunging the two into mutual despair. When they finally get to the wedding, Doug barely remembers them, and they are left with nothing but each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352554</url></doc>
