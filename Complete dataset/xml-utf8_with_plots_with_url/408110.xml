<plot>Danny Hope is an undergraduate performing arts major who has lost his girlfriend, love for the theater and failed a required course which, if his father catches wind of, will have to drop out of school and enlist into the Army's Fort Killemall. He quickly enrolls in summer school and tells his parents he got a great job in a theater for the summer. Paying for summer school alone, Danny finds himself living in a condemned theater on campus, which has been occupied by a crazy performing arts major since the 1970's. As their relationship grows, both begin to look at life with a renewed energy until Danny finds out that his school, the University of Our Lady of Great Depression will close within a matter of weeks. With the help of his zany summer school friends, Danny is faced with life's most perplexing question, follow his heart and face the consequences or escape and save his ass?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408110</url></doc>
