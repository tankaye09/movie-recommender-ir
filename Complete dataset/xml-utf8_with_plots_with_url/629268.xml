<plot>Under Fire tells the stories of four Israeli families - two Arab and two Jewish - whose loved ones were killed during the Second Lebanon War in the Summer of 2006: a mother and her two daughters chatting in their yard; a young father working at the train depot; another father running to get his little girl a blanket; a lifeguard trying to save his mother and sister. Surviving family members share their eyewitness accounts, as well as their pleas for future peace. Their stories are told against the backdrop of authentic footage from the war, showing the devastation inflicted upon the Israeli civilian population.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629268</url></doc>
