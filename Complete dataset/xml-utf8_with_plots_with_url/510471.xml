<plot>This very amusing picture opens by showing a mischievous boy knocking on the door of a house. After knocking he runs away and when the lady of the house opens the door there is no one to be seen. When the door is closed the urchin returns, hammers on it as before, again running off. This time the door is opened by a desperate looking man, who is evidently suffering from a severe case of neuralgia, judging from the way his head is bandaged. He is armed with a large stick, with which he intends to punish the culprit, but as he cannot find him, he returns to the house to wait for him to come back. A milkman now appears upon the scene with a large can of milk, and setting it down by his side, knocks on the door. The door is quickly opened and the invalid rushes out upon the milkman, upsetting him and the milk, and making a laughable finish as the pair flounder around on the sidewalk in the milk.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510471</url></doc>
