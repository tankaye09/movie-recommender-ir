<plot>A casually dressed man, the Silencer, sits at a quiet bus stop at night in the rain - waiting. A businessman, soon arrives to wait for the bus as well. The business man engages the Silencer in boring conversation. The conversation is a bit one sided as the Silencer says nothing and anxiously waits for something. Finally, he receives a text message and he waits no longer - he quickly slits the man's throat and calmly watches the man die as the rain pours down. After the business man dies, the Silencer notices that the business man was wearing some nice shoes. He steals the man's shoes and walks away into the rainy night. The dead man lies at the bus stop in plain sight, but the cars just keep driving by.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396032</url></doc>
