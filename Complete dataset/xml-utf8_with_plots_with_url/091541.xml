<plot>A dry, gently mocking look at the world of student filmmaking and personal documentaries in general, Camera Noise is the tragicomic story of film student Kyle Gilman who decides to record his own life on film. Unaware that his life is incredibly dull, he shows a two-hour rough cut to his professors, personal documentary filmmakers Ross McElwee and Robb Moss. After they suggest shooting something interesting for a change, Kyle decides to film his girlfriend Jennie breaking up with him on camera. What could be more dramatic and interesting?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091541</url></doc>
