<plot>Sam Preston finally has it all... He just received a promotion to vice president in a prestigious company and his girlfriend of six months, Sara Michaels, is the best thing to come into his life... ever. But there is something else, Sam has a secret. A secret he hides from everyone around him, including his best friend Jerry Marsh. Sam has been withdrawn, unwilling to venture out of his new home to enjoy the company of his friends. They wonder why Sam has changed from a social happy bachelor to a quiet recluse. When Sam finally relents and agrees to join his co-workers in a congratulatory drink at the local bar, they see a glimmer of hope for the old Sam... or at least they think they do. When Sam accidentally leaves his cell phone behind, Jerry sees an opportunity to return it and pay a visit to Sam and Sara. When he arrives, he finds more than he bargains for and it may cost someone their life. Who will pay for discovering Sam's obsession?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?406643</url></doc>
