<plot>Twice different. Five immigrants in Germany tell there stories. Do they feel different because they are from another country? Do they feel different, because they are lesbian or gay? Are they discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or because of their skin color? Or are theses issues not nearly as dire and drastic as others might think? In the end each story gives a different answer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156463</url></doc>
