<plot>Photos of cosmopolitan cityscapes are systematically scanned and display views of office blocks, flats, dark corners, illuminated windows and skyscrapers. On a soundtrack you hear a woman's voice recounting her story and that of the world; about images of today, about a journey. Her monologue is a fictionalized version of the impressions that Asselbergh's picked up during his trip to Palestine. He deliberately chose the film to show the explosive and mediatized situation in the region by taking an absolutely minimalist audiovisual approach. The fact that he creates a detached view by using a female voice instead of his own, coupled with deviating from a run-of-the-mill documentary style, produces a complex approach to his ideas and feelings on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019685</url></doc>
