<plot>They text faster than most people can type. They customize their mobiles the way their mothers customize their gardens. And when they go to sleep at night, their phones are tucked safely under their pillows. Becky, Brittany and Laura are barely in their teens but already mobile phones are as natural a part of their life as they are necessary. Each day millions of girls just like them freely flirt, gossip, hate and share their most personal fears over SMS, even though they may lack the courage to make an actual phone call. Set amidst teen talent factories and the blissfully quiet streets of Sydney's Western Suburbs, Lost Without You explores this social phenomenon and asks whether mobile phones are connecting girls to the real world or removing them from it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343717</url></doc>
