<plot>College life: playing street fighter, eating pizza, discovering yourself in music - it would be nice if Trevor and Kurt could appreciate these things, but they have been completely swept up in a contest that could land them a job DJing at a real radio station! Leave it up to the treacherous girlfriend Steph, some gossiping classmates, and the generally inept radio students to make their journey that much more difficult. College Radio Sucks is not your typical college film. Gone are the drugs, sorority girls, partying, and slacking off - replaced with radio shows, underground music, and constant self-promotion. Wait - no drugs, sorority girls, or parties? It's no wonder college radio sucks!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110780</url></doc>
