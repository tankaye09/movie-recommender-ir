<plot>Kedarnath is employed with a local clock/watch repair shop, owned by a parsimonious Adarshan Lala. Kedarnath goes out of his way to help a destitute woman, Maya, who husband is missing, with two daughters, Veena and Vidya. Kedarnath rents a room with them, writes letters to her on behalf of her husband, Pannalal, and even arranges the marriage of Veena with the son of Daulatram. When Maya tells him that she has no money to pay for the marriage expenses, he steals cash from his employer, and tells Maya that the money is from Pannalal. And all along telling Maya that he is a close friend of Pannalal, even though he has never met Pannalal, leave alone know him, making one think as to what devious secret Kedarnath is hiding, and what is the reason behind Pannalal's disappearance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426753</url></doc>
