<plot>Paano ba ang Mangarap? revolves around the love between Lissa and Benny. Despite belonging to different social classes, they think they have found the perfect love in each other. But their love was not meant to be. When Lissa becomes pregnant, she and Benny plan to marry, without regard for Francia, Benny's mother who is against their union. But before they could tie the knot, an accident takes Benny's life. Benny leaves the world with only a promise from his brother, Eric - that the latter will find Lissa and give her a good future. How will Eric find Lissa? What happens when he falls in love with the her? And what will Francia do to ensure that Lissa never gets to be with Benny - even in spirit?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419749</url></doc>
