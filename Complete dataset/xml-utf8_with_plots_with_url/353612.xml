<plot>"A group of seven children gathered about a tub of soap suds, pushing and jostling for preference. This is an exterior scene, full of animation and free from artificiality. The figures are clearly defined, well in the foreground, and the group well composed. The familiar scene of children blowing soap bubbles from clay pipes is here shown under natural conditions."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353612</url></doc>
