<plot>Initially created as a summer news program, this show gave viewers an in-depth look at issues that were facing America and the world. Using a combination of rebroadcast news programs and specially produced documentaries, reports were typically given by veteran news anchors, but also occasionally by well-known actors. The program went off the air after its first summer, but returned in 1965 and lasted for another three years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022966</url></doc>
