<plot>After leaving his family, Will Knight runs to the big city in search of his place in life. Upon meeting the outgoing Jay, Will believes he's found the only family he'll ever need. However, after getting mixed up in crime and murder, Will realizes this world never deals a fair hand. Meanwhile in suburban life, Carl Franklin deals with the tragic loss of his mother and his brother's coma.
