<plot>When I was a student, I was assigned to shoot a roll of film as an exercise. This is the result of that roll of film which was combined with some video shot on a Panasonic DVX. That being said, there really isn't much plot going on since this was merely an experiment in cinematography as a student.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370736</url></doc>
