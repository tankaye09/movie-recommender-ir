<plot>"There is hardly a lovelier spot along the whole Lehigh Valley Railroad than this stretch of road. We are on a gentle curving bit of track, mountains on both sides. We glide beneath a slender bridge, pass a crossing and a wayside station, and run out on a steep embankment. Suddenly the road dips into the hills, then out again, round a point, and then valley of the Susquehanna bursts upon our view. Far away in the blue distance the river glistens like a silver thread. There are bridges and houses and barns and steeples. There are checker-board farms, and broad patches of virgin forest, all calm and serene in the glory of God's sunshine."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421956</url></doc>
