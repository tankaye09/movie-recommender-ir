<plot>By 10 years old Frankie 13 had it all. He was the youngest child to ever read and write in the state of Pennsylvania. He received awards for poems and speeches that he wrote starting at the age of 6. But life hasn't turned out like he expected. Now 26, he still lives with his mother and is following his father's career path. His true love, though, is Rock Paper Scissors. And his dedication to the game may be the one thing he needs to be a success again, the World Rock Paper Scissors Champion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202490</url></doc>
