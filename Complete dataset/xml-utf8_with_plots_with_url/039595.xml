<plot>Andrew P. Panda (Andy's pop) asks the local roofing company if they will repair his shoddy roof. He is quickly turned off by the exorbitant price and determines, "I'll fix it myself!" Naturally, Pop isn't the most skilled of workers but does his best anyway. Unfortunately, his best turns to his worst when an annoying pelican distracts him by making the roof his new home. Pop angrily tries to rid himself of the feathered pest (who just wants to mind his own business) and destroys the roof more than ever in the process. Admitting defeat, he again calls the roofing company only to be irately told, "FIX IT YOURSELF!!!" Interestingly, Andy Panda does not appear in this cartoon at all... it's a rare solo cartoon for his dad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039595</url></doc>
