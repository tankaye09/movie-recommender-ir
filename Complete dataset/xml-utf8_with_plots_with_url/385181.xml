<plot>Ben, a wannabe filmmaker marooned outside the Cannes Film Festival's charmed circle of power and influence, pretends to be a yacht-owning big producer to impress hopeful actress Laura, the woman of his dreams. She responds to the idealistic romantic she sees in him, but is less enamoured of his attempts to play the big shot. By the time he finally gets her on "his" yacht he might just be winning her round, but then he's exposed as a fake, and she disappears. But, having taken the scam so far, he discovers that there's no difference between faking it and being it, and he duly becomes the toast of the town. Now he tries to get her back, but then finds she has her secret too. The story is narrated by Ben's incorrigible sidekick Jason, who, with unintentional hilarity, is blind to the magic of romance that Ben's deception has unwittingly conjured up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385181</url></doc>
