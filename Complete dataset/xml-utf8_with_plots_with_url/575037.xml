<plot>Richard White's dream is to stage opera in the living room of his Norfolk home. Mira Erdevicki's film captures White's determination, village politics and the reaction of his neighbours surrounding the staging of Mozart's "Il Seraglio" in a 1960's staging with his cast of local amateurs. In essence the film highlights the foibles of British middle-class culture and some amusing moments through the eyes of the Yugoslav born Director.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575037</url></doc>
