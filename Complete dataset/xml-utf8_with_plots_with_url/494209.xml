<plot>Flags of nations fly above the water chutes at Coney Island's amusement park. A small boat with four or five seated passengers and a pilot standing in back slides down the chute. On the far side of the chute, we can see a boat going up for its next ride down, empty except for the standing pilot. A large wagon full of people going up for the boat ride is also visible, as is an empty wagon heading down to pick up the next group of riders. The boat going up and the transport wagons look as if they are being pulled on cables beneath them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494209</url></doc>
