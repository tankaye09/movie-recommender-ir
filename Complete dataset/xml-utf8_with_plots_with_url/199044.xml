<plot>Taken at a stag-hunt. Shows the hounds rushing through the hedge, with the huntsmen following. Each horse comes on with a rush and clears the hedge with the exception of one. This one goes to his knees, throwing the rider heavily to the ground. Fortunately, neither horse nor rider is hurt. A fine picture of one of the greatest of sports.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199044</url></doc>
