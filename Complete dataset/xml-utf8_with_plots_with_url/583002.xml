<plot>How would you feel discovering to live the life you don't think you're living? And what would you think if you find out to be the person you have never knew to be? The supernatural/psychological film The Playmaker is about the real within the unreal: how a man's mind between will, frustration, power &amp; weakness gets to the unimaginable . . . In the middle of nowhere a desperate man gets somehow in front of an appearing abandoned country-seat after a long distance race against time. Once inside, between strange noises and shocking situations he finds out an unbelievable truth. Reality, imagination or parallel lives? What if you have the gift to live them simultaneously? There's only one question left. What if you know the answer?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583002</url></doc>
