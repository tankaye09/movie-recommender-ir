<plot>This is a story about a young girl's quest to meet her Hero Jean-Michel Cousteau. She journeys from her home on a farm in Ontario Canada to Catalina Island where she snorkels in the ocean for the very first time. Slater discovers important messages that she wants to share with the world at Jean-Michel's environmental camp at Howland's Landing. Come along and discover with Slater the hidden world of the kelp bed ecosystem and see how we are all linked to the ocean. Hear about what Jean-Michel's Hero taught him about the unwritten constitution of tomorrow. This is an informative documentary that makes the science of ecology fun. Jean-Michel Cousteau inspires each of us to make a difference with our own life by living in a more sustainable way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?501025</url></doc>
