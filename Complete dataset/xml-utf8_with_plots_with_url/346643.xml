<plot>LUCKY LAKE is a short documentary about a racially mixed vacation community that was robbed of its lake. Nestled in the Catskill Mountains about 2 hours from New York City, Luxton Lake (aka "Lucky Lake") has a vibrant, seductive past full of jazz music, lakeside dances, and Harlem families saving to build their own cottage in the mountains. But in 1982, Luxton Lake's residents watched in horror as their lake was drained. Bigoted town officials were blamed, and racial tensions escalated. Homeowners hired a prominent civil rights attorney to sue the town for racial discrimination. The town's defense: the old dam was a hazard and had to go. Today's decrepit clapboard cabins and rotting rowboats are the only reminder of the lake's rich history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346643</url></doc>
