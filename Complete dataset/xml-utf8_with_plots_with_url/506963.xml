<plot>Hosted by music journalist and recording artist Dimitri Ehrlich, this series showcases music videos, short films, short documentaries and other works that illustrate the symbiotic relationship between music and film. The series also offers viewers a chance to meet the musicians, filmmakers and other independent artists involved in the creation of musical images. Each episode begins with a look at two or more music videos that are linked together by a common denominator followed by a segment in which a filmmaker introduces a rarely seen piece that has inspired, influenced or otherwise affected him or her. Another segment called 'Meet' profiles various artists who bridge the worlds of music and film, an ever-expanding community that can include a band that is scoring a film; a filmmaker who uses music to add layers of meaning to a scene; or a music supervisor who can name, say, every garage rock band that ever saw the inside of a recording studio. Finally, in a segment titled 'I Made It Myself', musicians discuss what happens when they put down their instruments and go behind the camera to make their own short films, videos, EPK's and other works; the musician then presents one of his or her filmed pieces.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?506963</url></doc>
