<plot>Will a "super quake" push Southern California into the Pacific? How was this 16th century mystic able to "see" a time when "people will travel safely by air, land and sea?" Some say Nostradamus was a man who heard from God. Others say his knowledge was from the occult. This video hosted by Ray Comfort reveals that there was an other means by which he obtained such incredible prophecies. Was the body of Nostradamus really exhumed some 200 years after his death and wine drunk from his skull? What will happen in the 25th Century? You will be amazed at the answers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?589638</url></doc>
