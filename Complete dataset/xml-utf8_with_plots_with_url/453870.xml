<plot>Mira (Neha) comes from a very wealthy family, however, she wants to get married to Akash Sharma (Jatin Grewal), who is not so wealthy. Against the wishes of her mother and brother, Mira gets married to Akash. The bad memories are left behind when Mira's family finally "forgives" them, at the birth of baby-boy, Rahul (Yash Pathak). With the family with such a acrimonious past, coming together, their marriage deteriorates, to such an extent that they have to involve the police and the courts for purposes of custody. The only obstacle coming between the couple from getting married again to different people are marred by Rahul, who is unable to accept his parents' divorce.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?453870</url></doc>
