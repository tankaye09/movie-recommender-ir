<plot>James Crane wakes to find himself in what appears to be an insane asylum. Who is he and what is he doing here? With no memory of his past, he searches for clues to his existence. At every turn he is met with resistance, his questions falling on deaf ears. As the days go by with maddening repetitiveness, his nights begin to haunt him with disturbing dreams. Images flash in his mind. Hands tied with rope. Money in a case. Blood on his hands. In these dreams, a woman tied to a chair cries out to him for help- the last image his mind captures before a trigger is pulled. Are these merely dreams or the last memories from his life fighting their way back into his mind?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102065</url></doc>
