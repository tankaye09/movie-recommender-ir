<plot>30 years since his first European Cup success, 15 years since his retirement and 5 years after his death; Brian Clough continues to fascinate. The Afterlife of Brian continues a pace; best-selling book after best-selling book, a statue is unveiled in Nottingham city centre, and a feature film is released. "Clough" has intimate access with the family as Brian is forever remembered in bronze and exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of Nigel as he becomes the new manager of Derby County, on the night the wheel comes full circle and he takes over at the club his father walked out on 35 years ago.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109124</url></doc>
