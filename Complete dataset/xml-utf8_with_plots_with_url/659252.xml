<plot>Two would be criminals, Grogan and Redic have decided to rob the local small town bank. There's just one problem; the entire townsfolk and police department have become aware of their little scheme, yet completely unwittingly known to both Grogan and Redic. The town has asked police Chief Earl Moore and Deputy James Cillo to step in and do something about the situation.
