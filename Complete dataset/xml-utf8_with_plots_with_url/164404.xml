<plot>Tobey, a mechanic, uses desperate measures to replace the void in his life left by his dead wife. When his inflatable doll ruptures, he is convinced that a woman he has been secretly watching is destined to be his new companion. But when her resistance pushes him to a murderous rage, preserving this new "organic" doll proves more difficult than it first appears. Weaving in and out of this storyline is April, a mysterious fortune teller with a secret of her own. Earthly Things is about the events that ultimately bring Tobey and April together, and a tale of the destructive and consuming nature of obsession.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164404</url></doc>
