<plot>A man and his wife are repairing the wall-paper. The man is standing on a board running from the back of the chair to a barrel. As he makes a misstep, the board tips up. He slides into the barrel and the pail of paste flies in the air. The unfortunate man is completely covered by its contents. The picture is well worked out and has a very effective climax.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014111</url></doc>
