<plot>Daphne or The Forbidden Touch is a short, poetic narrative that revisits the Greek myth of Daphne to tell the story of a woman's recovery from a psychotic episode. The film is concerned with presenting a more imaginative approach to the current treatment and understanding of mental illness in our culture. The non-linear narrative interweaves three periods in the life of Daphne. As a child, she is chased through the forest, and severely punished by her father for playing by the stream despite his strict prohibition. Later, during a psychotic break, she refuses her doctor's prescriptions, preferring to find her own path towards recovery. Finally, as a writer, she mines her own past toward ends both artistic and therapeutic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126843</url></doc>
