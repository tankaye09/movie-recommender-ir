<plot>After several guest hosting appearances on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, Dave was given his own morning talk-show. This show included a full orchestra, news breaks, and a cast of regulars. Although not long-run, it introduced Dave to the general public on a wide scale and in a way was the test run for his wildly popular Late Night with David Letterman, which ran on NBC for years, later followed by The Late Show with David Letterman on CBS.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?552049</url></doc>
