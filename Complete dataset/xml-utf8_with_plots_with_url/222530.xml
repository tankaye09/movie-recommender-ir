<plot>Firefighter/Paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto are each promoted to the rank of Captain in the Los Angeles County Fire Department. After the ceremony, whereupon the reality that they'll no longer be partners hits them, they reminisce about their six years of working together on Squad 51. In flashbacks, they remember some of the most memorable rescues and milestones in their paramedic careers. Afterwards, they vow to remain close friends even if they aren't going to be working in the same station any longer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222530</url></doc>
