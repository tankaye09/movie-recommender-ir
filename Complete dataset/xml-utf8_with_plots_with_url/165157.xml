<plot>ECKIS WORLD is a documentary about the owner of probably the oldest Video-store in the World. Eckhard Baum opened in the summer of 1975 in Kassel, the Film-Shop. With the sale and exchange of Super8 films started everything. Shortly thereafter bought Ecki the first video recorder and took films illegal from tv, but what he still did not know from the movies and on television gave these tapes. Later he bought the first original movies on VHS, Beta and Video2000 order to lend. Today, still more video tapes on the shelves as DVDs. The film shows Ecki with his customers in its video library, his passion for film and his life outside the video-library.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165157</url></doc>
