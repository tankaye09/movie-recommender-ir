<plot>A university professor learns from his golfing partner/hematologist (Tony Oursler) that he has a fatal blood disease. He resolves to live out his remaining weeks doing everything he ever dreamed out. He goes to Paris to rob banks and take up with a bohemian Parisienne named Coco. The only problem is that he can't bring himself to break the law, although Coco is a natural at it. When she discovers he's been faking the robberies their relationship sours. He's got to muster up the fortitude to do the job. Meanwhile his doctor friend has been looking for him - it seems there's been a terrible mix-up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206300</url></doc>
