<plot>"A poker game is played in the far West, between two cowboys and a dude. The tenderfoot holds four aces, but the cowboys call him with their bowie knives. The dude, however, draws two big revolvers, and makes the cowboys leave the room, hands over their heads. When they are gone, the dude pulls a couple of strings from the barrels of the revolvers, and fans instead of bullets come out. This picture has made a tremendous hit wherever it has been shown in the Biograph."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007742</url></doc>
