<plot>God dammit, if you're gonna kill somebody have some fucking taste. I'll drive you to Kenny Roger's house, alright? Bill Hicks, 1990 on John Lennon's untimely death. Bill Hicks was a comedian. He died in 1994 at the age of 32. Who? Julia Menzies, 1994, on Bill Hicks' untimely death. Julia Menzies (22) doesn't know what she wants to do with her life yet, but does know who Bill Hicks is now. In fact, it's her growing obsession with Bill that's fuelling her quest to find a vocation that doesn't demand compromise. Perhaps the pub isn't the best place to look. And maybe her friends and advisors would have a little more credibility if their lives weren't quite so far from what they want them to be. But then this is Edinburgh, and the largest arts festival in the world is on hand to help Julia test if she really has the courage of her convictions. And if not, what's the point?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461263</url></doc>
