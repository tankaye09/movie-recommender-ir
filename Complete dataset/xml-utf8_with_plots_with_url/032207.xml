<plot>Few people outside the director's inner circle knew that Alfred Hitchcock's chief collaborator throughout his career was his wife and muse, Alma Reville Hitchcock. Through interviews with Hitchcock family members and biographers, fascinating stills and never-before-seen home movies, this documentary brings to life the enduring love affair and creative partnership that shaped the work of one of Hollywood's greatest artists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032207</url></doc>
