<plot>"No script, no crew, no budget. Just set up the camera and see what happens. The result is a humble but authentic account from a Harlem high school. It's an unusual documentary by the teacher himself, with many shots from an unmanned camera, and some by his students. Some educators propose forcing kids to learn, by standardized curricula and high stakes testing. "One Teacher" defies this notion, and attempts a more democratic approach. It's an idealistic quest worthy of Don Quixote. "There's always a great sense of hope," we hear, as the school year begins. By the time it ends, we see what happens to that hope. And what it may take to shape the future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412693</url></doc>
