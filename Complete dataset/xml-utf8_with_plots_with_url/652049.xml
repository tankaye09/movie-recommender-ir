<plot>Ed Branningan's great uncle dies and leaves a trunk full of props from the days when Uncle Jackie was a ventriloquist. Buzz, Jackie's dummy, has been locked in the trunk for 50-years; Buzz can also think and talk and goes about giving everyone in the house advise. Ed's family, which lives in Secaucus, New Jersey, consists of his wife Polly and their three children, Tucker, Cory and Maggie; Mrs. Travalony is their next door neighbor. 24 episodes of this syndicated show were produced in 1990 and 1991; the show debuted in September 1990.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652049</url></doc>
