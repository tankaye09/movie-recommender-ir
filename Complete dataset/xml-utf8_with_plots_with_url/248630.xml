<plot>Tallinn mid 1990's. Winter. Carlos, a Colombian man in his mid 30's, comes to Tallinn to visit his old girlfriend, Sonia who's been living in Estonia for some time. In his luggage he brings a small amount of cocaine that he's agreed to sell with her during the time of his visit. He doesn't speak a word of Estonian and he looks ridiculous while trying to deal with the freezing temperatures and the circumstances surrounding Sonia's life. She has a relationship with Tarvo, an Estonian underworld boss and has adapted almost totally to the Estonian way of life. "How to kiss a dead girl" is a story of displacement, of failed attempts at reconnecting and of gaps in human communication.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248630</url></doc>
