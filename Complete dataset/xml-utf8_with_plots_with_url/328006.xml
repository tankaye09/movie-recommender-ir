<plot>After the closing performance of Midsummer Night's Dream at Drew University's New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, one of the principal actors, Campbell, tries to sleep before his flight back to L.A. He has his own midsummer night's dream, constantly interrupted by either a former lover or by friends who have drunk too much. Some of his dream is sweet, with a mystery woman at the seashore; some is nightmarish. Desperate for slumber, he goes to the stage set to Titania's bed, where the woman of his dreams appears as a fairy. Think but this and all is mended, that you have but slumber'd here, while these visions did appear. But, what happens when he wakes?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328006</url></doc>
