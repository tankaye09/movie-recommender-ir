<plot>A film based on a poem than shares thoughts and feelings about loss. One woman lost the child she was carrying before she knew that she wanted it, another woman had her two children taken from her because of substance abuse and a third can never bare children so her husband leaves her. This is the story of three women that lost something that is most considered one of the things that make them women. Although all three women are very different, their paths cross and they start to find a way to overcome their sorrow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?595762</url></doc>
