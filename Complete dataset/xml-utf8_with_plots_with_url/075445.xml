<plot>The town of Whitchurch thought a spate of satanic murders ended when Detective Lyons killed the evil Samuel in a police raid. However, several years later the body count is once again beginning to rise. Recognising the satanic markings, Lyons brings in Alex, the police coroner, to help search for any hidden clues as to who and why the satanic cult has been reborn. As Alex delves deeper into the dark world he puts not only himself but also his family into mortal danger. Watch in suspense as Alex desperately tries to put the pieces of the jigsaw together before his daughter becomes the next victim and literally all hell breaks out. Cleverly combining the gore of Saw, the chills of Halloween and the twists and surprises of Scream, Blood Lust is bound to become a horror classic for bloodthirsty audiences around the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075445</url></doc>
