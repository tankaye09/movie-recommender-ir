<plot>Geeta lives a poor lifestyle near Charni Road, Bombay, along with her widowed mom, and a younger collegian sister, Vasanti. The family is dependent on Geeta, who uses a sewing machine to make ends meet. They rent a room to a ex-college student, Raj, and make some extra income from him. One day he falls ill, Geeta looks after him, and falls in love with him. Vasanti arranges their marriage, both re-locate to Poona, and become parents of a boy, Raja. Shortly thereafter Geeta's mom passes away, and Vasanti moves in with them. After a short while, Geeta notices that Raj and Raja are both spending more and more time with Vasanti than with her, and she starts suspecting that Raj maybe having an affair - not realizing that she may be opening a Pandora's box that may well change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391706</url></doc>
