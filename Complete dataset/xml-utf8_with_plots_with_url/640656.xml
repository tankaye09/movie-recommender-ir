<plot>A film about self-destruction, romance, and everlasting friendship: Ossy (Nikolaj Coster Waldau from "Nattevagten/Nightwatch") and Jimmy (Mads Mikkelsen from "Pusher") are childhood friends from Copenhagen and together they share an experience of a wild life in Thailand. Some years ago Jimmy gave that life up and settled in Iceland, where he now lives the life of ordinary people: a steady job, a wife, and a child. One day Ossy - carrying a deadly secret and in great need of his former confidante - suddenly turns up in Iceland. Jimmy doesn't appreciate the confrontation with his past and he does what he can to deport his old friend. Ossy responds with a vengeance and disrupts Jimmy's peaceful family life. Desperate and for want of ridding himself of Ossy, Jimmy agrees to sell a small portion of heroin for him, but the plan backfires. While Jimmy desperately tries to keep his family together, Ossy plunges into deep water, and ends beaten-up in the Icelandic desert, where he is found by the angelic and beautiful girl Jóna.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640656</url></doc>
