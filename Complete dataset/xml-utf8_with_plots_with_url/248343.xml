<plot>"This film was taken after the popular song by the same title, and is a funny picture indeed. A book agent calls on a woman, who is engaged in washing clothes. He proceeds to try to convince her that she should buy his book, which she flatly refuses. He then tries to make love to her and embraces her, when the iceman, who is her friend, suddenly enters and proceeds to hammer the dude book agent. After throwing him out, he returns, and is rewarded by his lady love with numerous kisses. This is an excellent lively film."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248343</url></doc>
