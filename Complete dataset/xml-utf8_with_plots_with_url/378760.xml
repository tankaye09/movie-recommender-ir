<plot>'Mountain Punks Fight Dirty' explores the relationship between musicians, artists, and the community in which they live. Pushed into the margins of bar culture, some musicians opt out and create their own spaces to play music, dance, and create art. This is the story of the El Nuevo Collective and their desire to create an underground DIY music venue. Hidden from the community at large, spaces like this are under constant threat of closure. Mountain Punks Fight Dirty is about the struggle between the act of creating in a culture that does not value art, expressing oneself against all odds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378760</url></doc>
