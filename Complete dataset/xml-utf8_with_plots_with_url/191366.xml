<plot>Dr. Phillips, a psychologist, speaks into his tape recorder: he's about to interview a couple waiting in his office. The wife reports that her husband, Thomas, has been exhibiting bird-like tendencies. Phillips enters the office and sees Mrs. Marshall and Mr. Marshall perched on the sofa, squawking. Phillips is fairly certain he can't help, but then, an idea crosses his mind. Will he make a successful diagnosis, and, if so, then what? He keeps his Dictaphone close at hand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191366</url></doc>
