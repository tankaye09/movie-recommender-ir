<plot>EXPLORING THE LIFE OF THE UNION SOLDIER Personal belongings open a window into the lives of those who battle in America's Civil War. The stories behind never-before-seen photographs, letters, artifacts and hundreds of rare paintings and engravings complete the picture of the Civil War in CIVIL WAR MINUTES® - Union 2 DVD Box set. Small and unique objects, such as a drum from the Battle of Gettysburg with a hidden note inside, are pieced together to reveal the human element of war. This film also discloses the perspective of the average foot soldier through handwritten letters to family members. The real lives of ordinary people who leave their homes and families behind to answer duty's call for this new and inexperienced nation are featured. This documentary explores soldiers' everyday lives through the personal effects they carry into war. "CIVIL WAR MINUTES® - Union is a treasure trove of interesting information not to be found elsewhere on video." - Don Troiani, Civil War Historian and Artist, America's Civil War Magazine "This compilation of firsthand sources is sure to intrigue Civil War buffs, history enthusiasts and students." - Candace Smith, Booklist - American Library Association "CIVIL WAR MINUTES® - Union goes beyond the epic battles and gets into the heads of the soldiers who lived them." - Maureen Bavdek, Reuters International News Service</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107703</url></doc>
