<plot>Based in a multi-national school in the Caribbean the film takes us through 3 separate tales of how teenagers confront and overcome their fears, with a little help from fairies, forest guardians and goddesses, amongst others. The Good Goddess explains how her sister the Bad Goddess has almost filled up a magic well with children's tears. If the well overflows it would trigger a time where she could rule over the world with her evil magic. By transporting the children to the magic well and introducing them to pirates, guardians of the forest and demons they realize the root of their problems and vow to stop crying, saving the world from the Bad Goddess. It tackles the 3 most universal teen angst problems of anorexia, bullying and lack of confidence. The story culminates with a big birthday party for the students where they are joined by fantasy characters singing the theme song.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153035</url></doc>
