<plot>The gritty, hard pavement of a lonely highway is a path fraught with pain and desperation, but it's also a path that leads to big dreams. Annie Chase leaves everything behind to go to Los Angeles with her rock band seeking fame and fortune. Unfortunately, it's destined to be a disaster when she and her boyfriend, Jake, the guitarist and self-imposed leader of the group, break down in the middle of nowhere. With no money or means to reach the other two band members, who have taken off without them they are forced to turn back and find shelter in a seedy Motel in a racist town in Texas. Planning to stay only long enough to get their car fixed - they find life has other plans. It will be here where parallel lives will cross and force Annie to face the troubles of her past in order to find her true destiny. Annie is on a path destined for fame and fortune and in the midst of it all she finds her own sense of identity. In the end, everyone gets what they wanted all along - just not how they planned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100711</url></doc>
