<plot>A portly gentleman becomes disgusted with his barber and decides to shave himself. Confident that he can do it, he prepares the lather, strops his razor and goes to work. Continually cutting himself, like the proverbial bad workman, he blames it on the razor and gives up in despair. Good and comical.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554584</url></doc>
