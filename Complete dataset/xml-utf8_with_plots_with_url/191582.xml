<plot>What does it mean to love someone? When Julio Esperanza is diagnosed with cancer, he must face his own mortality for the first time. Chemotherapy and radiation treatments leave him sickly, thin, and bald. When his own daughter doesn't recognize him, he is overcome with grief and retreats into loneliness and despair. But faith and hope light the way as Julio's family and friends discover a remarkable and unique way to share his burden. Their creativity and humor are a living example of the transcendent power of love. No man is alone with such friends and Julio Esperanza was blessed with dozens of them. A true story of trial and love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191582</url></doc>
