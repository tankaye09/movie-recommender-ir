<plot>Aloha Life is a documentary based on the Aloha Life workshops presented by host Alika Medeiros. Alika learned of the Aloha Life from his grandmother and it has been passed from generation to generation of Hawaiians through their ancient chants and the hula hula. The Aloha Life is not a new concept, nor is it a secret. It is an education in the old teachings, a balanced system of personal development, healing and spiritual discipline. The world's great teachers have preached for centuries what the the Hawaiian people live through an Aloha Life. The islands of Hawaii hold the key for achieving total personal power, boundless love and an eternal peace - that key is an ALOHA LIFE!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032439</url></doc>
