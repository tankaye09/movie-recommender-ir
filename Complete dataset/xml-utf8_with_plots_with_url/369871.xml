<plot>This primitive railway made of rough logs shows one of the means adopted by the miners in conveying supplies in a new country. Each car, as it approaches, can be seen as it passes to be loaded with all sorts of supplies, which are being transferred by this method from the steamer seen in the distance to another at a point above the rapids. The activity shown in handling these supplies at this point shows that time is an important item in the Klondike.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?369871</url></doc>
