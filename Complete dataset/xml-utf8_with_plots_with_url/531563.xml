Engineer of Death documents the hunt for the Palestinian bomb maker Yehiya Ayyash, who introduced suicide bombing to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Evil Genius tracks Ramzi Yousef, responsible for the World Trade Center bombing of 1993, as he plots his next move while running from justice. Pineapple Face details the transformation of Manuel Noriega from erratic ally to rogue dictator and drug trafficker.
