<plot>Teenagers Toni and Adam are forever struggling to keep up with their confident best friends, Renee and Greg. One night in Toni's bedroom, as Renee and Greg loudly and visibly make out, Toni and Adam can barely even manage a first kiss. Frustrated by their friends' cruel taunts, Toni and Adam dare Renee and Greg to have sex, something they claim to have done many times already. Finding themselves double-dared to have sex in return, Toni and Adam learn that measuring themselves against Renee and Greg won't work when it comes to testing their own boundaries.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032359</url></doc>
