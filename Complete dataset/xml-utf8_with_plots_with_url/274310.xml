<plot>A journalist, Mehta, on the run from Jagmohan's men, leaves an envelope with singer, Ramprasad Singh, and asks him to deliver it to Inspector J.S. Sharma at Bandra (Bomay) Police Station. Subsequently, Mehta is killed. Ramprasad turns over the envelope to Inspector Sharma, and Jagmohan is arrested and sentenced to two years in prison. Then Ramprasad starts receiving threats and threatening phone calls, and asks Sharma for protection. Ramprasad, his wife, Rajni, and son, are enrolled in the Witness Protection Program, and given a new identity. After sometime Jagmohan finds out their whereabouts, and Sharma gets them newer names, this time Catholic names. When Jagmohan gets their whereabouts again, Sharma gets the family Muslim names. Fed up of running for their lives, changing their religion and their location, Ramprasad decides to take on his original name, and return home to Bombay. Once there, Ramprasad devises his very own scheme of getting even with Jagmohan, initially by creating misunderstandings between his men, and getting them to kill each other, and lastly kidnapping Jagmohan's daughter, Komal, and injecting her with cocaine, bringing him into conflict with his own family, and the law.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274310</url></doc>
