<plot>Davor and Nina return to visit their homeland Croatia. Whilst making a documentary in the orphanages of Zagreb they decide to fulfil their dream of a family by adopting a child. Their search begins, they meet Petra a lively and inquisitive girl in her foster home outside Zagreb. Born prematurely to an alcoholic mother and unknown father, Petra suffered from severe neglect before the authorities finally took her away after her mother tried to suffocate her. Passport to Parenthood follows the adoption process which unfolds to become a beaurocratic nightmare. Inconsolable, Nina has to return to work in Melbourne leaving behind Davor and their newly adopted child to await the authorities' decisions. Davor grows into his new role as a father and becomes increasingly intrigued by Petra's past. Petra is also inquisitive, questioning her new family and easing into her new life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425555</url></doc>
