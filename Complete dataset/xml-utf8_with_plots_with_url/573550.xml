<plot>This is funny. A tramp is seen performing with magical effect. He seats himself on a stool which is instantly occupied by a pretty damsel. This is repeated twice over, after which he places the three together and by magic makes one stout one of all. Hitting her on the head with his hat he reduces her to a child. He brings her again to her natural self and then produces the three from the one before him. In his attempt to embrace each one separately, they disappear and he is successively thrown to the ground. Excruciatingly funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573550</url></doc>
