<plot>A video magazine containing clips from many old and new martial arts films, plus interviews with Sammo Hung and many more. There is also a full-length early Jackie Chan film included on the tape, called Young Tiger. Eastern Heroes owner Rick Baker presents the video magazine, at one point going to Hong Kong to interview kung fu stars, visit video stores there, and check out Hong Kong's Planet Hollywood restaurant. Some of the interviews are in Cantonese, with English subtitles. Ken Miller, co-creator of Stop! Kung Fu!, appears as a film reviewer on this tape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164613</url></doc>
