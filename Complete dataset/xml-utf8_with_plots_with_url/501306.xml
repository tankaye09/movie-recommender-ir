<plot>Suffering emotionally from the loss of his wife, within the context of a troubled childhood, a husband dies in his sleep of self-inflicted wounds. This is a story of loss, pain and salvation. It wasn't the pain of a childhood full of physical and emotional abuse that killed him, but the pain of losing the savior he found in his wife. But in an act of mercy and a testament to the depth of the struggle a miracle happens and his body lets go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?501306</url></doc>
