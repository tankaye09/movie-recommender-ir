<plot>Mary lives a wealthy lifestyle near Panaji, Goa, along with her brother, David, and his wife, Eliza, and studies in a Bombay college. When she returns home for the holidays, she is teased and molested by a group led by Viju which she resents. She is then taught to sing by none other than Viju's mother, and shortly thereafter both she and Viju fall in love with each other much to chagrin of Eliza, who is a devout Christian while Viju is a Hindu Brahman. Eliza does not inform David, as he is known to be abusive and may end up beating up Viju and her sister-in-law, so she warns Mary to keep away from David. Eliza makes arrangements for Mary to return to Bombay so that she can forget Viju. Arrangements are made for Mary to leave for Bombay, but on the day of her departure Murphy's law prevails and Eliza and David on one hand, and Mary and Viju on the other hand face challenges that may shatter and change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?345930</url></doc>
