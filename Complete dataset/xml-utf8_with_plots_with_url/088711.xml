<plot>This story is loosely based on the traditional Korean story of the Turtle and the Rabbit. In that story, the sea king is dying and it is determined that only by eating a rabbit's liver will he survive. The turtle is sent to trick the rabbit into accompanying him to his undersea kingdom where the rabbit must use his wits to survive. Well, needless to say, there is no threat to the rabbit's liver in this cutesy-fied version that is targeted at a very young audience. Here the undersea kingdom is threatened by a band of evil, but rarely frightening, sharks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088711</url></doc>
