<plot>Shag Johnson, owner of the Johnson Brothers Rodeo, has been trying for years to gain control of the World-Wide Wild West Show managed by Jennifer Benton, by fair means or foul. Gene Autry and Frog Millhouse arrive on the scene during a battle between the two rival shows and rescue Pa and Ma McCracken from an attack by Johnson's hired henchmen. All hands are carted off to jail, and great crowds are attracted there by Gene's singing, and Pa McCracken decides to add the singing cowboy to his World-Wide show. He does and Gene skyrockets the box-office receipts, which enrages Johnson since it appears certain that World Wide will be able to secure the contract for the annual Capistrano festival and the following Madison Square Garden rodeo. Gene refuses Johnson's offer of $10,000 per week to change shows, and Shag hires Jenkins to burn the Capistrano set-up to the ground. Pa McCracken is seriously injured and Gene learns that only a specialist from the east can save him, and his fee is $5,000. He accepts Johnson's offer in order to pay the doctor, and Jennifer is heartbroken over his apparent disloyalty. At Johnson's show, however, Gene learns of Johnson's duplicity, forces confessions from Shag and Jenkins, makes the former pay Pa's doctor bill and release Gene from his contract.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?064750</url></doc>
