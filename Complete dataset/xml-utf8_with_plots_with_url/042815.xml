<plot>Dingo Egret is an ice harvester on the Jovian moon of Callisto who discovered a lone Orbital Frame, Jehuty. As he is investigating, incoming enemies starts attacking Callisto and Dingo had no choice but to enter and pilot Jehuty. Dingo fights the enemies and upon boarding BAHRAM Ship, Dingo encounters Anubis, an Orbital Frame that is a stronger version of Jehuty. Dingo's Orbital Frame, Jehuty is defeated in battle against Anubis and after that, Nohman, the runner of Anubis told Dingo to come to his office. Upon doing so, Nohman wants Dingo to join him again. Dingo refuses to join and he ended up getting shot in the heart and lungs by Nohman. As Dingo starts dying, a frame runner Ken Marinaris who fought Dingo back at Callisto wants him to help her. Two months later, Ken revived Dingo back to life and told him that his heart and lungs are gone and he must stay in Jehuty so that ADA gives him life supplements for his heart and lungs. Dingo thinks that this is nonsense and as he tries to get up from Jehuty, he starts to sufficate and immediately sits down. Now Dingo knows that from Ken, if he wants his normal body back, he must cooperate with Ken. Can Dingo complete his mission, kill Nohman, destroy Anubis and get his normal body back?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042815</url></doc>
