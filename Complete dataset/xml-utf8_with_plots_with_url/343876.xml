<plot>Shirley, an old box turtle, meets a very lost raccoon, named Fernando Hernandafandavez, and helps him discover the magic of spring. Together they learn the truth about a little fawn who sleeps alone in the woods. Is the fawn lost? Watch as live video is combined with photography from the award-winning children's book Lost in the Woods, by Michigan authors Carl R. Sams II and Jean Stoick. This delightful tale shows what happens to a fawn in its first few weeks of life, with vivid images of spring and live, behavioral footage of forest animals. Original songs include a lounge-singing tree frog's jazzy tune, 'The Signs of Spring,' and a comforting lullaby sung by Mother Doe to her fawn before she leaves him alone in the grasses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343876</url></doc>
