It's where people talk about their problems, fall in love and learn about life. Follow the comic mis-adventures of three men as they figure out what it means to eat at the House of Luk. Marshall Cotton, is a balding, middle-aged down-and-out salesman who's always selling the wrong thing-including his ex-wife!

Chuck Warden is a building contractor who lives with his silent mother and emotionally distant son. Desperate to bring harmony into his home he discovers a very special way of reaching out to his family and communicating the love he feels for them. Lording over them all is Kwang Luk, the restaurant's Buddha-like proprietor who gives Marshall, Ho Fook and Chuck each a fortune cookie with a cryptic message.
