<plot>Max Avery is a Freediver. On a single breath, he dives over 400 feet deep in the ocean in an extreme sport that has been castigated by the media as suicidal. But for Max Avery, the ocean breathes life into the central problem that he faces. He struggles with an ailment affecting his lungs, and to cope with the pain and uncertainty of the disease, he turns to the water. Here, he finds himself transformed in a way that offers a new reality; one of peace and connectedness. A secret reality known by others that have explored the same dark and primordial waters. On his quest to break the world record, he discovers this secret to eclipse any measure of achievement coming from the record itself. But failing to convince others of this can end his chances to continue, which for Max, becomes a life or death issue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562526</url></doc>
