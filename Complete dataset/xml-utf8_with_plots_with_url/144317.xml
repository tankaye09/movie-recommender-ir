<plot>Rahul works as a Manager with a Hotel that was formerly owned by Bajaj, but after his suicide, Prem purchases the hotel and moves in along with his newly-wed wife, Anjali, and sister, Pooja, who is in love with Rahul. They decide to hold a dual celebration for Prem's wedding and the hotel ownership. After the announcement, Pooja gets an anonymous telephone call that Prem's life is in danger. She summons the Police, and Inspector Suraj Malhotra attends with several policemen. Despite of the police presence, Prem is killed after drinking a poisoned alcoholic drink. Suraj decides to hold every guest at the party within the hotel boundaries. He even labels Rahul, Pooja, and Anjali in the long line of suspects which include Nisha, Anand Bajaj, Jatin, Rakesh, and Vicky. Things spiral out of control as one by one the suspects are killed with the Police having no clues whatsoever behind the new killings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144317</url></doc>
