<plot>A heady brew of interlocking stories set around the habitu√©s of a legendary Soho drinking den. Tall tales of rooftop golf; lawyers who find they can no longer lie; murderous chefs and an orphaned dog. Tales of love and death, wonder and woe, threaded with poker tips, hangover cures and bar stool philosophy. Real life, should it ever catch them up, would be the Mother Of All Hang-overs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338122</url></doc>
