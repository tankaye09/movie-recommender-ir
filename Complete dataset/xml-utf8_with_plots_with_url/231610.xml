<plot>This scene "Hauling in a Big Catch" or "Seining Salmon with Horses" is one of the most interesting subjects ever made. The Columbia River is the home of the king of all food fish (The Royal Chinook Salmon) and is found nowhere else. Here is shown a scene where they are using horses to drag in the heavy seines filled with salmon. The tide rises and falls and you see the horses along one of these bars up to the girth, splashing in the water, throwing the spray in every direction, thus making it a subject of more than usual interest. Very sharp and clear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231610</url></doc>
