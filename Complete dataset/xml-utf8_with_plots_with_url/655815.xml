<plot>The scene opens in the bedroom of Mr. Nation, husband of the famous Carrie Nation, the "Kansas Saloon Smasher." Mr. Nation suddenly arises from the bed and picks up a crying infant from the cradle, and walks it up and down the floor. He suddenly steps upon a tack, becomes infuriated, and throws the baby back into the cradle. A small boy in the bed next demands his attention.
