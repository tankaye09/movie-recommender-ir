<plot>Stan "The Man" Henry is the brash host of a local Austin, Texas radio call-in show. On a particular September morning, he goes through his usual live routine, calculating and filtering comments surrounding national identity and ownership. He finally meets his match when he tries to tone down the meaning of the words spoken by one Native American caller. In eight brief minutes, Yada Yada portrays one moment of historic reality and contrasts it with modern history in the making.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663498</url></doc>
