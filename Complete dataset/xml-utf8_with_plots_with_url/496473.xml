<plot>Sight Lines explores the many ways in which people of all ages escape from the reality of their lives. Brina, 13 years old, and her cousin Daniel, are spending the summer at her Grandmother's cottage. It appears that the hot days will be withered away as Brina drifts in and out of her own world, detached from everyone around her, until she is forced to spend time with Fletcher, a young boy living nearby. Fletcher's directness comes like a splash of cold water to Brina, who has for most of her life been sheltered from the truth by the adults around her. However, it isn't long before she sees Fletcher's behaviour as just another way of masking the truth. As the deception around her begins to unfold, Brina realizes that everyone, including herself, has been denying their reality. Fed up, Brina pulls herself out of it, confronting not only the people around her, but also the camera itself, which has been complicit in Brina's denial of the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?496473</url></doc>
