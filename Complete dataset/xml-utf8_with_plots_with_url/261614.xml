<plot>About a man's vendetta against a rich man who got away with killing his wife in a horrific car crash, and his ultimate goal is to make him "experience" the deep burning pain that he had to go through, no matter what, no matter by what means, no matter who. He starts by befriending the rich man's daughter, who is an actress, in a twist of events and through his cunning ability to formulate complex plans. He ends up confronting the rich boss who killed his wife, with only a camcorder as a means of fruitful revenge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261614</url></doc>
