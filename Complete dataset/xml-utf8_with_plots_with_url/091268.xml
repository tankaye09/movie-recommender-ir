<plot>Morgan and her, "B" movie writing husband, Coral, relocate to Los Angeles because of her new job, when she's invited to a party by the bosses daughter, Sonja. The party introduces the unknowing couple to the steamy, passionate, and lust-filled lifestyle of the swingers scene. However, Morgan gets more than she bargained for when Coral continues to have a heated affair with Sonja that leads to a trail of murder and deceit. But as police detectives Ellis and Winters investigate the murder they soon realize the events from the case closely parallel what's happening in Coral's unfinished movie script.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091268</url></doc>
