<plot>The sounds of Jimmie Rodgers, Spade Cooley, and Earl Scruggs are played weekly by local artists in a traditional gathering called The Hoot. From under a bridge spanning the Snake River, the "Teton Tea Parties" may have been the beginning of the Jackson Hole Hootenanny. Brought to life by extreme ski-mountaineer and folk musician Bill Briggs in the early 1950's, a musical tradition picked out its first notes beneath the sparkling night skies of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Now playing the stage at Dornan's in Moose, WY, the Hoot showcases talented homegrowns like the dynamic duo Anne and Pete Sibley and traveling musical acts such as The Wilders to standing-room-only listeners. The Hootenanny stage has been graced with nationally known artists such as Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Chuck Pyle playing with the likes of Bill Briggs, Dick Barker, John Byrne Cooke, and renowned harmonica player John Kuzloski.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245264</url></doc>
