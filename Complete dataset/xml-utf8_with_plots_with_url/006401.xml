<plot>'60 years on: from despair to joy' tells the moving story of 55 men, who traveled from their homes in the US to the Warsaw ghetto and the concentration/death camps at Auschwitz and Birkenau. They then go straight to Israel, to be in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in time to celebrate Israel's 60th anniversary of it's founding. The journey includes Sderot, a town under constant threat of missiles from Gaza. Narrated by Matt Lauer and using historical and current day footage, the story unfolds through the eyes and feelings of three sons of concentration camp survivors, a son-in-law of a US soldier who liberated the camps and two men with no direct connection at all. They went to find their roots. They found so much more. It was the most memorable seven days of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006401</url></doc>
