<plot>Aaron and his ambitious actress girlfriend, Kenya, have run into some hard times. After moving to L.A. from Atlanta with Kenya, Aaron has had a rough go of in finding work and as a result their relationship has suffered. To top if off, he's suspicious of Kenya's 'networking' and she's more interested in him just getting off of the couch than elaborating on where she was the night before. However, Aaron's time isn't entire spent on the couch while Kenya works during the day. He's found an outlet in a sardonic if not especially passionate affair with the manager of the Vista/View apartment building, Wanda. It is also a diversion for Wanda whose obsessing about the whereabouts of building maintenance man, Gustavo, and spurning the advances of the lonesome Simon are just about all that she has to look forward to during the day. Perturbed by their May/December interracial affair is Snyder, the building's resident curmudgeon and thorn in the side of the lovelorn Simon. Snyder's actions precipitate the figurative earthquake that Aaron hopes will just 'shake things up'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641963</url></doc>
