<plot>Ace Stradlin knows he's the King of Karaoke - now all he has to do is convince the rest of the world. From sleazy bars and street corners, to bus stops and laundromats - Ace hones his skills - unleashing his raw tal-ent on anyone brave enough to stop and lis-ten as he pursues his quest for the elusive fame and fortune he feels he so richly de-serves. No crowd is too small for Ace - if you're a party of one, you're still a party - nor too large. An impromptu Tiffany-style performance at a shopping mall gives him just the confidence he needs to proceed to his dream gig - a national Karaoke com-petition in Las Vegas - where he is certain he will attain superstardom. Fame isn't everything - it's the only thing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292551</url></doc>
