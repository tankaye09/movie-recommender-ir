<plot>The Home unfolds after a young man is nearly killed during an accident that leaves him physically and emotionally scarred. To recuperate, he is taken to a secluded nursing home where the elderly residents appear to be suffering from delusions. But after witnessing a violent attack, he soon realizes that the screams behind the walls are caused by more than hallucinations, and the residents are being preyed upon by twisted, monstrous nightmares that lurk within the home itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564808</url></doc>
