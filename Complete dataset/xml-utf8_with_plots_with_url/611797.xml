<plot>It's Christmas Eve and like every other boy, Tom Hobbs is counting down the minutes to presents and parties. But Tom is in for a shock when his pregnant mother is taken to hospital. Tom is packed off to the only relative without plans for the holidays. At his Aunt Em's there are no paper chains or even a cracker to be found. Tom can't hide his disappointment. He set's off to find his own Christmas tree and on his quest, travels back to a Christmas card vision of a Victorian Yuletide and meets a host of fantastic characters including: The King Of The Night, a trio of rather grumpy fairies and of course, Father Christmas himself. With a little help from his new friends Tom has a Christmas more exciting than he could have ever imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611797</url></doc>
