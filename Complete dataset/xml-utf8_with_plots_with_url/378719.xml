<plot>"Taken on the line of the Mt. Tamalpais scenic railroad, Marin county, California, from a flat car following the engine. On the front end of the flat car is seen some tourists, and also a brakeman who from time to time sets up or loosens the brakes as the grades demand. In the background is a panoramic view of the hills and valleys appear as the train ascends the mountain. The engine which draws the car from which our picture is taken, is plainly seen at different points of the film and takes up all the foreground. The working of the piston rods and revolving of the wheels are distinctly shown and the effect is very pleasing."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378719</url></doc>
