<plot>"High Water" is an action-packed adventure centered around surfing's Triple Crown competitions,the professional surfing tour's final three competitions held each year on the North Shore of Oahu. Starting on Halloween and ending around Christmas, it attracts the sport's best surfers to the legendary North Shore, known for its huge waves and unparalleled surf. The Triple Crown is the ultimate proving ground for world class surfers, but the events also lure amateurs, surfers young and old, and hopefuls to the North Shore; where population, tension and commerce swell during the competition. Real life drama, humor, death-defying waves, rivalries, parties, heart-break, romance, injuries, and humanity all collide during the nearly two month competition on Hawaii's "7 Mile Miracle". The film will follow multiple story lines over the course of the entire competition and will rely upon Dana Brown's unique ability to take cinematic events and populate them with heroes and everyday people to construct a moving story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239222</url></doc>
