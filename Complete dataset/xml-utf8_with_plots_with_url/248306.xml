<plot>Uncle Josh is called to the door by a very attractive lady who endeavors to interest him in a new book. She induces him to take a seat by her on a settee, and by seductive smiles and very persuasive actions, succeeds in overcoming his shyness and sells him a book, closing the bargain with a hearty kiss. At this moment a co-conspirator enters with a camera and unobserved, secures a picture of Uncle Josh. He then makes his exit, and the young lady follows. The photographer re-enters, shows the picture, and attempts to extort money from Uncle Josh, but Uncle Josh gets a back hold and hurls him headlong down the well. At this point Aunt Jerusha returns and chastises Josh in a manner which she considers suitable for the occasion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248306</url></doc>
