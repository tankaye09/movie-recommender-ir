<plot>A very famous trivia game plays a major role in this story about two couples who experiment with the game and use some of the answers to follow up on their own rampant sexual fantasies. George and Sue are an inexperienced but charming younger couple who are in love, but not unwilling to learn about the more esoteric ways of pursuing sexual satisfaction. Their friends, Jim and Joanne, are older, more sophisticated and comfortable with themselves and their sexuality. They lead our novice lovers on an exciting game plan that includes body painting, rose petals, liqueur, love oils and a climactic marathon session of trivia games that you won't find on sale at your local game store!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267338</url></doc>
