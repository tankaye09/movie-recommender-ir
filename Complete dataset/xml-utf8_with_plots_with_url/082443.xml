<plot>If you could find out you were at risk for breast cancer, could you live with that knowledge? Could you live without it? BREAST CANCER LEGACY is the one-hour Discovery Health Channel documentary that tells the incredible stories of young women who have a family history of disease. In this program, they confront the breast cancer histories that haunt their pasts, while exploring how advances in genetic science may help them change their futures. Featuring interviews with women making tough choices, as well as genetic counselors, the U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Olufunmilayo Olopade (Director of the Center of Cancer Genetics at the University of Chicago Hospitals), Sue Friedman (founder of FORCE, Facing our Risk of Cancer Empowered), and leading experts at the National Human Genome Research Project.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082443</url></doc>
