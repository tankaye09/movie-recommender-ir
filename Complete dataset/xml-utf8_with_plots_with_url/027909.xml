<plot>This film dwells on a Papuan teenage boy (Arnold, 15 years), who meets a woman at the port and is obsessed by a desire to kiss her. At the same time, his father (Berthold, 41 years), an activist and a cassowary dance instructor, is being hunted down by some unknown people because of his political activities to demand justice for the detention of Theys Eluay, chairman of the Papuan Council Presidium. The woman, who always cries and reads the Bible, the object of Arnold's obsessive desire, seems to be Arnold's way to find himself and read the life around him. Various incidents have taken place at the same time, the death of Theys Eluay after he was kidnapped and the changes in the attitude of his own friends. Sonya has her racist envy, and Minus has lost his ability to whistle, something very important to him. Meanwhile, the father chooses to hide because he is afraid of being hunted down and murdered, especially after Theys's murder. Arnold's obsession to kiss the woman has suddenly become the way for the characters in this film to find themselves. The woman who always cries has tried to find how many times the expression "Don't fear" is mentioned in the Bible. The whole thing is the way of finding oneself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027909</url></doc>
