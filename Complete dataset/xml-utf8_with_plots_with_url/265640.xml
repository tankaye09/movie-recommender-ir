<plot>Jageera Singh has always lived a life of crime, drinking alcohol and frequenting brothels, even though he is married to pregnant Laxmi, and has a son named Vikram. On the day of Laxmi's delivery, Jageera is busy molesting young Paro. Laxmi gives birth to a daughter, Jyoti, who is subsequently abducted. Jageera disappears from Laxmi's life, and she goes to live with a female friend who passes away, leaving Laxmi with the responsibility of also looking after her son, Virendra alias Veeru. Years later Jageera surfaces and joins forces with smuggler and prominent citizen, Bhanupratap. When Police Inspector Vikram's diligence causes problems for Bhanupratap, Jageera offers to kill Vikram, especially when Bhanupratap's niece, Priya, falls in love and wants to marry Vikram. It is at this point that the past will re-visit Jageera where he will come face to face with his past wrong actions and the devastation that he has inflicted on his family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265640</url></doc>
