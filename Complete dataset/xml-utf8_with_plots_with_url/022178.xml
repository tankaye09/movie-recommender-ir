<plot>Shortly after the beginning of the new millenium, deep-space observation led to a chilling conclusion: the Earth would soon be hit by a group of small asteroids. In desperation, the country of Erusea developed Stonehenge, a massive anti-air ballistic weapon, in the center of the Usea continent. The weapon, for the most part, worked. However, after the danger passed, Erusea realized just how powerful a weapon it had. Using Stonehenge, Erusea established air superiority over the entire Usea continent. Conventional ground forces were no match for aerial bombardment from the Erusea air force, and the Independant States Allied Forces (ISAF) were forced to retreat to the island of North Point, beyond Stonehenge's range. Weakened and fragmented, ISAF learns of a final air strike to be conducted on their headquarters and scrambles what few pilots it has left to counter-attack. The player takes control of a rookie pilot, known only by the callsign Moebius-1, and takes a vital role in ISAF's efforts to defeat Erusea and end the war.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022178</url></doc>
