<plot>Follows the plight of a young beauty as she flees from a mysterious pursuer through the halls of an abandoned building. As she is trapped at a dead end inside of a freight elevator, all hope seems lost until fate places two rescuers in the pursuer's path. A fight ensues, but who will win? And is our damsel in distress any safer if the other guys win? The Chase is the result of a self-imposed challenge by the filmmakers to produce a silent, yet compelling martial-arts driven story in an enclosed environment - a live-action Anime. Using the same location and scenario, a film version was shot by film purist Robert Banks for the purpose of comparison between style and medium.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548179</url></doc>
