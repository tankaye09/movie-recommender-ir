<plot>This documentary is dedicated to the great love of Japanese journalist Yoshinori Maeda and Bulgarian girl Anastasiya Makrelova-Maeda. They were brought together during the hard times of the WWII in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Against the background of the stormy events in Bulgaria's and Japan's history in the 20 c., the film reveals the major role Maedas played in developing the Bulgarian-Japanese relations. Few years after their marriage, Yashinori Maeda became President of N.H.K.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?348249</url></doc>
