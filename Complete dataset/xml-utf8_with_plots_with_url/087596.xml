<plot>BUSINESS AS USUAL is an experimental film about the corporate everyman captured in motion against the backdrop of his natural habitats. Archetypal gestures were filmed in front of the empirical stock exchange buildings of Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE), London (FTSE) and Tokyo (TSE) and then edited and manipulated as a collage-in-motion. BUSINESS AS USUAL reveals the grotesquely human nature of the executive citizen and questions the threatening prevalence of global economic markets as the new world culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087596</url></doc>
