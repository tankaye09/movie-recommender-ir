<plot>Chip &amp; Friends Interactive V1.0 presents a variety of important computer related topics in a manner that all children can easily learn and understand. Adapted from the original Chip &amp; Friends Video/Handbook Scholastic Program, this Interactive version is intended to be used in both the scholastic and private sectors. Designed to make the challenges of teaching computer etiquette to a child simpler, Chip &amp; Friends is not merely a game but an entire educational experience. It consists of seven interactive games, each with its own video that addresses individual issues and introduces the topic at hand. A Gaming Guide and a Teachers Guide have also been included, as well as, a printable poster of Chip and his parts, rules and glossary that can be hung by your computer. By following the provided guidelines, these materials will give your child an initial understanding of what computers are, how to take care of them, and the rules they need to follow in order to become responsible computer users.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103858</url></doc>
