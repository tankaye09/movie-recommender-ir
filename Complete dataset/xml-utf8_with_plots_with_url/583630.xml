<plot>Todd is struggling with his identity. He and his wife, Nancy, are recently married and deeply in love. When Nancy becomes pregnant, Todd's mind begins to wander. He is wary because he is adopted and fears that this will affect his future with Nancy. He must confront his internal fears in order to secure a life with Nancy. Todd looks to his parents for advice, but they do not give him concrete answers. After Nancy miscarries, Todd decides to find his birth mother and confront the fears he has held throughout his life. The fear that his past is affecting his family is all too real. Todd presses his birth mother for information and discovers his once hidden past. Todd and Nancy must make a decision if their marriage is strong enough to withstand the new knowledge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583630</url></doc>
