<plot>Transitioning into manhood is proving difficult for Ezra, an irresponsible young carpenter on the island Martha's Vineyard. His customers don't respect him and he's lost the mother of his child to an equally unimpressed new boyfriend. In an attempt to win back his family by making his ex jealous, Ezra strikes up a relationship with Naomi, a mysterious out of towner who appears to be vacationing alone. His plan shows signs of weakness when he begins to develop real feelings for Naomi. Then without warning, two scorned men from Naomi's past show up with very specific agendas. Ezra's world is turned upside down as violence erupts and the lives of those he cares for most are put on the line.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072946</url></doc>
