<plot>"Confession: A film about Ariel Schrag" explores 23 year-old Ariel Schrag's world in which she negotiates fame, obsesses about disease, and discusses the way she sees as a dyke comic book artist. Schrag's autobiographical work is of vital importance because it chronicles the underground world of teen dyke culture in all of its raw, sexual, and complicated glory- in a way that is rarely recognized or represented in mainstream art, literature, or media. Of note: Currently Ariel is adapting her third book "Potential" into a narrative feature film that is being produced by Christine Vachon's Killer Films company.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113743</url></doc>
