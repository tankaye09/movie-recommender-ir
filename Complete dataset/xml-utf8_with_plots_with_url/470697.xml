He is very organized, thrifty and plans to get his children educated, married, and also build a house. Nirmala befriends Kishore Kumar Shastri, who lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his widower dad, a Deputy, and runs two businesses for supply of sand and cement. Kishore manages to impress everyone in Nirmala's family, including her paternal uncle, Sadhuram. Sewakram goes to meet with Mr. Shastri to finalize their marriage and after doing so he returns to the construction site and is gravely injured when an entire floor collapses.
