<plot>JAMES GILL FULL CIRCLE is an unprecedented look into the world of a true pop art icon. Witness his incredible journey from a small town in Texas to the bright lights of Hollywood. Rubbing shoulders with the truly rich and famous and keeping the company of celebrated movie stars, James Gill found himself in the fast lane to success. At the height of fame and popularity, exhibiting alongside greats such as Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein he suddenly disappeared. Staying away for over 30 years this legendary icon has made his way back. Once again exhibiting at sold out shows this remarkable story of an artist rediscovered truly brings you full circle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273355</url></doc>
