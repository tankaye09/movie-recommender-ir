<plot>'The Bear' is based on a true story about an Englishman named John who joins his brother-in-law and some French-Canadians on a fishing trip. Tensions flare when Pierre, who isn't very fond of the English, joins the group. He tells a tall tale about a man-eating bear who lives in the woods to which they are headed. They travel by float plane and arrive at their cabin, where John is trained to use a rifle. During the pitch-black night, John is awoken by a noise on the balcony. He communicates with Pierre, who also suspects a bear lurking outside. John grabs the rifle and clumsily shoots, narrowly missing Pierre (the bear), who runs into the cabin, his pants around his ankles. The men reconcile their differences, and Pierre's tall tale of a man-eating bear is replaced by the daring Brit who saved him from it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542424</url></doc>
