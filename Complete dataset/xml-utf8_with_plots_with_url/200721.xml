<plot>Will, a talented singer-songwriter, is struggling to cope with a tragic secret. Eve, who works in the local bar, enters his life when he is at his lowest ebb. After rescuing her from an aggressive customer at closing time, Will is caught off guard by the instant spark between them and the release of dormant emotions. Independent and free spirited, Eve reminds Will of the person he once was. Captivated, Will's heart pulls him in an unexpected direction as Eve offers him an opportunity to rediscover love and life. But torn by conflicting emotions, he is afraid of opening up his life to someone new, all too aware of the painful consequences for them both. Forget Me Not follows Will and Eve as they journey through London, not knowing what the night holds or what the next day will bring. As dawn turns to light and the sun rises over the city, can Will find the courage to reveal the truth?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200721</url></doc>
