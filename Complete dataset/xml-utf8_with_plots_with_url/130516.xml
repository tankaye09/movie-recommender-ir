<plot>Winter scene on Front street, Dawson City, with the thermometer forty-five degrees below zero. This is a very interesting scene, showing the fire department going to a fire. Horses were very scarce at the time, and were so slow in their movements over the frozen streets that it causes great amusement to the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130516</url></doc>
