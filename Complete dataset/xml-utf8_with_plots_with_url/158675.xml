<plot>In the summer of 2004, filmmaker Yiqing Zhao traveled to Labrang Monestary on a pilgrimage. She went to find a deeper understanding of the age old truths of Buddhism, of all religions. What is the meaning of life? What is a purposeful life? She expected to find the answers among the lamas and temples. Instead, she found it in the works of a simple country doctor. High maternal death rate. High infant mortality rate. High disease rate. Little or no education. Poverty. Women on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau face incredible hardships. Often living in very isolated areas, health care is unavailable or inadequate. This situation is made worse by lack of resources, traditional practices, local superstitions, and cultural taboos. In the midst of a genuine health care crisis, one doctor struggles to make a difference.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158675</url></doc>
