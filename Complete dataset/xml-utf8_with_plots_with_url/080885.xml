<plot>Two men engage in a bowling contest, meanwhile imbibing from bottles of "hard stuff" near at hand. The balls return to them in the usual manner for a little while, but fail to come back fast enough to suit one of the players, who uncovers a box standing near which contains a number of balls. As soon as he removes the lid the balls rise and float in the air and the men throw themselves on the floor and cover their heads in fear of the floating globes falling on them. Very fine.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080885</url></doc>
