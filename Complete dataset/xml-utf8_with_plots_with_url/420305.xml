<plot>What seems to be just another regular check-up for Dan Kirchner quickly becomes a suspicious examination by Dr. Seymour Smith, whom is in fact Satan in disguise. With the exception of his black fingernails and the two horns protruding from his forehead Dr. Smith displays little evidence of his true identity. It's a cat and mouse game; Dan constantly aware of Dr. Smith's intentions, and Dr. Smith playing the friendly physician. Dan doesn't fall for Dr. Smith tricks quite so easily and it takes the offer of the perfect "life insurance policy" to test Dan's judgment. Will Dan agree to the terms and sign the contract?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420305</url></doc>
