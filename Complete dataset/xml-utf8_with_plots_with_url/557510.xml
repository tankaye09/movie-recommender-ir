<plot>"Cuba has presented several novelties but none more comical than the mascot which the fighting fifth regulars smuggled back with them to America from the war: one of the native burros or donkeys which for months had been the pet of the camp, learning soldier ways and unsoldierlike tricks. The little beast was brought back to Ft. Sheridan with the regiment and our film shows him in one of his favorite pursuits engaging in an active wrestling match with one of the soldier boys, a pastime in which 'Brother Burro' generally came out best. This is a very clear film and amusing beyond description."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557510</url></doc>
