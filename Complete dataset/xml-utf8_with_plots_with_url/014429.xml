<plot>An emotionally charged tale of a disconnected family whose spirits are rekindled with the help of a friend and a shared love of music. In his private moments, Zach Taylor relives his glory days as jazz trumpeter Pepper Taylor. But fear of failure has paralyzed his spirit and seemingly robbed him of his passion. So, instead of performing his soulful music in a smoky night club, dispirited Zach holes himself up in a makeshift studio hideaway, detached from his family, and bitterly churning out commercial ditties for any job his sleazy agent throws his way. Zach's wife Jasmine, once a steamy jazz pianist, buries her long-forgotten dreams in a hectic real estate career; while 16 year-old daughter Iris is seduced away from her beloved jazz trio to play with a punk band. When old friend and jazz singer Rhea comes into town for a gig, she sees that the family is in a shambles. They're living a lie, and letting themselves - and each other down. Now Rhea could well be the angel that helps them get back on track.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014429</url></doc>
