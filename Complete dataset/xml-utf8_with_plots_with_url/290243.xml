<plot>Siavash left Iran years ago illegally and lives in Sweden with his wife and two children. Realizing he wants to go back for a visit, he decides the best place to go is a free port, which doesn't require a visa. Being there he feels he is in Iran, but it does not fully satisfy his nostalgic longing, as his old home is on the mainland. On the island, Siavash comes face to face with the danger that awaits him if he returns home and he must decide what is most important to him: his future or his past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290243</url></doc>
