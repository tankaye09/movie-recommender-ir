<plot>The film tells Sam Peckinpah's career up to 1970 and the making of his first non-western feature film: STRAW DOGS. Shot in Cornwall/England in the winter 1970/71, the film was controversial since it was first released and even banned or cut in certain countries during its initial release. On home video the film was banned in the UK and in Germany for two decades (in its uncut form). Cast and crew members remember the shooting. Sam Peckinpah himself tells his point of views. With rare production stills, behind the scenes footage and film clips.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425340</url></doc>
