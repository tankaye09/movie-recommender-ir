<plot>When he loses his job and his girlfriend on the same day, a wealthy businessman is left to care for a young son he hardly knows. After spending a few weeks as an unwilling stay-at-home dad, he calls his estranged college-aged daughter and asks her to live with him and care for the boy until he gets back on his feet. Directionless and looking for a free ride, his daughter accepts this awkward proposition, but neither of them anticipates how this "solution" will affect the young boy. Soon the ex-girlfriend insinuates herself into this makeshift family, pushing the daughter away from her father before they can come to terms with their past and make sense of their chaotic present.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045901</url></doc>
