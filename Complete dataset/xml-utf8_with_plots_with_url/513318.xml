<plot>"Stanley Ann Dunham - A Generous Spirit" will be the first documentary film to explore the life of this fascinating, singular figure. Universal in its appeal, the film will be directed by celebrated, internationally renowned filmmaker Charles Burnett ("Killer of Sheep," "To Sleep With Anger"). Shot on location in the U.S. and Indonesia, it will document the complete biography of Dunham's life from her all-American childhood as the only child of working class parents through her motherhood as the unlikely sole parent of the future President of the U.S., and finally to her trail-blazing work in micro-finance. Throughout, original interview footage (more than 30 interviews have been identified) will be inter-weaved with archival photographs of Dunham and her family as well stock footage and period music to reflect the various chapters in her story. Ultimately, the film will show how the decisions made by a young woman with a fierce spirit of independence and an idealism grounded in the American work-ethic would go onto change not only the lives around her but leave its inedible mark on history.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513318</url></doc>
