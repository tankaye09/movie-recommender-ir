<plot>Six months after Bob Mader passed away in 2005, his son, Austin filmmaker Filmmaker Berndt Mader discovers his deceased father's camera loaded with a last roll of film. In an attempt to deal with his grief, Mader decides to finish this final roll in the small Mexican village of Tlacotepec-a town his father had visited and photographed 40 years before. On his journey to this obscure Mexican village, Berndt is diverted to the country of Belize where his sister has run into legal trouble in her attempts at an international adoption. After this detour and other misadventures, Berndt finally makes it to the town of Tlacotepec, where he discovers possible connections to the past and answers to questions of his own memory.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465070</url></doc>
