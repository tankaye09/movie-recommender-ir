<plot>One of the finest storm scenes every made upon the ocean. Our photographer, while crossing the Atlantic Ocean on board the Steamship Maria Theresa, of the North German Lloyd S.S. Co., encountered a terrific gale. The camera was placed on the after-deck of the ship and focused on the forward deck and bow. As the ship tosses and plunges into the huge waves, the spray is plainly seen dashing over the decks. Several passengers who are clinging to the safety ropes on board the ship are thrown violently from side to side as the vessel rolls and tosses in the trough of the heavy sea. A most beautiful and perfect ocean scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472265</url></doc>
