<plot>A young stand-up comedienne struggles to make sense of her life and career after losing 170 pounds. WHAT'S SO FUNNY? follows Jessica Fischer's journey after having gastric bypass surgery. Not only does she lose the weight, but also her drive and ability to perform comedy, which she perceived as her "ticket" into the world of entertainment. While her physical transformation is remarkable, it is the emotional turmoil she experiences afterwards which is truly life changing and proves to be more than she bargained for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652296</url></doc>
