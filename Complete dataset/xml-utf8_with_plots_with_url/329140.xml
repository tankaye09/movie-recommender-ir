<plot>From Legend to Tragedy. The name of former University of Maryland basketball superstar and Boston Celtics draft pick Len Bias still provokes powerful, and immediate responses, more than 20 years after his death. The most ambitious, comprehensive and uncompromising account of Bias' life and death is revealed in an explosive documentary, featuring interviews with his closest teammates, friends and family. For the first time, we hear first-hand accounts of what transpired during Bias' final hours from those who were with him at the time of his death. His heartbreaking fall from grace changed the game forever...on the court, where many considered him to be Michael Jordan's closest rival...and in the courtroom, where generations continue to face the harsh punishment of the nation's drug policies that were influenced by his controversial death. Len Bias is a must-see chronicling of how one man's meteoric rise to fame was derailed by a fatal decision that still echoes throughout sports and the criminal justice system.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329140</url></doc>
