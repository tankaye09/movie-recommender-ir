<plot>Goa-based Shekhar Kapoor travels to Mahabaleshwar in search of a job, ends up at Laila's Bar, where he is mistaken for a Contract Killer by Pratap Singh and the bar's owner, Laila, and asked to kill Pratap's paternal niece, Sonali. Unable to tell them about this true identity for fear of being killed, Shekhar accepts the contract, goes to meet Sonali, and ends up telling her the truth, which she gratefully accepts. On the way to Goa, Shekhar's vehicle runs over a man named Madan, who he assists by taking him to a hospital. This is where he will find out that the man who hired him to kill Sonia is none other than the district Superintendent of Police - who is bent on killing him - by hook or by crook - assisted by C.B.I. man Shekhar Amritsari. Watch what happens when Shekhar goes on the run with none other than Sonia - with the Police &amp; Pratap hot pursuit - in a deadly game of lies and deceit where no one is who they claim to be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659589</url></doc>
