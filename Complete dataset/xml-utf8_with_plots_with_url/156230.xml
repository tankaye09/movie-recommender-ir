<plot>Pete spends his morning patrolling a park, teaching himself how to whistle. While somewhere out there a cop is busting gang bangers, running down suspects, and solving murders, Pete's biggest hazard on the security guard beat is a close tie between fending off boredom and dealing with disaffected teenagers who throw a candy bar at his head between hits from a doobie. On break, Pete waits in line at a nearby donut shop. When Pete corrects a little boy who excitedly mistakes him for a cop, the little boy's shoulders drop in disappointment. How can adults, teenagers, or even children respect a security guard when he swaps shifts with a 65 year old woman? Pete's day takes a turn for the better when strangely, a beautiful, mysterious woman takes notice of him and strikes up a flirtatious conversation, eying his badges and well ironed uniform. Pete doesn't exactly say he IS a cop, but he doesn't exactly admit he ISN'T either. Things seem to be going Pete's way, when the doors to the donut shop kick open and the worst day of all time waltzes in, brandishing hellfire spittin' guns and the attitude to match. As tension mounts, the whole donut shop looks to Pete to save them. Pete has to go along with being a 'cop' or risk losing the girl, but who is he to save the day either? And if a cop-like-badge doesn't make it Pete's responsibility to do something, who's responsibility is it? Terror will reign. Love will be tested. And one man will rise, a donut shop hero.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?156230</url></doc>
