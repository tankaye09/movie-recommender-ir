<plot>Six-year-old Andong is obsessed, and nothing, not even his mother's disapproval and constant nagging can help curve his, somewhat, persistent infatuation. So it didn't come out as a surprise to anyone, when, one fateful day, the precocious little boy went into a mad frenzy over the prospect of, finally, landing the much-coveted love-of-his-life. For a poor boy who only yearned for one thing - and nothing more, in his life, this break was, without a doubt, the answer to all of his prayers. Now, if only he can convince his mother to give him twenty pesos... It was harder than he thought. Andong is a story about pre-juvenile obsession, family dynamics and the real value of a hard-fought twenty pesos.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039363</url></doc>
