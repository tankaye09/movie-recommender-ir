<plot>Some people believe that children are the future and that no child should be left behind. But when the principal of Francis Drake High School hires his smart-aleck slacker friend to take over the gifted and accelerated class, some of the other teachers are worried that the future of these kids does not look very bright at all. Appearances are not everything in this comedy where one teacher's somewhat selfish passion for life makes an amazing impact on a group of students that goes well beyond anyone's expectations. Acclaimed actor Peter Dinklage (The Station Agent) creates a lovable curmudgeon in the tradition of Archie Bunker. It's a rich offbeat comedy that proves inspiration can come from the most unlikely sources, like teenagers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536599</url></doc>
