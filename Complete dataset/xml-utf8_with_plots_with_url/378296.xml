<plot>To describe a mother, you use words like, nurturing, loving and understanding. A mom is supposed to be perfect, but that is often far from the truth. Mother Superior explores the lives of mothers who are addicted to meth. Salt Lake City is third in the nation for meth use among women. This film brings light to another side of motherhood that most people don't see, even though it could be right under their nose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378296</url></doc>
