<plot>Rethna works hard to organize her fellow factory employees against the miserly, uncaring owner, Henry Burke. Then, realizing that she needs money to fight Burke, she begins an affair with his unscrupulous son Harry. After a year she breaks up with him to marry his kindly brother Walter, and so continues to use Burke funds to aid Burke employees. Walter truly loves Rethna, but when he finds out that she married him only for his money, he leaves her. Then, while she is at the factory pleading with Henry for better conditions, a fire breaks out. Walter rescues Rethna from the flames, and during her convalescence she discovers that she really does love him. She and Walter reconcile, and then, as a result of the fire, Henry decides to spare no expense in improving factory conditions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235826</url></doc>
