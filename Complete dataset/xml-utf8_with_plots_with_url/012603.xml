<plot>To many, a life of solidarity is the ultimate punishment. We define ourselves by our surroundings; and when someone doesn't comply and mould with our utopian perception, we give them a choice: Learn to blend or be shunned. However, there are the few who not only refuse to comply, but welcome a life of exile. A Loss for Words, peers into the world of Gerald Graham. Gerald's ideal life is that of a recluse, however impractical that may be. Unable to escape completely, he finds himself imprisoned in a life of mediocrity. This brings him face to face with the society he wishes to leave, causing at least part of him to envy a way of life that by now seems forever unattainable. The social limbo Gerald encounters drives him to schizophrenia. What he can't have he will create; and what threatens his creation he will eliminate. Unfortunately for Gerald, he learns his biggest threat is himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012603</url></doc>
