<plot>The vampire population has become virtually extinct, except for four female vampires. Through time, they have lost the ability to turn victims into vampires and have become almost fully human, yet still have the need to feed and satisfy their vampire urges. As a result, they must integrate into society and hunt as a team to survive. Due to their integration, they start to express human feelings of love and companionship. But there may be a way to save their species. With the help of a mad scientist, they will try to procreate with humans to keep the species alive and restore their past prowess. However, the strong love and companionship they've developed may force them to stay as mortal humans, instead of going back to being immortal vampires.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569731</url></doc>
