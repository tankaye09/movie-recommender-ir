<plot>Two families, both alike in dignity, in our fair city, where we lay our scene. One family is just past its prime, the other has recently cashed in. Fate throws the two together in the land's most prestigious cemetery on the very same day. Natasha, the last remaining Watsonstein-Tudor, mourns the death of her failed-poet brother Casper - as well as any spending power she once had. Nick mourns the death of his rags-to-riches grandfather - as well as any hope he once had that his villainous father Roger would just lay off. Roger, dissatisfied with his family's plot, covets the imposing Watsonstein-Tudor mausoleum and triggers a surprising turn of events when he enlists his son to buy it from Natasha. Little does he know the negotiations are a matter of life and death - for the kids.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435861</url></doc>
