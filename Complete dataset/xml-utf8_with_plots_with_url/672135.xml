<plot>Arjun Singh is a responsible and dedicated police officer. His efforts to fight corruption and terrorism are all in vain when he keeps on running into obstacles created by his superior officers, including DSP Chautala, and influential people like Sharad Patil, Shah Alam, and Swami Satyavadhi. When he asks a known terrorist and childhood friend, Iqbal Khan, to testify in court, in order to turn the tables against forces of oppression and corruption, he is instead put on the defensive when Iqbal turns against him, and speaks out in favor of the Muslim religious leader, Shah Alam, and the Hindu religious leader, Swami Satyavadhi, who are bent upon making both the religious groups fight and kill each other, while they take advantage of the situation, and rake in their profits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?672135</url></doc>
