<plot>After the passing of his parents, Vijay Sarnaik lives a wealthy lifestyle. During the day he is just like any other businessman, but at night he dons the guise of a homeless drunk, and goes in search of his mentally challenged brother, Mandar, who has been missing for last over 8 years. One night, Vijay comes to the rescue of a woman named Asha, and brings her home to live with him. Shortly thereafter he is assaulted by unknown men, and left on the sidewalk. When he regains his senses, he finds Mandar asleep on the sidewalk next to him. He immediately takes Mandar home, and gets him medically checked. Shortly thereafter, Mandar is injured, Vijay gets him admitted, and gets him treated. This time Mandar regains his senses as well as his memory - and plots with Vijay's servants and others to declare Vijay mentally unstable so that he could avenge all the wrongs that were inflicted on him during childhood, as well as to take over the entire wealth and estate. Mandar does succeed in his venture, but finds that he has an unknown enemy who he must deal with also.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?493863</url></doc>
