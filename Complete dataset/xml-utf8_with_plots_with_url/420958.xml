<plot>Both established and emerging Palestinian filmmakers were invited to come together in a project that would reflect the "mood" of Summer 2006 in Palestine. Using one shot, filmmakers were asked to tell their stories in three minutes or less. Despite the fact that Palestinians have been dispersed across the globe, with the majority of them being refugees, "Summer 2006, Palestine",initiated by the Palestinian Filmmakers' Collective, was limited to filmmakers living in Palestine. The result is a unique collection of short films from across Palestine, delving into the personal, the political, and the poetic - the spirit of a people struggling for freedom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420958</url></doc>
