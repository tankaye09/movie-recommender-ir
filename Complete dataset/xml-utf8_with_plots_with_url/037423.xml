<plot>The Indians are superstitious. They think that if they allow their pictures to be taken that they will die shortly after. This old squaw refuses to have her picture taken. She covers her head with a black shawl and staggers past the camera.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037423</url></doc>
