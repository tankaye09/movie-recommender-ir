<plot>PARANO is the story of one man who was abducted from his bedroom by extra-terrestrial beings during the first hour of 1996. Ariel Semmel, an Israeli-born cinematographer known for his visually intense work, was at the peak of his career and directing his first feature film starring his girlfriend. Eleven minutes after their New Year's toast, the couple were lying naked in bed, chatting and smoking a cigarette. Then, four aliens appeared and abducted them. The event lasted 3 days and changed their lives forever. In PARANO, the world's leading UFO investigators disclose new facts about the yet unsolved mystery of the Roswell crash and alien implants are surgically removed from a 72 year-old abductee's body.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423358</url></doc>
