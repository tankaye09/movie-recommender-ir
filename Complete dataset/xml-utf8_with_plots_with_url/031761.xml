<plot>Showing the feeding of the ducks, as well as their greed. They devour the food so rapidly that they become choked. They run to the water troughs and immediately back to the food, and keep running back and forth continually and promiscuously. This is a very lively and interesting picture, perfect photographically and instructive from beginning to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031761</url></doc>
