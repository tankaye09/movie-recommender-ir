<plot>It's a tough day for Adam Westbury (Tim Carr), he's having problems at work, problems with his health, problems with his relationship. To top it all off, he's feeling left out, because everyone in his world speaks in rhyme except for him. Feeling alienated and dejected, he talks to a quirky bartender, Mortimer Kushnick (Mike McGrath) who has a joke for everything. Adam ventures off to have a very bad day, however six feet behind him, Mortimer is there, cracking jokes and trying to cheer him up. "A deeper shade of soul" is a comedy about alienation, rejection, and the hope, that just maybe, a bad day can always get better.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009571</url></doc>
