<plot>"In 1990, I was sent as an Army cameraman to gather video testimony from elite combat soldiers stationed in Nablus. The film was supposed to be a moral booster for the troops, but when I turned on the camera, things were said that would later endanger all of us and change our lives forever." (Yariv Horowitz, director) In this film, for the first time, Israeli combat soldiers speak of their traumatic experiences in the first Intifada, revealing the deep moral and psychological scars left by their involvement in acts of extreme violence against the Palestinian population. The film combines explosive interviews with soldiers in Nablus in 1991, as well as their perspective ten years later.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025440</url></doc>
