<plot>Bluto's in the Army; he tries to sneak off base, but can't. Popeye passes by, on the way to a date with Olive; Bluto invites him in, then swaps uniforms (yes, they fit very badly). Popeye ends up in a tank drill, which he does very badly, driving through a house, into a pond, and ultimately falling off a cliff. That's it, it's time for the spinach, and a run for it; he manages to outrun or out maneuver all the other tanks and arrives at Olive's just as Bluto is walking out with her (oddly enough, even though the date with Olive is the motivation for the whole plot, she has only one line). The boys fight in the tank and Popeye swaps uniforms back again, just as the tank boys catch up; that gets Bluto blamed for all of Popeye's hijinks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357012</url></doc>
