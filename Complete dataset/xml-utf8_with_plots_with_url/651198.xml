<plot>Bugs Bunny is enjoying his morning shower under a waterfall, singing "April Showers," when the water flow gets cut off. Bugs, thinking at first beavers are responsible, he climbs up the cliff to investigate. He meets Black Jacque Shellac, a ruthless lumberjack who wants to control the water supply. Bugs tricks the French-accented Jacque into removing a tiny rock in the dam to dislodge it. Jacque builds more dams, and prepares for what he thinks is the rabbit pulling more tricks; but of course Jacque and his dams get the worst end of a real shark and a barge full of dynamite. Certain Bugs will make more attempts to destroy his dam, the villainous Jacque fires his rifle at the waterfalls but winds up wrecking the rabbit's record player. Jacque builds "the perfect dam," one made of steel, but this time, the rabbit fights back with a series of his own. Using a cannon, Jacque proceeds to destroy them all, but his final attempt to destroy Grand Cooler Dam (thinking it's Bugs') ends with Jacque in the custody of the federal authorities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651198</url></doc>
