<plot>Conner's luck takes a turn for the worse when he stops for a bite to eat at the Spicy Wonton, a questionable Chinese restaurant at best. The atmosphere is creepy, the employees are odd, and the food is sub-par. All seems normal unitl he realizes that the waitress wants to tell him something. From then on Conner holds his fortune in his hands. Through twists and turns he'll come to realize one thing and one thing only... ...he should've ate the special.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?371812</url></doc>
