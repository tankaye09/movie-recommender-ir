<plot>The picture is in two parts. The first shows the market-man arriving in a kitchen with a basket of crabs. In removing the crabs the cook has her finger pinched, and in anger tells the small boy to take them away. The second scene shows a young man coming into his room in a sad state of inebriation. He goes into an adjoining room to disrobe, and while he is there engaged the small boy puts the crab into his bed. The young man returns, crawls into bed, but soon jumps out in great fright with crabs clinging all over him, making a very ludicrous scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008258</url></doc>
