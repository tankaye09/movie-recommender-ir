<plot>It takes place on near-future Earth, and it's highly relevant to current global social-political circumstances. Citizen Siege was conceived as game and movie, as a fully fleshed-out game design and a fully fleshed-out story concept for a motion picture at the same time. It's a mature-themed sci-fi action thriller. It's a world gone slightly awry. In this near future, the world is governed by corporatism. And within this world, an expatriate returns home to find himself in a certain state where he has been legally repossessed due to credit rackets run by the corporatism-ruled world. A 1984 for the 21st century. It will be entirely 3-D CG animation. Condensed from Gamespot.com interview by Emma Boyes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107325</url></doc>
