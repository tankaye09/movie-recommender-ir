<plot>Old House Has Joy is a story about the love between Ji Xiang and Xiao Peng. After some obstacles, the couple finally manages to be together, only to realise that Ji Xiang is Xiao Peng's cousin, therefore making them relatives and unable to wed. Running alongside is the story of the couple's Grandparents, with Alec and Vicki taking the roles of that love couple. The series has many great Alec and Vicki moments (as it intended to), but lacks a depthful storyline. Filmed at the same time as Huan Zhu Ge Ge II, Old House Has Joy was mainly intended to further the popularity of the Alec Su, Vicki Zhao pairing, which it did fantastically.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319143</url></doc>
