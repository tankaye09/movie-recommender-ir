<plot>Featherhead is a poignant tale of a lifelong love that is tested to the limit. As John¹s wife¹s Alzheimer¹s progresses he is barely able to cope and becomes visibly aggressive. Arathi, an elderly Asian neighbour who sees the situation decaying from across the fence must decide if she should intervene. Cultures collide as the situation becomes even more tragic. Stunningly filmed by internationally renowned cinematographer, Brian Tufano (DP of Billy Elliot, East is East, and Trainspotting), the film leaves you with a unique empathy and understanding of a subject that is rarely discussed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191497</url></doc>
