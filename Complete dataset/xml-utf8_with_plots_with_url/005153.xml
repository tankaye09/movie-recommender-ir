<plot>In the lower east side of New York City the entire graduating high school class of forty-five seniors collaborated to produce a documentary addressing fatherlessness. Featured in this documentary are four stories that illustrate the impact the presence or absence a father has on family members and community. One teen female who was never reared by her father focuses on a strong bond with her mother, while another revels in a solid relationship with her father. A fully committed teen father stands the test of time at the side of his son and daughter, while a teen male whose father left him when he was three years old lauds the relationship with his mother and an uncle who played a strong male role model in his life. An introspective look by young people on what defines a responsible father necessary to make a positive difference in his child's life.</plot><plot>In the lower east side of New York City the entire graduating high school class of forty-five seniors collaborated to produce a documentary addressing fatherlessness.
