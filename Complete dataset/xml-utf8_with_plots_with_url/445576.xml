<plot>Three days before graduation, several alumni from Stansbury, an elite boarding school that produces the nation's leaders through strict education and medical enhancement, are murdered. COOLEY, a student on scholarship who doesn't subscribe to the school's rules and politics is implicated in the murders. GOLDSMITH, the formidable straight-laced valedictorian, takes responsibility for investigating Cooley. The pair eventually become reluctant allies, working together to solve the murders. They soon find their lives endangered, as they begin to unravel the cabal behind the murders, uncovering a thrilling conspiracy that reaches far beyond the confines of their school.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445576</url></doc>
