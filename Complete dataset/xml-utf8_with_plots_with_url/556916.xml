<plot>Shows a couple of boys shooting craps on the street. Reuben comes along with a handbag and umbrella. He stops to look and his hand falls to his side with a cigar between his fingers. The boys smoke nearly all of the cigar before being discovered. When he awakes he strikes right and left at the urchins. They upset him on the sidewalk and steal his bag and umbrella. A policeman hustles Reuben off to the lockup but not before Reuben gives him a good fight. This is a lively and most amusing subject and is bound to provoke an unusual amount of laughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556916</url></doc>
