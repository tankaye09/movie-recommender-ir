<plot>Jesus is shown here on the moment where, having gone to fast and pray, he appears at the beginning of the scene in prayer. Satan appears and with a diabolical look asks Jesus to fall down and worship him. Christ points upward then turns to Satan and motions him to get hence. An animated dialogue ensues and Jesus triumphs over Satan, who turns and skulks away.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425378</url></doc>
