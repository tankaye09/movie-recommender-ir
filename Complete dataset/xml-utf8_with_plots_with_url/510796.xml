<plot>This wet n' wild sequel to the 2001 Sea-Doo racing game Splashdown trades in real world locations for elaborate, imaginative theme-park inspired courses. Blast past Spanish galleons and dodge dangerous booby traps in Cannonball Cove, unleash a horde of ghosts upon a sleepy village in Blackwater Castle, discover the secret of a jungle island populated with dinosaurs in Dino Dominion, and 5 more incredible adventures! Also includes 12 insane indoor stadium tracks, 5 death-defying freestyle courses, and a host of open-water Technical Time Trials.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510796</url></doc>
