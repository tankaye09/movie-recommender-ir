<plot>An air stewardess for Olympic Airlines, Chloe, during her brief stay in Rome, meets a Greek shipowner, Stefanos, from whom she hides her real identity, pretending she is a rich girl. During the return flight to Athens, she discovers that Stefanos is among the passengers going to Greece - in order to help his sister Martha Dypone on an adoption issue that has been bothering her for quite some time. The charade continues even aboard the plane with the help of Chloe's colleagues. Ingenuous lies on both sides create plenty of comedy and misunderstandings, but, in the end, both of them manage to preserve their emotional integrity, thanks to the attitude of the orphan Petris, who doesn't want to be adopted by a wealthy French woman. Petris lives next door to Chloe and seeks refuge in her house. Chloe, unaware of the fact that Dypon is Stefanos' sister, decides to do the right thing and visits her, and the entire matter of the adoption is settled to the satisfaction of all concerned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024539</url></doc>
