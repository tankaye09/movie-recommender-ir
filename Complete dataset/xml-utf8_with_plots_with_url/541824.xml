<plot>Discover the joy of movement and the beauty of dance with the first program in this series by Instructor Melissa Lowe. The Ballet Workout will help you condition, shape and tone your body. Melissa will not only help you create the body you have always wanted, but will also help you gain an overall sense of well being. The workout has been divided into two levels. Level 1 is designed for those with little or not ballet experience. For Level II previous ballet experience is helpful but not necessary. Success on both workout levels lies in performing the exercises in the correct position and with the correct posture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541824</url></doc>
