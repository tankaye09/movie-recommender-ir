<plot>Nobody knows his true name, but everybody knows he is the Major, and that when he wants something, he gets it. Under his beaten officer cap, the retired officer has an ingenious brain, so he plans everything with strategy and long range vision. Two handicaps not even the Major could foresee. The first was the insidious plans of revenge by his arch-enemy Hawk-Eye, now known as the One-Eyed - after the major blinded him in their first encounter. The second was the capacity of doing mischief of the half-caste Mexican Lucky, whose life the Major saved when he was going to be hanged for his crimes - out of piety, and because Lucky is holding to half of the treasure map hidden into an abandoned gold mine somewhere. Together, and sometimes tactically separate, both men strive to attain their goals, while Hawk-Eye tries to get his hands on both halves of the map. The pair can trust no one, men or women alike, not even each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?605583</url></doc>
