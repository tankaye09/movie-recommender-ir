<plot>The intense and out of ordinary life of Carlo Petrini, professional football player of the seventies. In 1968, at the age of 19, he had the first terrible experience with doping, just few months before his debut in Serie A, with Milan Club. After a brief recollection of his football career, Petrini talks about the first big scandal in Italian "Serie A": the illegal bets and his personal involvement in two fixed matches; Juventus Club scams to avoid any disciplinary action; the political movements that led to a long suspension that virtually ended his career. Submersed by debts with dangerous mobsters he flees abroad, until the tragedy that changed his life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?098242</url></doc>
