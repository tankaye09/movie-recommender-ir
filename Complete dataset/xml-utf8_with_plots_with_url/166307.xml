<plot>Charley invents a machine that turns ordinary, breakable eggs into rubbery, unbreakable ones for transport. He builds a Rube Goldberg contraption of parts stolen from his neighbors. Rival egg companies want his invention, one of them stooping to sabotage to get it. Charley falls in love with the daughter of the president of one of the companies. When the Egg Export Company comes to inspect the machine, Charley has to find eggs for it. He puts a basket of eggs on top of the engine of his Model T Ford. When he opens it, the eggs have hatched into little Model Ts. Eventually, Charley proves the value of his invention to his beloved's father and wins her hand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166307</url></doc>
