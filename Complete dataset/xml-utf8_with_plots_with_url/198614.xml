<plot>"Flying Over Cuba" is a documentary film aiming to illuminate the dangers of reckless driving. The film examines this seemingly insignificant, but recurring problem along Cuba Road in Long Grove Illinois, through a recent tragedy involving Brett Karlin. As a passenger of a vehicle that was traveling at high speeds on Cuba Road, Brett was only eighteen years old when his young life was cut short in early August. "Flying Over Cuba" addresses the consequences of reckless driving by exploring the harrowing aftermath of Brett's death. The film provides personal interviews with the victim's family and friends, community members, and the driver of the vehicle. It is through the culmination of these interviews that "Flying Over Cuba" seeks to educate people about the dangers of reckless driving and how it can be prevented. The film portrays the importance of cautious driving and the responsibility that must be taken when getting behind a wheel through the story of Brett Karlin.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198614</url></doc>
