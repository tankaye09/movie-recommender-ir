<plot>Roald Graves is a writer/director famous for his four decades of gory, nail biting horror films. When he suffers a mild heart attack, his doctor's advice is to get out of his own head for awhile and take a vacation. Roald leaves the city and drives upstate for some peace and quiet, when a strange girl, Audrey Fortier, runs in front of his car from the woods claiming to have witnessed a murder. Roald offers to drive Audrey into town where there is a police station, not expecting that the next few terrifying hours ahead of him will be just like something out of one of his own horror movies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075492</url></doc>
