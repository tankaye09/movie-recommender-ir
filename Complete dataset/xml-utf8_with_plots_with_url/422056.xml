<plot>In this picture we secured a most perfect panoramic scene of the war vessels, official tugs and excursion steamers starting for home immediately after the race. The boats were all under full speed and passed closed to our Committee boat for the purpose of reading the official figures. We were thus enabled to secure a most perfect and realistic marine view. The revenue cutters "Gresham" and "Seminole," followed by the revenue cutter tender "Scout," the steam yachts "Niagara" and "Corsair," the Yacht Club Committee tugs, five in number, each churn the water into a seething mass of foam. They are closely followed by the excursion fleet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422056</url></doc>
