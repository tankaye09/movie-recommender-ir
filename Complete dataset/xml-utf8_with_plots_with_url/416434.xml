<plot>Siar, Alican and the boys from Osdorfer Born tell their story. Being a member of the ghetto provides them with a sense of identity and creates a common bond between them. But the boys also have doubts. In truth, most of them know that it is a strange world they live in, where a criminal counts more than someone who goes to school.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?416434</url></doc>
