<plot>A collection of sketches detailing hilarious urban adventures only found in da hood! "Comedy Only in Da Hood, Volume 1," dares to ask questions like "If Eddie Murphy never made it out of da' hood, what would he be doing?" We'll also get another first hand peek into the confidential legal files of none other than the well respected (and feared) Captain Child Support Man! You'll join him as he saves the day for countless Mother's and children, bringing dead beat Dad's to justice; he doesn't want all your money, he just wants what you owe!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111843</url></doc>
