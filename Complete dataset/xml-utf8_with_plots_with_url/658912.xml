<plot>A young man, listening to music alone in his apartment, hears a knock at his door. He opens it, but no one is there. Inside the apartment, he notices a cardboard box, picks it up, and runs down the hall, out the front door, and through city streets. He puts on his glasses. He reaches an alley and stands observing, somewhat bewildered. Someone approaches. The journey continues; he notices flowers. Will the box be opened? Will he connect with anyone?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658912</url></doc>
