<plot>Set during W.W.II, the story follows a brash Canadian pilot, Vince Pavelon (Vince Salonia), who serves with the famed Royal Air Force. In addition to facing his enemies in the air, however, Vince also has to cope with the haunting dreams of his own death. While on a routine sortie, Vince's squadron gets ambushed by German fighters. In the ensuing scramble, despite a gallant effort, Vince's plane is severely damaged. Vince is forced to an emergency landing. What is worse, he finds himself in the skies above the Nazi-occupied France. Vince manages to land, but his plane is a wreck and his body feels like one. He immediately goes on the run, as the Germans are right on his heels. He is determined not to be taken a prisoner and looks desperately for a soul that would shelter him. When a local turns down his plea for help, Vince sees with his own eyes the effect of living under the iron fist of Nazi occupation. Vince marches on. As his blood and strength drain, he stumbles onto a lonely house. He observes the household closely, but does not see anyone. Out of time and options, Vince approaches the house and puts his life in the hands of its inhabitants, whoever they might be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629224</url></doc>
