<plot>Tone, an older man, drives from Germany to visit his son Grega and his daughter-in-law Masha. Though nobody talks about it, something horrible has happened. In attempt to ease their pain for a moment, Tone takes the young couple out for an ice-cream and so begins their drive around the countryside. On the road, Grega and Masha experience sudden changes of mood. They get aggressive, deeply saddened, suddenly cheerful, nervous, depressed... They are together but each on their own. And the gap between them is growing. Meanwhile, Tone drives them further away from home but no further from what has happened.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396853</url></doc>
