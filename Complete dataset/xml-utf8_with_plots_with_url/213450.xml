<plot>Ben Chaney was 11 when his brother James and two white civil rights workers from New York were murdered by a mob of Klansmen for registering Blacks voters in Mississippi in 1964. For 40 years the State failed to prosecute these killers even though they bragged openly about what they did. GET ON BOARD tells the story of Ben's quest for justice and his commitment to his brother's legacy. In 2004, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his brother's death, Ben takes a group of young volunteers on a Freedom Bus Ride from New York to Mississippi to register voters, and in the process, teaches them the price of freedom, the importance of voting and how one person can make a difference. The film follows four Freedom Riders, two blacks and two whites, whose lives are forever changed by the experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213450</url></doc>
