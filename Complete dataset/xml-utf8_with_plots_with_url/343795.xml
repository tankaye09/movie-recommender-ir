<plot>The near death Stigmatic experience of Danielle Seraphin's daughter forces her to question everything in her life. Stuck in the middle of the prairies is the Metis community of St. Pierre-Jolys Manitoba, its deeply Catholic citizens obsessive about sin, yet myopically unaware of imperfections about to flourish and expose themselves behind the 63 windmills guarding the community. The winds of change begin as a rebel biker blows into town on his Harley, returning after many years to fix the family homestead and conceal a marijuana grow op. And a tragic, timeless love story unfolds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343795</url></doc>
