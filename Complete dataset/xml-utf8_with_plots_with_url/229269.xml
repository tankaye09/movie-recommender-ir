<plot>Unhappy at the manner in which things on Earth have regressed to, God issues instructions for the complete destruction of mankind and Earth, as love, sacrifice, kindess and compassion are no longer present. Three heavenly angels, Om, Namah, &amp; Shiva, respectfully request God to grant them a period of a week so that they can get an example of love, sacrifice, compassion, and kindness, in order to enable God to reconsider his instructions, to which God agrees, and permits the three angels to visit Earth, on the condition that they will not be visible to any humans, nor will they use their heavenly powers to assist any human in any manner whatsoever. The question remains, that in this Kal Yug (Dark Age) will the angels ever come across a compassionate, and loving human being, who is capable of sacrifice, in such short period of time?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229269</url></doc>
