<plot>"Two nuns take a bath, then meet a sailor on the Staten Island Ferry" - Piero Heliczer "Among all the new movies (it has been quiet lately on the underground scene) Piero Heliczer's Dirt touched me most deeply. Its beauty is very personal and lyrical. And every frame of it is cinema. I can do not justice to this beautiful work in one paragraph. It was shot on 8mm and much of its beauty and its cinema come from 8mm properities of camera and film. It is all motion. Together with Brakhage's Songs, Branaman's abstractions and Ken Jackob's not yet released work, Heliczer's Dirt is one of the four works that use 8mm film properly and for art's sake" - Jonas Mekas, Village Voice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151099</url></doc>
