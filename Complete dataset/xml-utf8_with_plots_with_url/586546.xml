<plot>Marcus Welby is back, and he has a few problems. First he is trying to bridge the gap between an old friend of his who gave up practicing medicine in favor of being the hospital administrator, and his son who is now a doctor and who is currently treating a woman who has kidney problems. And the hospital that he has serving faithfully for years is considering letting some of their elderly staff members go and Mark is on top of the list.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586546</url></doc>
