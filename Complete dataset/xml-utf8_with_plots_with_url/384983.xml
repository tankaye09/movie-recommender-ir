<plot>"My Tale of Two Cities" is a funny and heartfelt movie that has been called a "Mr. Rogers &amp; Me" as it tells the comeback story of "St. Elmo's Fire" screenwriter Carl Kurlander who moved back to the real-life "Mister Rogers Neighborhood" only to find both himself and his hometown of Pittsburgh in mid-life crisis. In an attempt to help his hometown while exploring with honesty and humor whether you can go home again, Kurlander asks his neighbors, from the famous (Steeler Franco Harris and Teresa Heinz Kerry) to his old gym teacher and the girl who inspired "St. Elmo's Fire", how this once great industrial giant which built America with its steel, conquered polio, and invented everything from aluminum to The Big Mac, can reinvent itself for a new age. With many neighborhoods across America wondering the same question these days, "My Tale of Two Cities" is a charming, engaging feel-good film that proves "it's never too late to come back!" and that the whole world really is "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384983</url></doc>
