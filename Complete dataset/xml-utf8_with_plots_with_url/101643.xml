<plot>"Chemmeen", renowned Malayalam novel by Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai has been translated into more than thirty languages. The theme of the novel is a myth among the fishermen communities along the coastal Kerala State in the Southern India. The myth is about chastity. If the married fisherwoman was infidel when her husband was in the sea, the Sea Goddess ('Kadalamma' literally means Mother Sea)the Goddess wouls consume him. It is to perpetuate this myth that Thakazhi wrote this beautiful novel. The film version is somewhat successful with endearing acting performances by Kottarakkara Sreedharan Nair (Chemban Kunju), Sheela (Karuthamma), Sthyan (Palani) and Adoor Bhavani (Chakki, Chemban Kunj's wife).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101643</url></doc>
