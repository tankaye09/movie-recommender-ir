<plot>Jack is a young successful suburban drug dealer who seems to have it all: a lucrative business, a beautiful wife, and Marty, his loyal life-long friend. When an old friend betrays Jack in a drug deal, Jack explodes in a violent rage. Even though Jack's business is lucrative, the world of drug dealing is still relatively new to Jack, creating a sense of unease and discomfort in his life. With his facade of control cracked, Jack's mounting distrust of his newly wed wife drives him to concoct a plan to test her loyalty. His paranoia approaching madness, Jack sets his twisted plan into action, threatening to destroy not only everything he loves, but himself as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152239</url></doc>
