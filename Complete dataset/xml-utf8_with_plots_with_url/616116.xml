<plot>This documentary examines one of the more controversial issues in Islam today, the Hijab - the Islamic dress code for women. It answers a fundamental question: Is the Hijab a form of oppression or a woman's expression of faith? Through sharing their views and personal experiences, several Muslim Women living in the United States help us understand the various attitudes towards the Hijab and the compelling arguments of the underlying issues from morality, modesty and faith to oppression and a woman's right to choose. One story involves Merve Kavakci, the first veiled woman to become a member of the Turkish Parliament and her political struggle to maintain her belief and identity in a secular political system.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?616116</url></doc>
