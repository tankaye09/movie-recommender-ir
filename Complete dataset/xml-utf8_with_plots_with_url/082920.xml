<plot>Would it surprise you that "One in three people live on less then one dollar a day." or that "26 million children died today due to poverty."? Maybe... But what is surprising is that we don't hear about the world's most pressing issues on TV. Networks are more concerned with "The Real World" than with the real world! You don't have to be an actor to know the profound effect television has on America's youth. Chris Bashinelli, an actor, decided to head to Tanzania in 2007 to answer the question, "Can TV change the world?". "Bridge the Gap: Tanzania" documents his experience during this month-long adventure. The documentary is an in-depth look at how important understanding culture is to the development of any nation. By immersing himself in Tanzanian culture, Chris gives voice to teenagers in overlooked parts of the world. Rather than saying, "Here's what you need," the pilot says, "let's build a plan together." Despite what one expects to see, "Bridge the Gap" shows an overlooked side of Africa. No violence, no depressed faces and no children starving in the streets. There are significant challenges Tanzania faces, but we explore these issues in an informative way to evoke change, not pity. Through interviews with leading experts, including the UN Ambassador to Tanzania, viewers are educated and empowered, rather than left saddened and unable to help. The excitement happens when a kid from Brooklyn is thrown into the world of rural Africa! From catching chickens with the Masai, to conversations with a Black Panther, "Bridge the Gap: Tanzania" inspires us to better our world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082920</url></doc>
