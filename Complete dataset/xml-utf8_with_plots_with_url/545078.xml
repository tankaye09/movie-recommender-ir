Mike, an American film student, reluctantly travels to Bombay, India to assist a graduate student, Rahul, in the making of a Bollywood movie. Mike initially finds it challenging to adapt, but as the magic of Bollywood begins to win him over, he finds himself falling in love with the lead actress Preeti. When Rahul's parents announce an arranged marriage between Rahul and Preeti, this news threatens Mike's enchanting new life.
