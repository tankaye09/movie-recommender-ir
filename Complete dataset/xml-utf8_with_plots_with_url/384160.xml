<plot>Lyle Licketti never ever does his homework. Whether it is an alien who stole it or a pet dinosaur...he'll weave a tall tale about how he couldn't do his homework. His third grad teacher, Mrs. Cee, tired of his lies, won't tolerate his shenanigans today. Today is test day. She wants him to take his quiz, quietly. Last night, Lyle's homework ate his dog. Now, the homework is after him and no one at school will listen to his story (performed in rhyme). Will Lyle be able to persuade his classmates and Mrs. Cee before it's too late?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384160</url></doc>
