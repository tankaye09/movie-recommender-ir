<plot>This scene opens with a view of a stage setting and private box. After Miss Dolly Lightfoot has finished a clever dance, a card is placed upon the stage announcing an extra turn. An Italian vocalist appears and starts to sing. He is received with a shower of missiles, to which he pays no attention, until he is finally floored. He rushes from the stage and reappears with an umbrella for protection. He defiantly continues to sing. Two stage hands rush from the wings, seize him, and drag him from the stage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556140</url></doc>
