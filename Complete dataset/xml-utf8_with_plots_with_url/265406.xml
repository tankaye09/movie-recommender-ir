<plot>The film explores a South Florida dance/theatre troupe of incest survivors who perform their stories of lost innocence and journey toward empowerment. As children, their bodies were violated. They were forced into silence and lived in shame. As adults, they regained their power through Innermotion. On stage, they share the events that kept them bound to chains of secrecy for too long. Produced over a span of four years, Innermotion--The Dance of Incest promises to take its audiences from deep levels of compassion to laughter and, ultimately, celebration. This film is the engaging story of people who dared to face their demons and transform them through healing into power.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?265406</url></doc>
