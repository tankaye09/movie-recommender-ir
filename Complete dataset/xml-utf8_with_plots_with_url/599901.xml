<plot>A look at H.G. Wells and specifically his novel, _The War of the Worlds_ and its influence on the future, and its initial intents. Included is a discussion of Wells's relationships with women, his participation in society and his part in the development of the United Nations, and a comparison of the novel to the two most famous adaptations, including new interview footage with Howard Koch, the writer of the radio script. Also addressed is some of Wells's more controversial writings, which would be utilized in the 20th Century as tracts advocating genocide, as well as quotes from the smae material to show that interpretation as wrong.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599901</url></doc>
