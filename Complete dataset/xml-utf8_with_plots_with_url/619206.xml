<plot>Man lying down to rest after a night at the club. He finds himself in prison, and as he attempts to escape through various doors and windows, a solid wall suddenly blocks the way. Devil appears, and, after having considerable fun torturing the victim, is caught. A fight ensues, and as the man is about to give the "old boy" a thrashing, he wakes up and finds himself pounding his pillow vigorously. After recovering from the effects of his dream, he settles down again for a very much needed rest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?619206</url></doc>
