<plot>Herbert Schwartz is one of LA's top notch psychiatrists, and though he can hardly articulate a single reasonable sentence, he will help our hero Al to get rid of his first and foremost problem: Al just can't connect to people. Wether it's his frustrated parents or a hysterical girlfriend or a fellow actress - they all can't deal with Al's little friend. His duck on his head.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575042</url></doc>
