<plot>This is one of the most ludicrous films ever shown. Three young [black men] are first seen eating "watermillion" and the fellow in the middle is seen to dive forward several times and bury his face in the watermelon of his companions. The three are finally joined by four others who attack the remains of the lucious fruit with a vengeance. Mr. Anthony Rastus Jackson, who also loves chicken, is the ringleader and manages to swipe all there is in sight. They wind up the affair by throwing the rind at each other and they wash their faces with it, and seem to enjoy it. This is really funny and exciting, the action is perfect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164859</url></doc>
