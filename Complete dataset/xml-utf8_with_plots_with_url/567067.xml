<plot>Rabbi Itche Kadoozy was in for a big surprise when his wacky neighbor Jonathan and pet Gefilte Fish moved into his basement. Despite (and sometimes due to) his shenanigans, Jonathan, the childish Jewish "everyman", helps Orthodox Rabbi Kadoozy to illuminate the lessons of the Torah in an approachable way. Together, Itche and Jonathan produce a weekly public access television show called "The Parshah Report". The Report, an interpretation of the week's Torah portion, blends Itche's knowledge (and frequent exasperation) with Jonathan's quirky adolescent humor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567067</url></doc>
