<plot>A loose and fancy-free youth, Yeh Tein-lin, never takes his life seriously until he comes across a young, female broadcaster, Kao Wen-ying, who works at a radio station. She teaches him the meaning of life and guides him to face the real world. The film shows the contrast between fast-paced city life and the tranquility of a small fishing town, associated with a yearning for a peaceful life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?669264</url></doc>
