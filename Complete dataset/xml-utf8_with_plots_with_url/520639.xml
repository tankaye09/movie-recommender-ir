<plot>What Playboy magazine was to the 1950's, SuicideGirls is to the new millennium: a revolutionary lifestyle brand that combines the DIY attitude of underground culture with a vibrant, sex-positive community. Now comes Suicide Girls: The First Tour, a DVD featuring the unique mix of punk and burlesque that made the SuicideGirls first national tour such a hit with audiences. Beyond the stage performances, this DVD follows the women along for an intimate behind-the-scenes look at life in the van, along with exclusive photo shoots, and behind-the-scenes antics like trying to set up a topless photo shoot on the streets of San Francisco at midnight. In 2004, the SuicideGirls traveled 9,000 miles around the country to perform 60 sold-out burlesque shows in 45 cities, and this DVD documents it all. Giving a goth attitude to the tradition peek-a-boo, the SuicideGirls are sexy, seductive and charming as well as chaotic and candid, with scenes from the live performances interspersed with intimate looks at the individual models.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520639</url></doc>
