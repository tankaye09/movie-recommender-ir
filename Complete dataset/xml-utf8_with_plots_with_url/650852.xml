<plot>This is one of the interesting scenes witnessed by all tourists who visit the West India Islands. As the steamers approach the harbor, the black boys swim out to meet them. Money is invariably thrown over by the passengers into the deep water, and the boys dive for it, sometimes going down to great depths but invariably bringing the coin to the surface with them, holding it up in their fingers to show that they secured it, then stowing it carefully away in their ears or mouth and watching intently for some more gelt. This picture is intensely interesting, as from forty to fifty boys are seen diving at one time. The picture was taken in the harbor at Kingston, Jamaica, which is the most interesting and picturesque port in the West India group.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650852</url></doc>
