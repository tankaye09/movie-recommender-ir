<plot>A happily married advertising executive who, after a near-death experience, wakes up to discover he has a new best friend, Dick. Dick appears as a real person on screen but is only seen and heard by Bob and the audience and is, in fact, Bob's penis talking to him - the voice in every man's head that appraises women continually. Dick takes over Bob's life and leads him astray from his secure marital existence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077228</url></doc>
