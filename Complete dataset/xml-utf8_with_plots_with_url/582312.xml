<plot>This was the "Hollywood Squares" host's first - and only - attempt at a variety show of his own; Peter Marshall was already an accomplished singer, which not too many people were aware of when this show premiered (he even made a few albums in the mid-to-late 1960's). In addition to a talk-show style format, there were musical numbers, some of which Mr. Marshall performed with resident singing group The Chapter Five, as well as comedy sketches with regulars Rod Gist and Denny Evans. Sadly, Mr. Marshall's series lasted only five months; it was certainly a pleasant way to end a Sunday evening (or Saturday, depending on when and where Mr. Marshall's series was shown as it was syndicated).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582312</url></doc>
