<plot>The Life and Times of Arthur Erickson examines the life of this enigmatic architect and pays tribute to his achievements as a non-conformist and iconoclast. In a career spanning 50 years, he has created an unparalleled body of work that includes hundreds of buildings, many of them inspired by and designed to complement the Canadian landscape. Fellow architects Bing Thom and Moshe Safdie as well as other colleagues and luminaries comment on the career and achievements of Erickson, who is one of a handful of living architects to receive the prestigious Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement from the American Institute of Architecture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570881</url></doc>
