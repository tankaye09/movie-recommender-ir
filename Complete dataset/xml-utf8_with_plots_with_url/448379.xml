<plot>PUP follows two out, gay, Christian leathermen - Master Skip and Pup Tim - as they prepare to compete in The Second International Puppy Contest (IPC), a leather title contest for human canines and their handlers. The documentary is the first to introduce puppy play - a fetish in which a human expresses the attributes of a canine, most often in relation to another human taking the position of pup handler, owner, trainer, etc. Warm, affectionate, and funny, the film reveals a rarely seen world. We follow Master Skip and Pup Tim through the IPC veterinary exam, where Tim is examined by the panel of judges in a private room, and then through the public portion of the contest, where the two perform before the judges and a large audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?448379</url></doc>
