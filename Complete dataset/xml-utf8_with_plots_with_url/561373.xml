<plot>Although an advertisement for this film appears in Motion Picture World on 17 January 1914, there is no reliable documentation that a film bearing this title was ever produced or distributed at this time. Most likely, the film was announced but never made or begun but never completed. It's also possible it was completed and then released at a later date under another title.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?561373</url></doc>
