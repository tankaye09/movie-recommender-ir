<plot>In Hong Kong, the serious, unsmiling Root runs his crippled mother's fishing boat with his uncle and cousin. He writes love letters daily to Yan, his friend since childhood who now lives in Canada. To help with the work, Root and his cousin go to the mainland and buy Lotus, an energetic pop-culture-loving young woman. She gradually draws out Root, and when his cousin assaults her for sex, Root comes to her defense, claiming that she is his woman. This surprises everyone. Root's mother, fearing to lose her son's devotion, informs the immigration authorities about Lotus, and she's sent back to the mainland. This prompts revelations and new resolve from Root.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227099</url></doc>
