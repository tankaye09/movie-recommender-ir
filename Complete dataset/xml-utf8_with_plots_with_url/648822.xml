<plot>The notion of what it is to be Latino is explored through a discourse of passionate statements and reflexive images by eight emerging Latino filmmakers, Adam Schlachter, Anthony Nardolillo, Carlos Gallardo, Fanny Veliz, Iris Almaraz, Katrina Elias, Ruben Obregon, and Shawna Baca, all having distinguished, diverse backgrounds. From where they were born, to where they grew up, to their favorite Latino dance styles, to their favorite Latino films, to exploring their dreams, desires, struggles, and passions, to individually defining what it is to make their own, personal films, and what they hope to achieve and influence through their films with their culture, audience, and self-identity. A lyrical and expressive juxtaposition of vignettes embraces the differences within their own ethnicity to define Latino as different colors from different places coming together. It further suggests indirectly that perhaps to be Latino is the same as to be a human being.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648822</url></doc>
