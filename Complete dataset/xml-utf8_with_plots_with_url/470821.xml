<plot>Imagine your life as a road. One lane consists of everything you need for a happy life. Family, friends, a stable job. Now imagine the other lane is full of dreams, wants and desires. Can you change lanes so easily? For Alex, life is an emotional struggle between what he wants to do with this life and what he must do with his life. He meets an elderly man named Earl who teaches him that the struggle that Alex faces is nothing more than an excuse to do nothing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470821</url></doc>
