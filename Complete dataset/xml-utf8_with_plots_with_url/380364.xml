<plot>Here we show "Carrie Nation" and her Hatchet Brigade demolishing a saloon. Bottles fly and beer kegs roll in all directions, and in one part of the scene the bartender is flung bodily into the street. The crusaders completely wreck the finrest saloon in the Kansas town, "The Senate," after which they attempt to retire, when an officers arrests Mrs. Nation, the crowd following. An excellent piece of photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380364</url></doc>
