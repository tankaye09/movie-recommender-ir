<plot>Judge Vishnu Sahai was brought up in an orphanage and has no knowledge of his family background nor of his religion. He is married to beautiful Mala, who he loves very much, and he has a loyal and trusting friend in Rajan. He is very much revered and respected in the city of Gorakhpur. One day he travels to Mussoorie to attend a case. He meets with a stranger, they share a table, then they play cards. After playing cards Vishnu passes out, and when he wakes he finds himself under arrest for the murder of one Dhanraj. Angered at this, he loudly voices his innocence, that he is a Judge. But he is told that his real name is Anil Kumar, the owner of a theater in Delhi, who had a dispute with a man named Dhanraj, and killed him. Shortly thereafter the Prosecuting Attorney informs the court that Dhanraj had died of a heart-attack, and as a result Vishnu is discharged. Anxious to go home to his wife and friend, he gets a shock when he is told that his body has been burnt beyond recognition in a car accident. Anxious to clear this misunderstanding, he returns home to Gorakhpur and finds that Mala is having an affair with Rajan. Devastated and heart-broken he rests on a bench at Gorakhpur Railway Station when a man named Johar approaches him, calls him Diwan Anil Kumar, and convinces him to travel with him to Delhi and his palatial home. In order to solve this riddle, Vishnu travels to Delhi, where he is welcomed at his estate by his staff and a woman named Meena. While attempting to solve the Anil Kumar mystery and how he was killed, he gets embroiled in another puzzle, when Meena calls by the name of Sunil. Watch as events unfold that will finally unravel the truth about Vishnu's identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?129880</url></doc>
