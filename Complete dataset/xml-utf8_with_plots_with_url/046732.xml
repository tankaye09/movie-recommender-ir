<plot>Here is an excellent picture showing how well the drivers and horses handle heavy artillery in India. A number of pieces of artillery are shown being driven between marks which are placed so close together that the wheels of the gun carriages can just pass between them without knocking them down. The action is very rapid, and only in few cases are the blocks, which are used for marking, knocked down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046732</url></doc>
