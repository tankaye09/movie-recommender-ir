<plot>Bud Rand, charged with the care of his kid brother Bud, accepts an offer to appear in Copeland's Wild West Show to ride a wild horse called "Mankiller." Dude, right-hand man to Copeland, resents Bud's attentions to the show's sharpshooter Mary Owens, and when they fight it out, Bud is the winner. Dude losens the cinch on "Mankiller", causing Bud to be trampled and have to stay back when the show moves on. Dude intercepts letters from Bud to Mary and Billy and tells them that Bud is a coward. Billy is taken ill and when Bud goes to see him,he learns the situation of him being called a coward. He returns to ride "Mankiller" and breaks him, regaining Billy's confidence and Mary's love, and routs Dude and his henchies. Songs were "Down in Union County", "The Old Chisholm Trail" and "Sal's Got a Wooden Leg."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422947</url></doc>
