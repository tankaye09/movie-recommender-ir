<plot>17-year-old boy genius Ben Scott has a mom from Hell, no love life to speak of, and only one summer to make things right. Desperate to escape his mother, Ben runs away from home and seeks refuge in a nearby mansion, bunking with a house sitter named Chet. The only other occupant of the house is Meagan Sherman, the most popular girl in history... and Ben's new obsession. But of course, she isn't into nerds, let alone runaway uber-geniuses, so all of Ben's romantic advances are for naught. So Ben does the only thing that comes naturally to him: He uses a precise combination of household products and scientific know-how to develop the world's first working love potion. A few complicated calculations later, Meagan is finally his. But too soon after the formula is administered, illusions are shattered, lust begins to fade, and Ben's wet dream becomes a nightmare that no one could ever predict. "The Chemical King" is a comedy about love, brilliant schemes, and humankind's everlasting problem: horrible moms.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548289</url></doc>
