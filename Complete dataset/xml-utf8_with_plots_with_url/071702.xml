<plot>Daniel is an innocent, 15 year old, Christian male. His girlfriend Linda, of the same age and religion, demands that they take their relationship to the next step: cunnilingus. Unfortunately, Daniel's overbearing mother has raised him to believe that "the next step" is a sin and will lead to pregnancy. Linda tells Daniel that everything is perfectly safe (and fine with Jesus), but his mother's influence is just as strong as Linda's. Now Daniel must choose to believe the lies his mother has taught him or take that next step.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?071702</url></doc>
