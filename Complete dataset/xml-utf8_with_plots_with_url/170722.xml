<plot>A woman returns home from work and finds a note: her husband has left her. Surprised, she reads and reads the letter. Suddenly, the electric appliances in the kitchen began to move by themselves. She doesn't know if this is really happening or if she is imagining it. A friend arrives to comfort her and she tries to explain what is happening, but in her attempt to console her, the friend doesn't notice and won't listen. Finally, the woman manages to prove that something is going on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?170722</url></doc>
