<plot>Father David Michaels is a respected priest who one day falls prey to a mysterious woman's advances and comes very close to breaking his sacred vows. Unbeknownst to him, this is all just an elaborate scheme orchestrated by crime boss Eddie Dimarco to expose Father Michaels' dark past. Eddie frames Father Michaels for a murder, blackmails him with explicit photos, and threatens the life of his head nun. Father Michaels could lose everything, but he is forced to keep quiet. Eddie's malevolence only reinforces the guilt that Father Michaels feels over an indiscretion that has haunted him all these years. But, Father Michaels is not the only person with a secret past. Could Eddie Dimarco's vendetta be aimed at the wrong person?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458544</url></doc>
