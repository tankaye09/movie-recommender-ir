<plot>Set in the Star Wars timeframe between Episode IV and Episode V, Jump to Lightspeed is the first expansion for the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing game set in the Star Wars universe. More than 15 different vehicles are available to you for space exploration and combat, including starfighters and transport ships, which can be used in conjunction with X-wings and TIE fighters -- and the Millennium Falcon! As the struggle between the Rebel Alliance and The Empire extends into space, you can choose which side they're on -- or risk death as a Privateer available for missions for either side. Whichever side you choose, over 100 new missions await, as you fly across nebulae, space junkyards and asteroid fields.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513697</url></doc>
