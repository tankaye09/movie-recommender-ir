<plot>Rayburn has family obligations: a young wife, a son...and the violent crime family that employs him. Devoted to both families, Rayburn is reluctant when he is sent on his first contract kill with his brutal mentor, James. Isolated in an unforgiving wilderness, the men find their identities jeopardized after the messy hit is photographed by a motion detection hunter's camera. Vulnerable, Rayburn anxiously waits near the camera with a simple objective: kill the owner and collect the incriminating evidence. But things take a surprising turn when Rayburn learns the owner of the camera is a completely different kind of killer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195949</url></doc>
