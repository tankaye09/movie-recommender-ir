<plot>They say we are products of our background. Sarah Dawson was dealt a savage blow during her childhood. Not that everything up until that point was perfect. But she had security. With that taken away, she learned from an early age how to survive on her own. Odette Barber is a very different animal. Born into a comfortable middle class family, the only child of business-minded parents. Odette grew up with ambition, attitude and a ruthless streak that would prevent anything stopping her climb to the very top. Through the eyes of documentary crews, we follow these two girls through a single night of their lives in London. Though at opposite ends of the social spectrum, they may have more in common than first appears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016881</url></doc>
