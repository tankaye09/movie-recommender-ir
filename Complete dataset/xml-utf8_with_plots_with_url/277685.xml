<plot>JO FM is a film about a radio DJ who is kidnapped by an obsessed fan. It is also a film about two women coming to terms with their perceived roles in the world. What motivates Tina, the obsessed fan, to kidnap Star, the idolized DJ, is that Star represents the way radio once served Tina. Tina doesn't understand why market place value has replaced public interest. Tina wants Star to make her one last tape, one tape to remind her of the way radio, society and her life once were. Ultimately, JO FM is about the shape of today's commodified and consolidated media industry and how it affects us on an individual basis.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?277685</url></doc>
