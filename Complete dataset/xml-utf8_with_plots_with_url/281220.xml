<plot>Mihir Shandilya is a multi-millionaire bachelor, who at a very young age is an icon of the new-aged India. A television channel invites celebrities for their programs, and Mihir is being interviewed. On being questioned on his potential life partner, Mihir confesses his love life on a record program that there is a woman in his life to whom he wants to propose marriage. The hosts respects his views and invites them for the show. Mihir, is on a business trip abroad, wants Julie to accept him as her husband and expects an affirmative answer once he is back. Julie is unnerved by the program, and want to be on the same program, and talk about herself to the viewers. She wants to confess that she is a prostitute, a fact that Mihir, and his family members are unaware of. Mihir was amused that his lover had confessed about her life so publicly, and after his initial indignation, had only one thing to say, 'If you truly love then set it free because if its meant to be it shall come back to you'. Julie finally finds her true love that is willing to stand by her under any circumstances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281220</url></doc>
