<plot>David D'Mello lives a middle-classed lifestyle in Bangalore along with his wife, Mary, and a son, Bunty, and is a jockey in the Bangalore Turf Club. He has a run-in with a wealthy stud farm owner, Gomango, who kills him. David's death also kills his widower friend, Balram, compelling his son, Bhima, to move in with Mary. She gives birth to a daughter, and makes a living sewing and stitching clothes, while Bunty and Bhima wash cars and do small chores. Years later both Bhima and Bunty have grown up, work on a stud farm, and look after a pony, Sikander. Bunty is in love with Jenny and wants to marry her, but her dad, William, will only give his blessings after Bunty accumulates some wealth. In order to get wealthy quickly both Bhima and Bunty decide to rob Gomango - and set off a chain of events that will endanger and change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168364</url></doc>
