<plot>Drew is an aspiring producer from a small Midwestern city, currently residing in the South. He is fresh out of college with a degree in Music, but only a general labor job to show for it. His cousin, Lance, is a hustler from Drew's hometown, seeking to get a new lease on life and follow in his cousin's footsteps. Through one of his many connections, Lance arranges the opportunity that Drew has been thirsting for: an all-access, VIP night with some of the biggest movers and shakers in the music industry. However, there are two things standing in the way of Drew's dream evening: his company's attendance policy which won't allow him to miss work, and his overbearing, insensitive, military-minded supervisor who is determined to uphold that policy. After telling his boss that he has to attend a funeral, Drew's bluff is called and he is forced to go to the funeral to attain proof that he attended, or risk losing his job. While at the funeral, he is swept off his feet by Terricka, the niece of the deceased man, and also mistaken for someone else by Parkway, a young thug who has unfinished business with the deceased man and now thinks Drew is the man who can settle it. After being confronted and threatened by Parkway, Drew realizes that Terricka is the missing link that can help him find what Parkway is looking for and perhaps what he is looking for in the process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206833</url></doc>
