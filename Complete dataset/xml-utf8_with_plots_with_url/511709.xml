<plot>At the opening of the scene a painter is busy at work on a park bench. As he finishes he puts up a sign "Fresh Paint." A near sighted old gentleman comes in, sits down on the bench, takes out his spectacles and after carefully wiping them reads the sign. He jumps up immediately but his coat and trousers are covered with fresh paint. This is a hit picture and always gets a hearty laugh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511709</url></doc>
