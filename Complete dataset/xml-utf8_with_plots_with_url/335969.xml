<plot>Three Geordie lads are on a camping trip in the forest. As they mess around with the car and beers a pair of spacecrafts many thousands of miles out in space hit a meteor storm. One of the craft crashes on Earth where the pilot is found, dead, by the lads. When they start messing around with the alien's weapons and gadgets they accidentally launch a flare into space. They continue to mess around; unaware that the other craft has pinpointed his companion's location.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335969</url></doc>
