<plot>This picture shows just what its name implies, a circus fording a stream. The immense elephants and camels are seen drawing heavy circus wagons through a shallow stream. This picture is decidedly more interesting than an ordinary picture showing merely the animals, as they prove their usefulness by drawing heavy loads, not possible to be drawn by ordinary horses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080251</url></doc>
