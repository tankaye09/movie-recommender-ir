<plot>Josh Person's last novel has been refused once again. To find a new subject, he observes people in Central Park. Some of them, including a strange girl with a red bag, keep his attention for a minute, but nothing other than clichés can seem to come up. Tired of this game, Josh wanders in the streets of Manhattan when he finally sees the strange girl again. More and more intrigued by her, Josh starts to follow the girl and starts to imagine a story. The pursuit continues but Josh progressively loses the perception of what is real and what belongs to his fiction. In his search for the good story Josh finally discovers that his own might be the one to start from.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412654</url></doc>
