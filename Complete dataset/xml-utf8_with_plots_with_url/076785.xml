<plot>Bombay-based Ashok is a fast-talking conman who will do anything for a buck, cheat, steal, and even sell a laundry receipt as a lottery ticket. He has, however, written to his village-based mom, that he is the owner of the Taj Mahal Hotel, and is very wealthy, although he lives in a small room in a chawl. Ashok meets with Seema, and both fall in love. Seema has another admirer in Kumar, who will do anything to marry Seema, include abduct Ashok's mom, and hold her captive, until Ashok complies with his demands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076785</url></doc>
