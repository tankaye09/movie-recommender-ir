<plot>This illustrates one of the greatest dangers and difficulties of railroading in the mountain districts. The rotary, throwing out great clouds of black smoke and white steam, rounds a curve and strikes a great snow slide upon which a gang of fifty or more men have been working for hours. The machinery stops, the rotary backs off and comes ahead again and again, and continues bucking the great mass of hard packed snow until in fifteen minutes the track is once more open to traffic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503514</url></doc>
