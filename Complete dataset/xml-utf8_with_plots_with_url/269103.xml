<plot>Shankar and Ranno are in love with each other and want to get married. But her father arranges her marriage with U.S.-based Kulwant, she wants to refuse, but is unable to do so, as he has given his word. He passes away before the marriage, and in order to keep his word, she gets married and re-locates with Kulwant, leaving a devastated and heart-broken Shankar behind. The two lovers are fated to meet again when Ranno's pretty sister-in-law falls in love with Shankar's brother, Hans. Before Kulwant finds out about his wife's past love-life, Simran ends up getting abducted by Musibat Singh, Kulwant's tenant and aspiring brother-in-law, who has several scores to settle with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269103</url></doc>
