<plot>What should've been a happy, jovial welcoming for foreign exchange student Kimmo has quickly turned into something else. Something dark and sinister. from the moment he steps off the plane, Kimmo becomes entangled in the worst America's culture has to offer. From a botched drug deal to the disappearance of his host family, Kimmo must navigate a treacherous landscape and its inhabitants. Among those vying for a fresh piece of the new kid on the block include a hustling cab driver, a pair of rogue sheriff deputies, two homicidal brothers, and a mysterious government agency that oversees all. By days' end, Kimmo will receive an education far beyond his worst nightmares. Â </plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125134</url></doc>
