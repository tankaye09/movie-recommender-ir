<plot>The story of Consolidated Rail Corporation's historic railroad crossing through the mountains of Pennsylvania, home of historic Horseshoe Curve and heartland of the old Pennsylvania Railroad. Witness the steady procession of thundering trains between Altoona and Johnstown. Ride a locomotive out of Altoona as it climbs to the summit of the Alleghenies. Spend some time in the historic towers west of Altoona, where operators practice an age-old craft. Visit the Horshoe Curve National Visitor Center and Conrail's Juniata locomotive shops. The second of 32 award-winning documentaries about North America's greatest railroad locations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615702</url></doc>
