<plot>A young South Asian couple who move into a home, after having problems with their new business. A sacrifice for the better future so they thought. Soon after moving in Sheela begins experiencing unexplainable events. She hears footsteps coming from other rooms, voices, cries...scream. Husband Bobby is too busy caught up in work and his sexy new employee "Albina". With her marriage in trouble, and her house in chaos, Sheela takes matters into her own hands and begins to investigate the strange things happening to her. Sheela meets Jay Singh; a youthful landlord who just took over the family business. Jay lived in her home when he was a boy, but cannot explain the strange things happening to her. Jay Singh, already busy with his apartment building begins getting strange complaints from some of his tenants; similar to those of Sheela. Is the cursed necklace now in his apartment building? Can Sheela banish the spirit from her home, and save her marriage? The cursed MangalSutra is thirsty for blood, and will stop at nothing to get what it truly desires.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356093</url></doc>
