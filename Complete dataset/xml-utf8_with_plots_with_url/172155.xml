<plot>'El Mole y El Mezcal' was an idea born from repeated conversations between the filmmakers about the wonders of food and its cultural diversity. Combined with the fact that the actor/producer is from Mexico, one thing led to another and one night they found themselves together, armed with some chicken, mole sauce, a bottle of Mezcal, and a camera. What emerged was a sort of gastronomic poem about friendship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?172155</url></doc>
