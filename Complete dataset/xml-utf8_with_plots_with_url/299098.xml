In no time at all, her mother had gotten married to Pablo and was providing for his entire family. To make things worse, Pablo's daughter wanted Catherine's boyfriend for herself. As if these were not enough, Catherine killed Pablo's son, when he attempt to rape her. Pregnant with her boyfriend's child, she ended up in jail.
