<plot>Alfred and Erna have sold their farm and moved to the suburbs of a provincial town. It's December 26th and they are expecting their children and grandchildren for the annual Christmas lunch - for the first time in the new house. Alfred finds it hard to adjust to his new, quiet life. It's difficult for Erna to maintain old routines in a new situation and she loses herself in details. When her preparations for the lunch collapse, Alfred has had enough - but he realises that there is still a lot left to lose.</plot><plot>Alfred and Erna have sold their farm and moved to the suburbs of a provincial town.
