<plot>New Year's Day witnessed the first official act in connection with the coming Christian Endeavor convention at Denver. Governor James B. Orman of Colorado met Field Secretary Dr. C. E. Eberman of the Endeavors and warmly complimented him on the great gathering that will take place at Denver next summer. Thirty thousand persons interested in Endeavor work will be present. Gov. Orman met Dr. Eberman on the steps of the Colorado capitol. The city and state officers of the society were also present and received with cordiality. It was a most notable affair for Endeavorers. After the few minutes of pleasantries Dr. Eberman walked toward the camera and bowed to the operator. In the picture he grows more than life size and his pleasant smile and cheery face will be easily recognized for this worker in the good cause is known all over the world and his election to the office of president of the C.E. bodies will probably occur next summer. This film is a wonderful feature to add to a Colorado or church lecture series. It is not expensive but its drawing power is most phenomenal.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104777</url></doc>
