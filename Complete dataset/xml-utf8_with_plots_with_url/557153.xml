<plot>There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was either produced by Selznick nor distributed by World nor directed by Alan Crosland at this time. Either the film was never completed, or else this is the working title for some other, unidentifiable film which was eventually released under a completely different title. This entry has no relation to The Fear Market (1919) which was produced and released by Realart and directed by Kenneth Webb.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557153</url></doc>
