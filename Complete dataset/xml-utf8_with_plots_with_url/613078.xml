<plot>Thomas Bell's father was elected to the US congress but poor health forces him to step down so Tom decides to run for his father's vacated post; which he wins. On his first day, he learns that an American who works overseas, is being held, and it seems that the US is not going to help. But Tom who's very idealistic decides to look into it; it seems that the country that's holding wants something that Tom can't deliver without he help or approval of certain government officials but naturally they want something from Tom - to compromise some of his beliefs and convictions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?613078</url></doc>
