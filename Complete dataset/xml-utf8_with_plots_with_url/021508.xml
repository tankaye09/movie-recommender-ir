<plot>For 13 years James Stockton has been a loving father and husband to his wife and daughter. He is respected and admired by all the people in the town that he lives in. But things are going to change, it seems that James recently went on what he told his wife was a business trip. However, his wife caught him telling her a lie. She then does a little snooping and finds a picture of a girl. He tells her that she's an old girlfriend who died 14 years ago. She then asks a friend to find her, she is told that she did die 14 years ago, but her boyfriend was not James Stockton but Johnny Mancini, the son of a New Jersey gangster, who disappeared 14 years ago and was also the prime suspect in her death. Is James Johnny Mancini and did he kill her? And that is not all that is going on, some men from New Jersey have come to James' hometown and it seems that they are law enforcement officers and that James knows the lead man, but they are not arresting him, it seems that there is something that they want that they think that James has.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021508</url></doc>
