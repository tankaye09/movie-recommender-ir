<plot>Undoubtedly the best picture ever exhibited of the world's heavyweight champion, James J. Jeffries. Jeffries walks into his gymnasium at Oakland, Cal., accompanied by Billy Delaney, and begins exercising with the heavy weights. The view was taken with the champion close to the camera, and during the exercises his back is turned to the audience, when his great muscles stand out in bold relief, and, as he strains and tugs at the weights, they give one the impression of huge bands of knotted cords. So clear and well defined is the picture that one can easily imagine the champion himself standing before them exhibiting his marvelous physique.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275292</url></doc>
