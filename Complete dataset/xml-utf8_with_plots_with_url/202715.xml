<plot>Three brothers. A cellar. The cellar of their parent's house. Their refuge when they were kids. At the upper floor the rest of the family is preparing the Christmas lunch. It's been ten years the last Christmas that the brothers spent together. In the cellar there is a radio. An old abandoned radio full of dust. A radio syntonized on a station that transmit uncut phone calls from the public. A sort of live confessional, 24 hours per day, with no filter, where everyone tells what you can't tell. One brother purposes an "innocent" game: let's make a phone call. A "special" Russian roulette: the phone going around on the table and when it stops you have to make a phone call. "Your" phone call. But what happens when each of them starts to reveal, phone call after phone call, is real nature? What happens when they start to talk about Christmas Eve of ten years ago? What happens when we discover that two of the brothers died ten years ago? What happens when the past starts to become an "illness"?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202715</url></doc>
