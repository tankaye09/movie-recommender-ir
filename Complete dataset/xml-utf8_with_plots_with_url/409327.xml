<plot>Made about the time Congress was about to enact the Social Security Act, which was often referred to as an Old Age Pension plan. Henry Armetta's family members are a squabbling, selfish group who want him to spend all his hard-earned mosey on them as soon as he makes and, when he goes broke, lie about his age and claim an old-age pension from the government. He has a nightmare about it, and then tells his family where to get off.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409327</url></doc>
