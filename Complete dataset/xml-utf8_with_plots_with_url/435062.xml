<plot>'Play Hard Live Green' is about an athlete and environmentalist, about zero emissions and solar energy, and about...espresso. The film documents the quest of Justin Klabin, to get to town for a cup of espresso while producing near zero emissions. The film follows Justin on his electric bike powered purely from solar energy he produces in his own backyard, to get his favorite drink while avoiding using his 'two ton' car to get him there. An inspirational tale about following one's own path despite the questioning of others along the way. Justin wants to inspire you to create your own 'Play Hard Live Green' moment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?435062</url></doc>
