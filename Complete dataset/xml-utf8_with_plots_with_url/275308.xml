<plot>Jeff is a 40-year-old, beer-drinking, porno-consuming wrestling fanatic with Down's Syndrome. He lives in squalor at home with his 98-year-old, wheelchair-bound adopted mother who pins their future hopes on winning the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes. In the meantime, Jeff continues his daily existence, which includes petty theft, bum-rushing celebrities, and fondling women. At once both disturbing and heart-warming, Jeff is a character you'll never forget.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275308</url></doc>
