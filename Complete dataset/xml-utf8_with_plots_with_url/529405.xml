<plot>Best selling psychologist Gerald Williams, now at the height of his career, has a new client who seems to possess otherworldly abilities. His book has attracted her but for the first time he seems out of his depth. Is it his thoughts that are being read now? Not only that but is he also visiting other dimensions? He questions his colleague who is not so sure Gerald isn't losing his mind. But Gerald oddly feels whole and renewed and has learned many answers to lifelong questions. Yet there are new ones such as should he follow where this mysterious woman is taking him? Will he come back?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529405</url></doc>
