<plot>Bruno Desantis is a popular TV showman but Sofia, his wife, has left him. Bruno is still in love with her and tries to call her. Unfortunately, or fortunately, his telephone is out of order and he is forced to go out seeking for one. He ends in a house where he finds three women: Vera, Simona and Betty. The three are so moved by his distress to decide to cure him, to nourish him and, in the end, to love him. Bruno begins to live like a Sultan in his harem. But all the dreams come to an end and he finds himself alone again with his telephone still out of order and he is forced again to go out and to meet other women... who knows?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421607</url></doc>
