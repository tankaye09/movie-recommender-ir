<plot>"Many people see pimps as people who exploit young women for sex and money." These are the words of Percy "Pretty P" Rivers, a pimp enrolled in college. This mockumentary takes a satirical look at the pimp game and higher education, showing the relationship between the two. Through interviews and interactions with his girls, Percy takes us on a journey inside his life as a college pimp, showing us that not all pimps are in the game for sex and money. By the end of the film we learn that there are two types of people in this world: those who pimp and those who get pimped.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432978</url></doc>
