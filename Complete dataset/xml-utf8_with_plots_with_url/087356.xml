<plot>Two warring half-sisters, Elspeth and Hailey Hatchet, whose recently departed father's dying words were: "Just get along". In order to make his dream come true, the wealthy Mr. Hatchet stipulates in his will that neither sister shall receive any of his $500 million inheritance unless they can live together in the same house for 30 straight days. Hatchet has employed his bumbling Estate Executor, Toby Shore, to carry out his intentions by having the sisters stay at Shore's house so he can monitor their activities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087356</url></doc>
