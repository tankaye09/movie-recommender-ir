<plot>This film has the water scarcity that the city faces severely as its backdrop. It revolves around three interesting characters. 'Baskar', who takes up desalination of seawater as his ambition; His childhood friend 'Archana' who later turns out as his spouse; 'Madan', who makes pivot changes in others life with his sheer intelligence. What happens when these three meet up? How these characters use their brainpower variously is narrated sophisticatedly. How a young chap with such an ambition arising from a third world nation triumphs is told with an interesting screenplay.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?285796</url></doc>
