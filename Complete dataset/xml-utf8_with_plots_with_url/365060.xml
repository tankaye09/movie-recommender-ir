<plot>Using undercover footage and stills, Meltdown in Tibet blows the lid off China's huge and potentially catastrophic dam-building projects in Tibet. The mighty rivers sourced in Tibet are lifelines to the people of India and Southeast Asia. These rivers are at great risk from rapidly receding glaciers-a meltdown accelerated by climate change-and from large-scale damming and diversion, due to massive Chinese engineering projects. To make way for these hydro power projects and for mining ventures, Tibetan nomads are being forced off their traditional grassland habitat-and resettled in bleak villages, where they cannot make a decent living. The film raises some disturbing questions about a looming eco-disaster.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365060</url></doc>
