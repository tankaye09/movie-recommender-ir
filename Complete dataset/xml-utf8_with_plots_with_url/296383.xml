<plot>A short street somewhere in Upper Silesia and everybody knows everybody. There is a reason why houses here are called "familioks". A place where the tradition deeply ingrained in people's consciousness has remained unaffected by radical change. The building of Drogowa Trasa Srednicowa will turn Piekarska Street into a highway. In March the last house was pulled. The identity of a place that gave home to ordinary - extraordinary life will only linger in the memories of those who have moved to modern residential areas and a trace of that time will be preserved in our film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?296383</url></doc>
