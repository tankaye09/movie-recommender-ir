<plot>Amy is a little girl who can't accept her grandfather's passing away. Her grandfather always taught her, 'Life is like dandelions. They won't disappear. They are just going to a new place to start a new life...' These words are embedded in her heart, but she never notices that. However, while she keeps feeling sad of her grandfather's death, these sentences give her infinite courage to release her mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125770</url></doc>
