<plot>Alexis Winston (Taylor Firth) is a young girl who dreams of becoming a champion figure skater. While practicing, Alexis suffers a terrible accident that takes her sight and threatens to destroy her dreams. In the midst of feeling sorry for herself she falls in love with a handsome young man named Nick (Rob Mayes) who (with help from her family) helps her to realize that she can still fulfill her dreams. The film is a remake of the popular 1978 version, which was nominated for a few awards, including an Oscar.
