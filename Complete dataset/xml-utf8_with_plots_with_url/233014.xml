<plot>Headstrong follows six very different adults into the hidden world of dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Discover the untold story of an Alabama civil rights hero who won an historic dyslexia discrimination law suit; share a teenager's struggle in a California public school as he discloses his ADHD for the first time; and enter the remarkable life of a 44 year-old dyslexic single mother on welfare as she strives to graduate from a top university. Our narrator, Ben, is on his own journey to understand the dyslexia that has driven and frustrated him throughout his life. He takes us from Northern California to the deep South in search of the people and insights that will connect this unseen community.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233014</url></doc>
