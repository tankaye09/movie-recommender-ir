<plot>"This film is full of fun. To see the soldiers dancing, tossing one of their number up in the air and catching him in a sheet, and their various antics, seems as though they have no fear of the enemy who is close at hand. Their mascot, the goat, is seen romping about, presumably in quest of tin cans and gum shoes, a delicate morsel enjoyed only by a goat, so it is said. A picture of this kind provokes laughter and bids fair to enliven your audience after they have seen the more sad pictures incident to the war. You want this film by all means."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206736</url></doc>
