<plot>Focuses on the now-destroyed Technology Center (also known as the Performance Network), a former factory and warehouse appropriated by struggling artist as a pirate utopia in a city with encroaching economic development and skyrocketing living costs. In 2003, this space was raided, its inhabitant evicted in the middle of winter, the building sold, bulldozed, and finally burned to the ground in a firestorm the engulfed the city block mysteriously weeks into the demolition process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652512</url></doc>
