<plot>Fifth Waltons TV movie is set in 1964 which has John-Boy Walton planning his wedding to Janet Gilchrist, the editor of a New York fashion magazine and the daughter of a diplomat. The two of them plan a small wedding and he invites the family and friends from Walton's Mountain to come to New York for the celebration. But Janet's Aunt Flo has other ideas and begins to take over their wedding preparations. Added to the wedding plan stress, John-Boy is also trying to write an article about his Grandma, but decides that he needs to go home to escape the wedding preparations, as well as to reunite with his Grandmother and fill in some gaps leaving Janet in New York trying to prevent her wedding from getting out of hand. But she too leaves the city and heads for Walton's Mountain to plan their wedding there. Meanwhile, Olivia has decided that the time is right for her to return to school and she enrolls in a class at Boatwright University. Being a married woman, with a family, returning to study makes her lecturer wonder why she is there and he makes her time in his class very difficult. Also, John has his problems when he's been elected as a County Supervisor and the lumber company which he and Ben run stands to profit if he votes for a proposed subdivision to go ahead. By this time Elizabeth's boyfriend Drew is also working at the mill and Jason's very pregnant wife Toni goes through a series of false alarms as her due date draws near.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018027</url></doc>
