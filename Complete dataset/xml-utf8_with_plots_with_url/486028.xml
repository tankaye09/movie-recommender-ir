<plot>Paul Reed is doing some final campaigning on election day. He is in a dead heat with his opponent, Jonah Burns, for the People's Party nominee for Governor of Vermont. But more grueling than campaigning against Jonah has been the politics at home. His wife, while a supporter of Paul's politics, refuses to disclose her personal finances, and while she is not extremely wealthy, her reluctance is casting her, and Paul, in suspicious light. However, they never get a chance to resolve their differences. Paul wins his party's nomination and while he is giving a radio address to the state, his wife is involved in a fatal car accident. Reeling from this loss, and left with his thirteen year-old step-daughter, Maggie, Paul decides it's time to return to his family farm, a place he hasn't set foot in over five years. He hopes to make amends with his mom and brother and give Maggie a place to recover. But the reasons he hasn't been there in five years become more and more apparent. He is forced by everyone around him to examine himself and his actions and as he begins to uncover the man he truly is, he must decide if he can remain true to himself and his family if he remains in politics, or if he must give up his hard won nomination for Governor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?486028</url></doc>
