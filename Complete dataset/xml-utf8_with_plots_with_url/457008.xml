<plot>Best friends, Luke and Marcus, are at a grungy dive bar well after midnight. Luke has just come back from the worst date of his life -- he has just discovered that his latest girlfriend was not only a stripper, but that she knows his father 'in the biblical sense'. This latest humiliation puts Luke over the edge. He believes that his problem with women stems from the fact that he might be gay. He asks his best friend to help him find out if he is gay by kissing him... just once... on the lips.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457008</url></doc>
