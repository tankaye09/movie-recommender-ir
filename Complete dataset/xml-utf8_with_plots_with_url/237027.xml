<plot>Herman Lindqvist (well-known Swedish author of popular historical books of nonfiction and causeries of his life in Paris and elsewhere in the world) tells the story of a person or event in Swedish history. He does it dramatically and keenly; his programs are not your average history lesson, but almost as exciting an adventure as if it had been a film with real acting. Herman Lindqvist has been accused of getting many details wrong in his history television programs as well as in his books, and unfortunately, he does.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?237027</url></doc>
