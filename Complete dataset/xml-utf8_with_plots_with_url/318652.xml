<plot>A girl has to work as a stripper due to an unfortunate family situation. She is very uncomfortable doing so, it tears her apart inside, shakes her down to her very core, however she has no choice. Whilst dancing she imagines herself as a Glamorous Burlesque dancer in the 1940's,this is her happy place, a way to deal with what she is doing. She is quickly snapped back to reality as she is placed in many difficult situations, that go against her beliefs. Her Mother is her life, her strength, the only thing that keeps her going...... What would you do for a loved one, how far would you go? People often are to quick to judge in today's society, If you were placed in the same situation, would you do whatever it takes, regardless of other peoples opinions?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318652</url></doc>
