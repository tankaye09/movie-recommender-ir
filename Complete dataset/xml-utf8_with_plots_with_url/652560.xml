<plot>A documentary film crew films the life of Wheeler, the fire planeteer from Captain Planet. It has been 15 years since the Planeteers broke up and Wheeler's life is in shambles: he loses his job at the Environmental Protection Agency, his girlfriend breaks up with him and sleeps with a member of the film team. Wheeler goes on a drinking binge and ends up pawning his fire ring. A few months later, Wheeler starts his own business and begins turning his life around selling very plain pizza while dressed in a bear suit. Wheeler also attends Super Powers Anonymous (SPA) meetings where he encounters other superheroes who have lost their powers. Wheeler attempts to buy his ring back from the pawn shop but discovers that it has been resold and is lost forever. Wheeler must now figure out how to survive without the thing that has defined so much of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652560</url></doc>
