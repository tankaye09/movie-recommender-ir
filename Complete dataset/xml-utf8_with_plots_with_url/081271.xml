<plot>Boys' almost irresistible tendency to mischief may be proverbial, as in the saying the title quotes, but when Jeff Sterne stars, this is repressed by remorse-inducing discipline on their fittingly humbled, painfully bouncing bared behinds (they even end up starkers). First Kyle Palmer goes over the knee to feel a literal firm hand (14:20 min). Then Johhny is suspended by chains in the garage, to be floggered on both back and lower part of his backside (17'34). Next the frailer Pookie goes over the knee, for both hand-spanking ad the brush (15'02). Finally Latino Yancey stands bend over with his elbows on a stool in the bedroom and sees in the mirror how his rear is tanned bright red by hand, paddle and ping-pong bat (15'42).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081271</url></doc>
