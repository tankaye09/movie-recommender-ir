<plot>Flying With Emilio Carranza takes you to a small community in New Jersey, where every year tribute is paid to a virtually unknown Mexican hero. Captain Emilio Carranza has been dubbed "Mexico's Charles Lindbergh." In 1928, while flying a goodwill mission from New York, his plane crashed in Tabernacle, New Jersey during a thunderstorm. Since his death, members of American Legion Post 11 in Mount Holly have continued to promote goodwill by honoring Captain Carranza. We sit down with the men of Post 11 who have honored this fallen hero for almost 80 years, and hear their stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198658</url></doc>
