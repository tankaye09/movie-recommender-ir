<plot>It's an up-close and personal interview with Ingvild Soederlind, a pilot with the Scandinavian Airline Systems. While sitting in front of her instrument panel, which closely resembles a kitchen range, she talks about making the move to SAS from the Norwegian air force, all for better pay. As she takes off and lands, Ingvild fills us in on the three major challenges of being a pilot, and she explains her recent move from short- to long-distance flights, trading time with her family for higher wages and the chance to see exotic places. Will she become a role model for other young women who haven't yet thought of themselves working outside the kitchen?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384218</url></doc>
