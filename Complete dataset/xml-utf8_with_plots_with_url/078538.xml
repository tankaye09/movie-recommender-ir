<plot>A young couple is running a business to answer to the demand of desperate people. After examining a new case, the young woman finds herself conflicted in her intentions and is having second thoughts of what is right and crossing the blurred line of what is wrong. She can't help but think about the righteousness of their purpose. Her partner reminds her of the purity of their intention which is to help people. Then one day she finds herself on the side of the road with a flat tire; an older man stops to help her out. Now she has to decide between what is humane and what her soul can handle. Nevertheless, she pursues her mission with her partner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078538</url></doc>
