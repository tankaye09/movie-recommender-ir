<plot>The things aren't always as they seem. The postman always rings twice, like the opportunities, or were neighbors? This is the story, at least one point of the history is about Lola. Lola is ethologist, which not everyone understands. In addition she is a psychologist online for animals, she is one of those people who can not say no. Lola's inability to refuse to lend a hand, takes her to help some of her neighbors, new or old. Meanwhile, Lola's mother thinks her daughter is a selfish, never is there when she is more needed. Will be that things are not always what they seem. And Lola, either. But above all, is that everyone deserves a second chance, and third, and fourth, and ... Lola's neighbors, too.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432288</url></doc>
