<plot>Dharam Singh is a honest farmer in rural India, and lives with his sister, Bela, who is now of marriageable age. One day both brother and sister witness a murder, and haul the killer to the nearest police station, where the killer is charged, arrested, and held for court. The killer is none other than the powerful and influential Arjun Singh's brother. When Arjun comes to know about Dharam and Bela being the only witnesses to this murder, he attempts to bribe them, albeit in vain, and his brother is sentenced to be hanged. In order to escape Arjun's wrath, Dharam relocates to the city, to earn a living, and thereby help his sister get married. Arjun sets fire to Dharam's house in the village, abducts Bela, and attempts to rape her, but she escapes, and goes in search of Dharam. After several months, she spots Dharam in the city in the company of a rich woman, Barkha. When she goes up to Dharam, he refuses to recognize her, and has nothing to do with her. All the songs are still immensely popular even now.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423408</url></doc>
