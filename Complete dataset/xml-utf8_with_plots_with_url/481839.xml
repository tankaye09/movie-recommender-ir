<plot>Rick admits: he is almost beaten by Amy with scrabble. But then out of the blue, he comes up with a 37 point word. It's just one of Rick's tricks to bring Amy out of balance. Rick thinks he's by far superior in intelligence than Amy. The only problem is that Amy is not dumb at all and she comes up with a magnificent word. Rick feels cornered and desperately he decides to make up a word: shoer. But Amy doesn't agree with it. Things are hottening up now. Will their relationship hold?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481839</url></doc>
