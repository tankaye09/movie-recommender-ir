<plot>A young man with a smile on his face and a coffee cup in his hand leaves his row house, waves at someone left behind, and walks toward his bus stop, a Walkman playing in his ears. At the stop, he starts a pole dance - and it seems to remind him of recently grabbing another pole, one that resembles a bed post. Is our acrobat recalling a gymnastic conquest? He's a very good dancer; but what else might he be good at?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410519</url></doc>
