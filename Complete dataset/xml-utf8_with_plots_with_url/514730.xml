<plot>Join director Francis Coppola and his remarkable cast (including Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe and C. Thomas Howell) as they reminisce about their experiences shooting "The Outsiders" in 1982 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The film was based on the best-selling novel by S.E. Hinton. Cinematographer Stephen Burum explains how many of the special process shots were done. The story of how a middle school class from Fresno, California convinced Coppola to adapt their favorite book into a film is told. The documentary concludes with a 20-year reunion at Coppola's home (2003) during which the cast is shown the new version of the film with 22 minutes of scenes that had been cut restored to make The Outsiders - The Complete Novel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514730</url></doc>
