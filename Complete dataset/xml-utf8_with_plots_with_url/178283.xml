<plot>In the battle of San Juan Hill, Rough Rider Dale Brittenham (Jack Holt) saves the life, at the expense of losing the sight of one eye, of Bob Hildreth (Guinn Williams.) Invalided to a hospital they meet nurse Belle Pearson (Louise Henry) and a love-feud begins between Dale and Bob over Belle. At the end of the war Dale and Bob return to Halsey, a small mid-western cattle town,where Belle comes as a school teacher, bringing her brother Larry (John McGuire.) Cattle thieves have run ranchers out of business and Bill Mason (Douglass Dumbrille) seems to be the only prosperous citizen.Bob gets his pre-war job back and is made Chief Deputy for Sheriff Anderson (Frank Shannon.) Dale can't get work and leaves town. Broke and hungry he shows up at the Square Deal Saloon in Fremont Pass,where Mason offers him a job herding wild horses out of the territory. Dale soon learns that Mason is the head of the rustlers and starts re-stealing the cattle from Mason's rustlers. Mason can't report them to the sheriff since they weren't his to begin with. Dale's recycling program makes him enough money to open a club called "Little Cuba." Larry is working as an undercover deputy, and Dale warns him that Mason and his men are on to him,and he needs to stay out of the South Valley. Mason's men kidnap Larry and Dale rescues him but kills one of Mason's men. Bob sees the killing, but rather than arrest his old friend Dale, decides to resign. Dale arranges to send Larry to California, decides to go straight and Belle accepts his marriage proposal.While they are preparing to close "Little Cuba", a truck rolls by and dumps Larry's dead body. Dales knows Mason did it and, despite Bob's efforts to persuade him to let the law take care of it,kills Mason. This time, Bob cannot forsake his sworn duty and arrests Dale, who is convicted and sentenced to death. As he is led away, he waves proudly to the weeping Belle and Bob.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178283</url></doc>
