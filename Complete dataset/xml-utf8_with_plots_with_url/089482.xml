<plot>C64 Classix is a compilation of more than 500 Commodore 64 games on one Windows / Mac CD-ROM. The games are stored in original C64 format and can be played with the included Emulator WinVice. The games are loaded automatically when you click on them in a special GUI (Windows only). So you do not have to load them one by one in the emulator. You can read additional information for each game: Screenshots, year of release, manuals, original companies, links to their web pages and more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089482</url></doc>
