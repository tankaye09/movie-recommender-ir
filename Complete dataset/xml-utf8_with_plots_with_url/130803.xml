<plot>Jintaro, a 24-year-old fisherman in a backward village on the Pacific Coast does not have many friends, but can't find time to spend with all the girls who are after him. Osome, his promised fiancée, is not at all shy, and in fact the couple has sex before marriage, and are the village priests in the immemorial fertility rites. Shizui will try to break this perfect arrangement by trying to have Jintaro for herself alone - but even that will not be a problem. (The original film title translates literally as «The Women's Large Fish Catch Festival».)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130803</url></doc>
