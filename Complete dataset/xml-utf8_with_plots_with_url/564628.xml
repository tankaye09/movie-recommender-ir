<plot>On a hot afternoon in the middle of nowhere, Martin is a desperate hitchhiker who hasn't seen a car all day. He finally gets a break only to discover the ride isn't as straightforward as it seems. Kit, a well dressed driver in her late thirties, won't let Martin in the car until she's absolutely sure he's "safe." Little does Martin know that this will take a while. Two worlds collide in this comedy about what it means to help someone out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564628</url></doc>
