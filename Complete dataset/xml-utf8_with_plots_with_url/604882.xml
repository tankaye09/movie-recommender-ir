<plot>This two-hour documentary traces the history of swing, from its first emergence in the 1920s to its current revival across the United States, Canada and Europe. "This Joint Is Jumpin'" takes you back to a time when zoot suit-clad hepcats hit the dance floor with dolls in full-skirted dresses and seamed stockings. All troubles were forgotten to the hip sounds of Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller. You'll also hear how the original swing bands influenced current groups like the Brian Setzer Orchestra and Big Bad VooDoo Daddy. So put on your dancing shoes and hit the floor because..."This Joint Is Jumpin'"!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604882</url></doc>
