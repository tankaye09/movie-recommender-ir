<plot>In present-day UAE, a drama unfolds surrounding an old woman, Um Alkul (Moza Almazroie), who is well known for always having helped people. In a related story, an artist runs amok after a painfully felt incident. The Emirati Um Alkul (Literally: "mother of all") lovingly fulfills the role of mother and benefactor for Rabie, Sarah and the Palestinian young lady Deema. Um Alkul's son Sultan was an artist who studied abroad and returned with liberal ideas that did not find favor with his society. When Um Alkul goes into a coma, her family begins to crumble, and the young couple starts to investigate her motivations and character. Deema is courted by the stateless young man Adel and a rivalry for her heart takes place between him and Rabie. Warda, Dr Sarah's patient and Adel's sister, dies. Rabie abandons the family when he discovers that he is an orphan with no known parents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?228822</url></doc>
