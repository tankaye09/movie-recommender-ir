<plot>Meet Colin Carroll, Irishman - lawyer - Sumo Wrestler! the Fermoy-based lawyer with one thing on his mind - taking silliness seriously! After recovering from a broken back, Colin had a new found respect for the gift of bodily movement. Join Colin as we follow him on his quest to break the World Record for the three-legged marathon at the 2008 Cork City Marathon, all the highs and lows of running three legged, the unique pacifistic approach to training, not to mention trying to find a running partner! And If that's not enough, it has Elephant Polo, Backwards Running, Hornsleding, Argentinian Motorbike Adventures, Eastern European boybands and most importantly, a new way of looking at sport - The Paddy Olympics!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016859</url></doc>
