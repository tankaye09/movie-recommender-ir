<plot>In Switzerland unemployed persons may complete an internship in an east-European company as part of a temporary work scheme. Rolande and Jérôme are two such persons, willing to embark on adventure. She is over 50, he is barely 25, but they are united by their unemployment status and by the fact that neither has ever been to Russia. Thrown into the deep end of Russia's foreign culture they soon realize that the journey is going to have profound consequences for the rest of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245843</url></doc>
