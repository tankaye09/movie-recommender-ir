<plot>A new employee starts her first day of work at the fast food join "Strum" (home of the Strumburger), but in a restaurant where mindless corporate loyalty rules, Michelle (The Newbie) does her best to fit in but finds herself failing at every turn. After starting her shift with the "Company Cheer", Michelle is shown the ropes by her antagonistic Manager who is less-than-impressed by the new employee. After dropping a bowl, the Manager flirts with The Employee of the Month, but when the Drive Thru Drone becomes overwhelmed at the backlog of cars at the Drive Thru, the new employee must help get the burgers ready. When she drops the buns on the floor everyone comes to the rescue. The Manager sends her to lunch and while watching the others relax Michelle sees that stranger things are happening at the burger joint called "Strum". Later that day, Michelle drops the hamburgers on the floor causing more panic and disaster. Exasperated, the Manager fires Michelle when she proves she really doesn't belong at Strum.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518856</url></doc>
