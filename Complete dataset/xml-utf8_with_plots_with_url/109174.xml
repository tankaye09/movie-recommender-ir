<plot>A clown enters holding a bottle of beer in one hand while in the other he holds a glass. Drawing the cork, he fills the glass but before drinking he places the tumbler on the chair standing near and proceeds to attend to something at the opposite side of the room. Meanwhile a man enters and spying the beer, drinks it down before the Clown returns. The Clown is very angry when he finds his drink gone but not to be outwitted, he seizes a large spigot lying near and driving it into the man's side, he draws a glass of beer from him and drinks it down with gusto.
