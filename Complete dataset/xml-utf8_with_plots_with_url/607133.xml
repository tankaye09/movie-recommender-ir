<plot>Short-lived remake of the classic game show in which two contestants, one a returning champion, competed. Contestants earned their mark (either X or O) by correctly answering questions in general knowledge and popular culture questions; some of the categories were designated "red squares," where either contestant could earn the box by completing certain requirements in answering a question. All questions added $500 to the pot, except for the center box question that was worth $1,000. The first player to get tic-tac-toe won the cash value of the jackpot; tie games were played if necessary. The champion again played a bonus game for a prize package, which the contestant won by finding three of his mark (either X or O) in a row; finding the dragonslayer automatically won the game, while uncovering the dragon lost all bonus game winnings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?607133</url></doc>
