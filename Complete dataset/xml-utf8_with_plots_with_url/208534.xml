<plot>Gags, short for Anthony Gagliano, married his high school sweetheart Red, a name given to her for her fiery red hair and matching personality. When the marriage doesn't work out, due to Gags' meddling Italian mother, Red moves to Las Vegas to create a little "space" since growing up in the same neighborhood makes it hard for Red to do anything without Gags finding out about it. She takes a job as a nutritionist in a gym. Gags suddenly decides to move the family business to Las Vegas' since Las Vegas is a booming construction mecca. Everyone knows it's because he's still in love with Red. Gags also decides to join a gym to get in shape and you can guess which gym he chooses. Red is secretly glad Gags is there since she is finding that her New york attitude is making her more of a fish out of water than she thought. The characters in the gym are a diverse collection of zany personalities and the perfect petri dish for comedy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208534</url></doc>
