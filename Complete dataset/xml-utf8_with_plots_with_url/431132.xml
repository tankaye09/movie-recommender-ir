<plot>Phil comes into work to find another typical day of ridicule. Constantly bullying and a rough childhood has made him into the person he is and by using the fantasy of Zorro he escapes from his harsh reality. It isn't until a new girl starts at his work that he needs to face his fears and use his "special skills" from within his fantasy for a real-life struggle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431132</url></doc>
