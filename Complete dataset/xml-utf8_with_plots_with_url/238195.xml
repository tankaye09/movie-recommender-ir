<plot>For Jonathan Charles, life is like young love-awkward and usually disappointing. Stifled at work, unable to speak up for himself, and afraid of any sort of confrontation, he plods about his daily routine in a state of blissful complacency. But when his wife tells him she's ovulating, Jonathan must confront a series of obstacles more complicated than the female reproductive system itself. Now, in order to get home in time, he will have to penetrate the dark hole of his existence and then sow the seeds of potency waiting to burst forth from within.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238195</url></doc>
