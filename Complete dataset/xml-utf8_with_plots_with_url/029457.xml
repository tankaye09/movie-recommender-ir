<plot>Pilot for the remake of the 1950'-1960's TV series introduces four episodes which were remakes of the original episodes from the original "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" series. In the first, "Incident In A Small Jail", Ned Beatty plays a mild-mannered traveling businessman pulled over for speeding in a small town where he is locked up in a jail with a murder suspect which takes another turn when a vigilante mob lays siege to the place. In "Man From The South" Steven Bauer is a gambler in Las Vegas who accepts a bet with John Huston, a mysterious old southern man, that he can light his cigarette lighter 10 times and if he misses one light, the man from the south will chop off the gambler's little finger on his right hand. In "Bang! You're Dead!" a little girl takes her visiting uncle's .38 caliber revolver and goes around pointing it at people and yelling "bang" in which she eventually loads with real bullets. In "An Unlocked Window" a wife learns that her husband has a lot of secrets that she does not know about.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?029457</url></doc>
