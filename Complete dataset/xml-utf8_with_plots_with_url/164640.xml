<plot>CHICK, a good cop, stands up for himself and his friends for the first time in his life when his nemesis GIL kills his partner ZEKE at the behest of a Muslim brutha named MALIK - a powerful crime lord, known pimp, drug dealer, gun-runner, murderer, and all around bad man. But without Zeke, Chick is the only decent sheriff in Mission City, a small, decaying, outlaw ghetto where revenge, betrayal, good amongst evil, and double-crossing bad-asses are commonplace. His ex-wife ADELIA, old friends, fellow lawmen, and even Zeke's widow, leave Chick's side at his time of dire need because they do not believe in his noble cause of cleaning up the future ghost town. Chick badgers SHARK, a smooth card hustler, to let him into his infamous and semi-crooked poker game in order to win some loot for Zeke's wife, a form of penance because Chick feels guilty for Zeke's murder. Shark reluctantly lends Chick a stake, but when he promptly loses it, Shark tells him he has to kill Malik to pay his debt: this will be Chick's death sentence. Chick confronts Malik in a botched murder attempt, but Malik kills Chick and his henchmen leave his dead body on the outskirts of town. Chick begins his resurrection with the help of an ANGEL. He has a choice - die and go quietly into the hereafter, or come back as an avenging archangel of death, bent on revenge - but his soul will know no peace - just vengeance, roaming the earth forever with nothing but an angry heart to keep him company.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164640</url></doc>
