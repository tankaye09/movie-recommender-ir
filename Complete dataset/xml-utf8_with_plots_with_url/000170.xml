<plot>This is the banner picture of them all and it almost defies description. The yachts crossing the line in this race follow tactics heretofore unknown in the cup races. As both boats went over the line the balloon topsails were shaken out and the spinnaker sails were set. The yachts were close to our camera when these sails were given to the winds, and the effect is most beautiful and adds one hundred per cent to the picture. Immediately the spinnakers and the balloon topsails catch the wind the yachts are seen to leap forward in the water as though propelled by steam. Our panoramic camera is here set in motion and the yachts are followed until they have almost passed out of sight.</plot><plot>This is the banner picture of them all and it almost defies description.
