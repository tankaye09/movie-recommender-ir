<plot>Mr. Singh lives a wealthy lifestyle in a mansion named 'Ashiana' on 10th Road, Juhu, Bombay, with his only relative, a niece by the name of Nisha, who is unmarried and runs the family's business that faces strong opposition from Khanna Group of Industries. Singh would like to see her get married but she hates wealthy men. So her uncle finds a poor man, Ajay Srivastav, but subsequently finds out that Ajay is already married and also has 3 daughters; then he decides to get Nisha married to a TV repairman, Yeshwant Bhosle, who ends up being a multi-millionaire after his invention is marketed; then he wants her to get married to Viju Guide, a Hyderabad-based Tourist Guide, who finds buried treasure and also ends up a multi-millionaire; then he wants her to get married to a motor mechanic, Prakash, who, in turn, ends up being the only son of wealthy builder, Jayant Amar Nath, and ends up getting married to his sweetheart and neighbor, Rosy. Finally Nisha meets her ideal match in Rukhtapur-based Suraj Singh, a wedding singer/dancer, and gets married to him - not realizing that Suraj is not who he claims to be and she is merely a pawn in a charade that has been created especially to pull wool over her eyes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054108</url></doc>
