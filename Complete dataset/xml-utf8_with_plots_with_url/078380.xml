<plot>A remarkable picture taken during the war games on Long Island Sound, showing the flagship "Kearsage" and the battleships "Illinois," "Indiana" and "Massachusetts" steaming at full speed in single column formation, and firing from all their batteries at the fortifications guarding the harbor of Newport. One of the greatest marine films ever made.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078380</url></doc>
