<plot>Rauya is in her early forties when her husband decides to leave her for a younger, less talented but more attractive woman. The spurned wife remains with her daughter, pulls herself together and lands a job working at a newspaper.She gets interested in the good-looking editor, but when he begins to respond she backs off. Although he is separated from his wife, that is not the same as being officially divorced, and not good enough to risk an involvement. Later, her husband has turned against his new wife, and tries to force his way back into Rauya's life, but she is in no mood to rewrite her future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624365</url></doc>
