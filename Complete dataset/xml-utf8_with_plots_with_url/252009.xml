<plot>Brad McArthur hires Clint Reynolds as his press agent when he is charged with manslaughter and wants to build himself up in the public's eye as a humanitarian. Clint has him adopt an orphan newsboy, Bobby, of whom Brad becomes very fond. But Clint and Brad's girlfriend Linda, carrying on an affair behind his back, double-cross him. When Linda lies about Bobby, Maggie, the kind-hearted cook tells Brad the truth. He throws Clint and Linda out of the house. The adverse publicity, as Clint tries for revenge, makes Brad decide jump bail and leave town. He and Bobby end up in a mountain resort owned by Alice Martin, and Brad and Alice fall in love. The police are closing in, after been tipped off by Linda, and Brad sacrifices his freedom by rescuing Bobby from drowning. Bobby and Alice promise to wait for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252009</url></doc>
