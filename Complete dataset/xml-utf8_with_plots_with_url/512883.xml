<plot>Bart's girlfriend Marina's favorite movie is "To Catch a Thief," she talks about cat burglars, and she loves surprises. So, Bart enlists his friend Jack as the lookout while he sneaks into her apartment at night wearing a ski mask to leave an engagement ring. They test their walkie-talkies. Marina is still awake and moving around her apartment, so when Jack, with his night-vision binoculars, is distracted by a woman in another apartment, this may be a problem. Plus, Bart's not much of a cat burglar. What if Marina hears or sees him skulking? Will he be dead before he can propose?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?512883</url></doc>
