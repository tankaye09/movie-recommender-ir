<plot>In this motivational drama, Brian Cane shares to friend Greg his feelings and stories of wanting to become a successful actor in Hollywood. Through a metaphoric, physical and enduring journey it is explained how Brian felt before coming to Los Angele to pursue his dream, and certain events and realizations he had which helped him develop a new outlook. Before getting very deep into the industry, Brian came to respect it more after seeing how much more different and difficult it was than he ever imagined.
