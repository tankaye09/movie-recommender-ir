<plot>This documentary examines the life and legacy of one of America's most important and least appreciated artists, Louis H. Sullivan (1856-1924). Although well known and revered in Chicago where he was one of the original practitioners of the "Chicago School", Sullivan is virtually unknown compared to the fame enjoyed by his onetime chief draftsman and confidante, Frank Lloyd Wright. Louis Sullivan: The Struggle for American Architecture will be the first comprehensive exploration of this brilliant American artist ever presented on film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344122</url></doc>
