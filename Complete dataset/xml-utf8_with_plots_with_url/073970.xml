<plot>Running for only four months, this short-lived game show paired regular contestants with celebrity guests in a test of head-to-head wits and communication skills. One of the celebrity guests would describe one of several words that had been cut from a mystery sentence, taking twenty seconds to give his description. The guest's partner, who had been in isolation, would be allwoed to hear the description, but the opposing contestant was allowed to 'censor' up to seven seconds of it. If the contestant still managed to guess the correct word, he would then have a chance at solving the entire puzzle. If not, the opponent would be allowed to guess the word, having heard the entire 20-second description. Play passed back and forth in this manner until the entire sentence had been solved.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073970</url></doc>
