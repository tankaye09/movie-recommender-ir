<plot>Orphaned Raju Tarachand is cared for by his maternal uncle, Brij, and aunt, Basanti, in Nainital. Raju decides to re-locate to Mumbai to make a name for himself in a firm run by Chaturvedi. Upon arrival, he finds out that Chaturvedi's firm has gone bankrupt. He goes job-hunting, ends up having his luggage, wallet, and car stolen by a man named Chali. He locates Chali and forces him to provide accommodation, while he lands himself a job with Malhotra Group of Companies as a lowly Peon. He falls in love with the dress designer, Jasmin Arora, and comes to her assistance as Husn Bano. When he finds out that Malhotra's elder brother, and his associate, M.R. Poplet, are scheming to bring down Mr. Malhotra, he masquerades as David Rathod, an American trouble-shooter. He has Poplet well in check and ready for exposure, as well as has Jasmin eating out of his hand, when another peon by the name of 'God', and the appearance of the real David Rathod virtually turns his life upside down - and instead of being shown as a good Samaritan he is arrested and jailed, giving Poplet and the elder Malhotra complete freedom to do what they originally wanted to do - bring down Chhotey Malhotra.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664584</url></doc>
