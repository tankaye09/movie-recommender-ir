<plot>Here is a decided novelty. Sea lions are not to be seen every day, and it is your privilege to show about 12 in number, being fed by their trainer, Capt. Paul Boynton. After feeding them on shore they follow him about and crowd him so that he steps into the water and continues to feed them. One more venturesome than the rest steals some of the food out of the basket. The water rolling off their backs sparkles and shines so much so as to lead one to believe that they are made of glass. This subject is animated to a wonderful degree and everyone witnessing it will call for a repetition. A most brilliant picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191652</url></doc>
