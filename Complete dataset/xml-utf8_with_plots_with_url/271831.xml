<plot>Jill is an attractive woman, successful at her job, with a beautiful apartment on Central Park South. On the exterior, she seems to have everything going for her, but there is an uneasiness about her. The last thing she imagined, as she dressed for work this morning, was that she would run into an old colleague, Jack. Jack has also done well for himself. He's become a company CEO, has a loving family and owns a plush Long Island home. Fifteen years ago the two experienced a traumatic event that shattered Jill's life. When she spots her old friend on a subway platform she immediately has a horrifying flashback, reliving that daunting day. She is angered to learn that Jack, not only seems unaffected, he doesn't even remember her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271831</url></doc>
