<plot>Produced and directed by Richard Schickel, this 90-minute documentary is mostly an informal look at the life and career of landmark film director Martin Scorsese - plus film clips - and one of the world's most engaging conversationalists. In the TCM produced film, Mr. Scorsese just talks about his movies, with a lot of good humor and insight. He speaks at a quick pace, whether he is explaining how his own Italian-American childhood informed "Goodfellas" (1990) or recalling his mind-meld with Robert De Niro during the making of "The King of Comedy." (1983). Scorsese has something interesting to say about almost every movie he has made or seen. Film clips from his movies include "Mean Streets" (1973); "Taxi Driver," (1976); "New York New York" (1977); "Raging Bull" (1980); "The Last Temptation of Christ" (1988); "Cape Fear" (1991); "The Age of Innocence" (1993); "Casino" (1995); "Gangs of New York" (2002) and "The Aviator" (2004).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481685</url></doc>
