<plot>Leon needs to make a business deal with Mr. Marshall but can't unless his son and Marshall's daughter straighten out their romantic problems. Leon, probably based on his own past history and the assumption that an apple never falls far from the tree, suspects that his son is playing around with the girl in room 303. His investigation reveals that his son isn't, but the girl's boy friend thinks Leon is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?262061</url></doc>
