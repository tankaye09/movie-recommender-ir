<plot>The Age of Innocence is a gender-reversed political teenage comedy that threads in the cult of initiation. KOSTA, GAVRILO and SVETA are seventeen year old Belgrade schoolboys who take a vow of chastity after a drunken spree in a rock club. Kosta vows virginity because he wants to wait for the love of his life to return from the student exchange in the US; Gavrilo vows because he is an aspiring filmmaker so he wants to be a virgin till 25 so he could commit guilt to celluloid like Hitchcock did; and Sveta vows just because he had nothing else to do. The sex-starved women that surround them fight back by plotting a bet where the one who deflowers, at least, one of the boys wins. And yet, the girls are just a segment of their everyday struggles since our heroes also try to position themselves in the hectic climate of Serbian politics. They are about to legally come of age and their sights are set on the upcoming Presidential Elections where their votes will count for the first time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134458</url></doc>
