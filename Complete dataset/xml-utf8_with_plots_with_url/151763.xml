<plot>This is a good one. A beautiful young lady observes a crowd in the distance and, seizing her opera glasses, scans the crowd over to see if her lover is among them. Catching his eye, she beckons for him to approach, and he quickly avails himself of the opportunity to talk to his sweetheart. Forgetting that they are watched, they bill and coo, and, becoming excited, she draws him up over the balcony on which she is resting and they both disappear from view.
