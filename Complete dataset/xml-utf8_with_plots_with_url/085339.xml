<plot>Buck Wild is living life as it comes. However, when he gets fired and kicked out of his apartment, he's forced to ask a favor from his ex-wife Tracy Duff. He needs to sleep on her lawn in his tent, although he is mindful of what she thinks of him as she knows that he still wants her back in his life. In order for him to win Tracy back, he's got to clean his act up and show her that he is a better man than the one she left. He rejects an offer to work at a discount clothing store where his 20-year old best friend, Hank, works at. However, he relies heavily on his daily purchase of scratch tickets at the local convenience store. On one particular day, during his routine runs to the store, he witnesses a kidnapping. His first instincts propel him to follow the perpetrators. His lack of decision-making leads him to converse with Hank about the situation. Hank suggests that he blackmail them, making Buck push over the first domino in the line of trouble he is about to get himself into.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085339</url></doc>
