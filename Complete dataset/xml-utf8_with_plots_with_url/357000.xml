<plot>In 1851, rabbinical scholar and clothier Simon Lazarus emigrated from Prussia to start a tailor shop in Columbus, Ohio. Since then, generations of central Ohioans have shopped, dined, worked, learned the retail trade, took etiquette and modeling classes, gotten their first haircut, sat on Santa's lap, listened to live entertainment, and even met their future spouses in the downtown department store run by the Lazarus family. For decades, Lazarus was THE place to shop in Columbus. The Lazarus family pioneered such progressive retail business practices as the use of the term "associates" for their employees, and a very liberal returns policy. But by the 1960s, the days of the huge central-city department stores were numbered as the city and its people grew outward to the suburbs. So in August 2004, the downtown Lazarus store closed its doors after 153 years. This documentary features many former customers and associates of the downtown store, who share their fond memories of the place which formed such a big part of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357000</url></doc>
