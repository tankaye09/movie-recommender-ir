<plot>It's early on a June morning, and radio station KCEH, which seems to play little else besides "The Macarena," says the day is already a scorcher and traffic is Hell. The radio wakes Nathan, asleep next to his wife. He checks his son, sleeping in a crib, and then he begins his toilet. He's freaked out to discover that numbers are carved into his head, near his right ear. The numbers 665. His wife wants to stay asleep, so he calls his mother for advice. She casually drops a bomb, and lots of things begin to dawn on Nathan. Where is he? Who is he? Why is he here? His infant son helps him figure it out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006543</url></doc>
