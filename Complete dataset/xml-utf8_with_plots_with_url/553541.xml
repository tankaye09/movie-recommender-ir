<plot>When young professional Damon (Jason Crile) is thrown out of his home by his wife, he moves into the bachelor pad of his unsavory step-brother Jamie (Mike Hull), Jamie's friend Rob (Tim Hallacy), and unofficial roommate Casey (Mac Welch). Devastated by his break-up and naïve to the wilder side of 90s-style courtship, the potential divorcé is shocked by the sexual gamesmanship of misogynistic Rob (who has a dangerous taste for younger girls) and adulterous Jamie (who cheats on his near-perfect girlfriend to avoid working out their problems), and finds himself the object of a high-stakes game of chicken that no one can win.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553541</url></doc>
