<plot>A woman in West Newton, Mass had some plastic flamingos in her yard. She got a letter that purported to speak for her neighbors, saying that he display was too much for this conservative Boston suburb. The lady asked her neighbors, and they said the birds were cute. Some of them asked if they could have some of her birds in their yard. Ultimately, the birds spread through out the city of Newton, and it brought dozens of neighbors together, much to their betterment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434871</url></doc>
