<plot>Vishal (Rishi Kapoor) comes from a wealthy Hindu family. His father is well known Chandraprakash Singh (Amrish Puri), and his mom is a housewife, Sharda (Asha Parekh). Vishal falls in love with a young Catholic girl, Ruby Miranda (Farha). While Ruby's dad (Alok Nath) approves of the marriage, Chandraprakash does not, and will not even hear of his son marrying someone not of equal status in wealth, leave alone a different religion. He is all the more enraged when he learns that Vishal is not really his son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?228086</url></doc>
