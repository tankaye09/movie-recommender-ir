<plot>An attempt to make a visual poem using stop motion animation. I f a person was to disappear we could still tell a lot about her from objects she left behind. These artifacts become a physical representation of memories and identity, both person and social. We may not directly share the same memories but we can share the same artifacts. These artifacts are not only such personal belongings as photographs and letters, but also the commercial objects we accumulate and become attached to. Shared artifacts connect us. Made entirely of still pictures from a DSLR camera, with no video used</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273733</url></doc>
