<plot>A tramp enters a large reception room just as a party of girls are descending a staircase backwards with mirrors in their hands to see their future husbands. One of the girl's mirrors brings the tramp into view and she immediately seizes and embraces him. Discovering her mistake she ejects the tramp from the room. The girls then commence their Hallowe'en games, such as biting the swinging apple, ducking for the ring in a pan of flour and ducking for apples in a tub of water. The climax of this picture is reached when a fresh young man, who has been watching their stunts, is discovered by the girls. They throw him bodily into the tub of water and empty pans of flour over him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227895</url></doc>
