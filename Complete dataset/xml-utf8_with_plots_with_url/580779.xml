<plot>"The Other Hollywood" is an in depth documentary of the adult film industry in the San Fernando Valley shot by young, award winning director Anders Dalgaard. It is both a profile of participants as well as an overview of the expanding business of adult films through the last decade. In most peoples imaginations pornography hasn't evolved past the 16mm peep shows and seedy counter culture that defined it almost two decades ago. Yet the reality of the business is a new type of corporate culture with multi millionaire studio heads, international distribution networks, well funded government lobbyist groups and an annual revenue far beyond that of their mainstream Hollywood counter parts. Whether we like to admit it or not, adult films no longer survive on the raincoat crowds of the 70's but in the VCR's of everyday Americans. It is partly for this reason that the adult film industry decided to finally open it's doors and discuss exclusively with Anders' crew how it is to work in an industry that is supported by a society that openly feels a need to condemn. In this regard, the documentaries journey into the Adult Film industry is also a journey into the American cultural psyche, using Pornography as a sort of microcosmic reflection of American attitudes surrounding sex.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580779</url></doc>
