<plot>Girls. Money. Neon. One could say the import car scene has gone the way of Hollywood: cram as much eye-candy in as possible, plaster a scantily-clad girl on the cover and hope for the "bling." Ditching hype in exchange for integrity, dubbed redefines the automotive documentary by exploring the honest world of euro-car tuning. Working together to maintain and improve, the VW enthusiast culture revels in turning once "grocery-getter" sports coupes into exotic-killers. Dubbed compliments reverent and unapologetic interviews with unadulterated cinematography composed by VW enthusiasts and student filmmakers. Following the experiences of a grass-roots race car driver, a die-hard enthusiast couple and a former show-winning tour guide, dubbed covers the joys, laughs, struggles, and heart-felt losses sustained by this disenchanting yet steadfastly supported sub-culture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161300</url></doc>
