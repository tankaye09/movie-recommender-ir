<plot>Ross Daniels, a disillusioned young writer, is having trouble finding direction in life. Estranged from his family and finding no success with his writing, the only thing he has going for him is a dead-end job writing obituaries for a local newspaper. But that all changes one morning when he is called into his editor's office and introduced to an elderly couple, a Mr. and Mrs. Givens, who have come to place a complaint. The newspaper printed an obituary for Mr. Givens, one that Daniels had written. When Daniels admits that for the last couple of months he has not been doing his job properly, he is fired. Although Daniels is not upset about loosing his job, there is still one question that bothers him: who called in the obit? Daniels attempts to get to the bottom of this, as well as to the root of his troubles, when he accepts a lunch invitation from Mr. Givens, the very man he unknowingly sentenced to death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377771</url></doc>
