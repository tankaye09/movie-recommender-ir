<plot>Donut Girls, Donut Dollies - whatever the popular title, they all refer to the Red Cross Recreational Workers: girls from mostly well-to-do families who left the security of American shores to share some of the comforts of home in war-torn Europe. From washing their uniforms in gasoline to rushing wounded soldiers off the battlefield to nearby M*A*S*H units, Tempest is documenting the never-before-told stories of these courageous young women who served their country in a very different way throughout World War II's European battlefronts. Featured will be interviews from real-life Dollies from across the country as well as the GI's who enjoyed the coffee and donuts and "dreams of a pretty face." Production note: One interviewee, Ms. Janet Blair, is being honored by the French government during the upcoming celebrations of the 60th Anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. Tempest has been invited to film the ceremonies as well as the re-enactment of the invasion of Normandy as an exciting addition to this documentary feature</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?372240</url></doc>
