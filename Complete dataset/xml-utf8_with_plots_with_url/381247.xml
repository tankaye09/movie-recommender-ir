<plot>After the unexpected and early death of the mother of the young Mulligan brothers, Daniel, Jacob and Samuel, they go their seperate ways and consequently learn to deal with life in different ways. But when their father dies, the three brothers must return to their childhood home to settle his will. The brothers then discover much to their surprise, that their father, who they thought was a simple farmer, had a secret, and was actually a very wealthy man. While, with the pragmatic help of their fathers lawyer, trying to come to a unanimous decision about how to handle this revelation, the vastly different personalities of three brothers rise to the surface and consequently into conflict with each other, ultimately leading the brothers down a self destructive path towards their own demise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381247</url></doc>
