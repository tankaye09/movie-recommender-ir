<plot>Alien Gods is a one hour documentary that explores the theory that life on Earth may have been created by Extraterrestrials. It is a documentary that explores the ever popular UFO issue, but with twist. Alien Gods starts with the examination of ancient artifacts and religious manuscripts for some sign of evidence that can prove alien intervention. In addition, Alien Gods explores the religious cults that firmly believe this theory. Within this documentary is an intimate interview with "Rael," the leader of the Raelian Movement, who has recently claimed the creation of the first human clone. Rael discusses his beliefs on cloning and speaks of how he visited an alien planet with the Elohim, who he believes are the creators of all life on Earth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030091</url></doc>
