<plot>After witnessing the murders of her mother and sister when she was a small child, Laura Carpenter thought the worst part of her life was behind her...she was wrong. As a successful artist, she harbors the memories of a dark and painful past until one day she is catapulted into the paranormal world of astral projection traveling through time and space, to destinations that are chosen and some that are not; places of beauty that slowly transform to places of horror... of crime scenes... before, during and after. Hold on to your soul as we follow the mayhem of a deranged killer, who soon senses Laura's presence and launches a cinematic journey in the dimension of the unknown. .</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446063</url></doc>
