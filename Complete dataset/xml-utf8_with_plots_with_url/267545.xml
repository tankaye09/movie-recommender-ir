<plot>Into The Light is a story about a family trying to cope with crisis. Jack, the father, is suffering from increasingly regular attacks of blindness. He is losing his sight and his faith in life along with it. His young daughter Bella, meanwhile, firmly believes her family is protected by fairies. Embittered by his growing weakness, Jack scathingly lashes out at his daughter's innocent beliefs, bringing her fantasy world crashing down and embarrassing her in front of the whole family. The next morning he finds out that Bella has run away; she has gone searching for her vanished fairies. Without hesitation Jack heads into the forest. Desperate with remorse he searches everywhere for Bella until struck down by another attack. And in his darkest hour Jack needs to rediscover his faith in order to find his daughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267545</url></doc>
