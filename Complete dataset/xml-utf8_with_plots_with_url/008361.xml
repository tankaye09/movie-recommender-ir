<plot>Nathan Gotsch's award-winning documentary, A Change of Plans, introduces the audience to Ken Loechner, a freshman student at Ball State University who has just been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor. Told he has only "four or five years to live," Loechner reveals how this news has shifted his priorities and given him a new perspective from which to view life. He speaks of the myriad of emotions that he has been forced to grapple with, and in the end he emerges not only with a new zest for life, but a challenge to make an impact on the lives of others.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008361</url></doc>
