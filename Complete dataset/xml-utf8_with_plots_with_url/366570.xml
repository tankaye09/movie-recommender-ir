<plot>Once upon a time there was a man who didn't believe in Santa Claus. On Xmas Eve he's watching TV in a small house in the wood. He hates Santa Claus because he thinks that Santa is the incarnation of consumerism. While the food is going out and the coldness of the night clasps the man with her iced fingers, outside a shadow is moving through the trees. The man hears some sounds coming from outside. He goes out to see what's going on but he finds nothing, except a Xmas hat. But in the house he'll find his owner. The following massacre will solve all his trouble, from the food to the coldness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366570</url></doc>
