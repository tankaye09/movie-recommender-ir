<plot>It is one week since Meadowdale's run-in with The Chartreuse Men, and he is broke. Just when it seems all hope is lost, salvation enters his office in the form of one Miss Victoria Urstaring. Now, Meadowdale is back on his feet and after the missing case of bourbon and the mysterious "Malted Eagle" statue. The Detective is lead down a "string" of paths, and in the process, is framed for murder! It's a case only our hero can solve...or rather, stumble upon and in the end, Cupid's arrow is more involved than Meadowdale is prepared for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430363</url></doc>
