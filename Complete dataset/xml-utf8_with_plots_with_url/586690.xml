<plot>The sign painter is painting the words "To Let" on a large sign which projects over the sidewalk. A bicycle rider collides with the stepladder. Here there occurs a mix-up that is laughable and the unexpected happens. The stepladder suddenly rights itself and the painter springs backwards on the top round of the ladder, and by rubbing his brush over the letters he has just made, causes them to be removed one by one. He then dismounts from the ladder, and, walking backwards up the street, a barrel and other material which he placed upon the ground when he first came into the picture jump from the ground upon his shoulders, and he walks out of the picture backwards. This picture is of a very humorous nature and at the same time keeps the audience guessing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586690</url></doc>
