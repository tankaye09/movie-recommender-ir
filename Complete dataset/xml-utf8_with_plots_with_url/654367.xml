<plot>The true story of three Native American sisters who fought the government with guns, axes and the law to protect their ancestors burial grounds. The Conley sisters gave punches, swung axes, fired guns, and used the law to fight off U.S. troops, police, construction workers, mob thugs, corrupt business men and crooked politicians for several decades to defend their Native American sacred burial ground. Their Native American fight for honor and respect of the law continues today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654367</url></doc>
