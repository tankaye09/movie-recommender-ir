<plot>Joe and his friend Bob want to break into show business so they take on fake names - the Reece Brothers - and get a job performing at a movie theater between features. Turns out to be the job from hell: they're the only act, the proprietor has them doing more than 15 shows a day, the ham sandwiches he provides have bugs, and the audience and applause are scant. Their act consists of light singing and dancing. Is there a silver lining anywhere? They repair to a hotel for the night, where the there's a rude awakening, which they take in stride.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?563431</url></doc>
