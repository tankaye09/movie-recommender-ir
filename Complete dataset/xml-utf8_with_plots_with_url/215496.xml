<plot>When Ben invites Girl 23 round for a pizza and a movie, he has an ulterior motive; to dump her and move on to Girl 24. After all, the relationship has been going on far too long - at least five weeks - time to move on. Nothing personal. All he has to do is stick to his 'mission objective'. But somehow things don't go according to plan. She just won't take the hint. In fact, she seems set on hanging around - but for how long? A long-term serious relationship is the last thing Ben wants, isn't it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215496</url></doc>
