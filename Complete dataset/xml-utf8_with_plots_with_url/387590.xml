<plot>Snow is falling in a deserted street as a woman enters with her child, urging her intoxicated husband to return home. A little matchboy passes and offers the man a box of lights, but is driven by him from the scene. The bully knocks his wife down in the snow, and then staggers off. He is however foiled by the boy, who rushes on with his head down, into the man, and both roll over. The boy jumps up, and shouts to a policeman, who takes the man into custody, as a Salvation lassie and her masculine helper enter the scene and assist the fallen woman and her child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?387590</url></doc>
