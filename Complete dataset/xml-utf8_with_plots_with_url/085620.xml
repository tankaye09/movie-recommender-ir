In order to teach her a lesson, Rajabahadur appoints Allahabad-based Shyam Kumar Saxena, who turns on his charm, and both fall in love with each other much to the delight of Rajabahadur who quickly arranges their marriage. While Shyam returns home to inform his wheelchair-bound sister, Beena, and widowed stepmother, Rajabahadur and Shanta prepare for the marriage.
