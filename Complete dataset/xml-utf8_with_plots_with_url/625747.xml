<plot>This is a picture of the Hazelton, Penna., Post, G. A. R., every man carrying a tri-colored umbrella (red, white and blue). It makes a beautiful effect as the old soldiers march along twirling their umbrellas. It also shows them as they salute the commander-in-chief as they pass the reviewing stand. This picture will cause great outbursts of applause.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?625747</url></doc>
