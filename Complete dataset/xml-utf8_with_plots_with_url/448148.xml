<plot>Mr. Punch was a national celebrity - an icon of his time. With his wife Judy, the policeman and the croc in tow, Mr. Punch's traveling troupe toured the British seaside wowing children and adults alike. But times change and there's no place in the modern world for the unreconstructed male. Following a battle with alcoholism and rage issues, Mr. Punch has hit an all time low. Judy has left him for another man, work is in short supply, and the ever fickle viewing public have all but forgotten he ever existed. Soon Mr. Punch descends into a self-destructive spell of drunken melancholy. And after a run in with the law, he lands himself in one of Britain's most notorious maximum security prisons. But it is here, in those darkest moments, that Punch searches his soul and rediscovers the man he once was.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?448148</url></doc>
