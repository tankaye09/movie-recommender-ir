<plot>SEQUENCE/SECUENCIA is a short docudrama which illustrates how our behavior towards the world is dictated by our memories. Here we see a Hispanic immigrant, NYC painter in her late 20s who has no real sense of stability and harbors issues of abandonment due to her relocation as a child, her abusive father and the loss of a lover. In one day, on both conscious and subconscious levels, she associates objects and movements, as passive as they initially seem, with specific key moments in her past. Her daily back-and-forth not only becomes habitual, but she also begins to interact with her past. Her contribution to the 'real world' and the only true method she has of distinguishing the past from the present is her Art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?486502</url></doc>
