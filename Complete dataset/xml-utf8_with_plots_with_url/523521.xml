<plot>Ben Rubaye is a Rwandan living in London. He works the night shift cleaning offices, and one night his Boss introduces him to a new immigrant, Theo. As Ben show Theo to the house they will share with other Africans, he realises that Theo comes from a similarly traumatic past; he is from Darfur and his family is missing. Ben's own memories are jolted into the present, disrupting his work and psyche as he struggles to forget his past. The Rwandan genocide of 1994 is never far away in his mind. But perhaps there is a potential for recovery, through building friendship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523521</url></doc>
