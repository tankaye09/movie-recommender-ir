<plot>They are the sites spoken of in the Scriptures, the places where Christ is said to have been born, performed miracles, endured his trials and returned to Heaven. But the destinations that draw millions of pilgrims are not necessarily what they are believed to be. IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF JESUS reveals how some of Christianity's most sacred sites--including the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre--were identified by one celebrated, dedicated and controversial figure: Empress Helena of Rome, the mother of Constantine. The four episodes in this illuminating set trace the life of Christ and the Empress's journey, which began in 4 AD. With a large retinue of soldiers, monks and scholars, and drawing on biblical texts and inspiration, Helena located everything she set out to find, including the True Cross, ordering impressive structures built to commemorate each of her discoveries. With access to the latest discoveries, IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF JESUS shows how modern archeology is both supporting and renouncing the claims made by imperial pilgrim.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263056</url></doc>
