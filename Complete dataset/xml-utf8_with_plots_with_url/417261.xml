<plot>Tarnabod is a small Hungarian village located some 120 kilometers from Budapest. In spite of the poverty, the village became very well-known in the country. Everything because of the government program - Malteser Charity Service - implementing the idea of open village. The project has been created to combat homelessness. Those who are qualified get a house in Tarnabod, garden, animals and a task connected with learning how to take care of your household. Here they are on their own, which is to show them that they can live without benefits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?417261</url></doc>
