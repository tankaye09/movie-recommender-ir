<plot>It was the time of their lives. It was perfect. Phil and his best friend Jason along with their band, Murphy's Lawn, were performing their first paying gig. And to top it off they met the two most beautiful girls, Nicole and Kate. It was their senior year and things couldn't get any better. New opportunities, unforeseen challenges and passionate relationships force them to make choices that will shape the rest of their lives. Phil's dad, a father with a heart for his son, helps Phil navigate the toughest decisions of his life. What unfolds will test their convictions, friendships... and ultimately their will to go the distance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218609</url></doc>
