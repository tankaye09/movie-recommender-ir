<plot>Five different life stories are connected by a bag of blue pills. After Elena's father has been diagnosed with a dangerous illness jeopardizing his life, Elena would do anything in her power to get the medication needed for her dad to get better. When she gets in touch with the health insurance company, she realizes that they would do anything to not uphold their obligations as a health care provider. This forces her to buy the medication at a retail price. The price of the medication would put her in an economically compromising situation. After running out of money and in desperation for her dad's health, she gets connected with a medication smuggler (Victor) who ultimately delivers the pills to her for a fraction of the cost. From the Distributor in South America, to the Pharmacist who sells the medication to Victor, who is the one that transports the pills into the USA, to the relationship of Victor and and his old-time friend (Bill) who wants to expand the business of the medication smuggling, to the desires that drive Victor to do this business, makes the dynamic of the story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076754</url></doc>
