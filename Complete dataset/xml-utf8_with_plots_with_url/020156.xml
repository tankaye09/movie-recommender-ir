<plot>Mamtaram lives a comfortable life with his only son, Suraj. Mamtaram is a miser. Period. He would do anything to procure money and wealth at any cost. And he would like Suraj to get married to a wealthy girl so that she can bring in a sizable dowry. His hopes rise sky high when he finds out that Suraj has fallen in love with a rich young woman named Roshni, the only daughter of Shakuntaladevi. However, Shakuntala is opposed to this marriage, and would like Roshni to get married to Sikander Khanna. But Roshni is adamant, until her mother proves that Suraj is not who he claims to be, but the son of a mere chauffeur, who was a former jailbird. Before Roshni could decide anything, people around them start to die - brutally killed by an unknown, and seemingly unstoppable assailant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020156</url></doc>
