<plot>With the lure of land ownership, the Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged over 600,000 people to migrate west. Among its new inhabitants were Esther Strasburger and her two sisters who settled in Simms, Montana in 1910. Sun River Homestead depicts their story - the story of women who accepted the challenges of homesteading and who forever staked a claim to the West -- and juxtaposes it with Esther Strasburger's legacy, a great-granddaughter who still lives near Simms and for whom the land and its rewards are a way of life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521351</url></doc>
