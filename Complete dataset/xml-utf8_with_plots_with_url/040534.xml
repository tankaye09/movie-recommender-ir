<plot>Sher Singh Chahal is attacked by Lalchand, leaving him paralyzed, while his wife is killed. Their son, Rajoo, and he are looked after by Pahelwan, and after recuperating, with his left arm still useless, he abducts Lalchand's son, Jagjit, and brings him up so that when he grows up he can exact vengeance from his biological father. Things go according to plan, and he is all set to humiliate Lalchand until he finds out that Rajoo has fallen in love with Sonia - the daughter of Lalchand. And it is this discovery, coupled with the fact that Jagjit may find out that he was abducted and may refuse to go along with his foster father's plan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?040534</url></doc>
