<plot>Mihai is a maths teacher from Bucharest, unhappy about the compromises that his school headmistress asks him to make. The story starts on a weekend day when Mihai and his lover, SWEETIE, go out for a picnic just to relax a bit after a very stressful week. But the day takes a different course when Sweetie runs their car over a prostitute, on a side road outside Bucharest. The two lovers fight, as Sweetie wants to cover up the accident, while Mihai, a moralist, can't accept that. Sweetie's aggressiveness wins over meek Mihai, and so they decide to hide the woman's corpse in the forest. The prostitute, however, turns out to be not that badly hurt and recovers. The two dodge, pretending they had found her hurt, and Ana, the hooker, invites herself to the picnic. Ana gradually gets into the couple's life, aggressing Sweetie, warming up to Mihai and being indifferent when they are all together. While meaning well, she lies and manipulates them - but then anyone can see that Ana, even if not really mad, is a bit of a loony. This unveils the two lovers' temper- and couple-related problems, the fact that Sweetie is married to another man and Mihai - a lover anguished by a relationship he'd like to legitimate. Last but not least, Mihai thinks Ana is interesting and sensual, while Sweetie becomes jealous and possessive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430086</url></doc>
