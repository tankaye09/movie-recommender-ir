<plot>An excellent lifelike picture of the only man who ever successfully swam through the lower Whirlpool Rapids. Shows Mr. Carlysle D. Graham being rubbed down by his assistants and the cork life belts being adjusted. He steps on a flat rock on the American side of the Whirlpool, and slips into the current and starts on his thrilling swim to Lewiston. Shows the swimmer until he passed out of the field of the camera.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?094583</url></doc>
