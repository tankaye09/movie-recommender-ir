<plot>Remember that New Years resolution you made a few months back? That's okay. We all know you got sick of it and gave up somewhere in the middle of February. "One Year Later" is a film that follows three young men as they attempt to accomplish their newly set goals in the span of a year. Will enough money be saved to buy that new car? Will that special someone finally materialize? Or will chaos ensue as three lives smash together following a year of complete mayhem? Through their story, "One Year Later" demonstrates the dichotomy of providence and preparation in a comical setting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412864</url></doc>
