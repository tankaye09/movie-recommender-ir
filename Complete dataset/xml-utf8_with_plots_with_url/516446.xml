<plot>Daniel Martin gets pulled over for running a stop sign. When the policeman takes his license he realizes that the man he just pulled over was the bully from elementary school all the way through high school. He arrests Daniel and instead of taking him to jail he takes him to a private garage where he is fixing up a car. He then proceeds to inflict unimaginable torture on Daniel as his revenge. Daniel then has to try to appeal to the officer's sense of decency and humanity to be let go. We soon find out what recently happened to the police officer that has caused him to go over the edge. A suspenseful psycho-thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516446</url></doc>
