<plot>Jerome is stuck. Stuck in a dead-end, underpaying job, stuck in a cubicle next to an obnoxious, unqualified co-worker, and stuck in an office romance that is getting him nowhere. Promotions come and go, and Jerome remains stuck in his unfulfilled position. Somewhere, at the end of all this work and monotony, lies something greater, Jerome keeps telling himself. But as each day goes by, Jerome slips deeper into depression and desperation, constantly at his real purpose. Frustrated and unfulfilled, Jerome hops in his truck and begins traveling west - away from the world that had left him miserable day after day. He's on a mission to discover how much more there is to life. Deep in the mountains of New Mexico, Jerome meets the mystical mountain climber, Thomas who may hold the key to Jerome's salvation. Thomas promises Jerome the revelations he seeks, but only if he can survive the climb.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275821</url></doc>
