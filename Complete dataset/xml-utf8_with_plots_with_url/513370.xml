<plot>Dev Kumar Verma (Kumar Gaurav) comes from a middle-class family and must find employment to support his dad (A.K. Hangal) and mom (Dina Pathak). Dev, however, has set his mind upon becoming a music sensation like Elvis Presley. He loses his job because of this, and refuses to work until and unless he gets a job to his liking, much to the dismay of his parents and his brother, Shiv Kumar (Raj Kiran). Dev does get employment at Charlie's Disco, where he meets with Maya (Rati Agnihotri) and falls in love with her. When Charlie's Disco's competitor, Rana, (Saeed Jaffrey) finds out about Dev, he wants to hire Dev, but Dev decides to continue to work with Charlie's Disco, as a result Dev and Charlie (Ravindra Kapoor) get a beating by Rana's men, and Dev is unable to sing. After recuperating, Dev is devastated to find out that Maya and Shiv Kumar are in love with each other. What impact will this have on Dev and his brother on one hand, and what of his career in music?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513370</url></doc>
