<plot>The Phantom Gunslinger is set in the town of "Tucca Flats." The peaceful life of the town is disrupted by the arrival of a gang of bandits, including Algernon, Big Sam, Cookie, and some others. The sheriff leaves town, but not before naming Bill as his successor. Bill, unfortunately, doesn't carry or even know how to use a gun, and the outlaws take over Tucca Flats. But with the help of some Indians, a suit of armor, and springs on his shoes, Bill manages to run the gang out of town. The wedding of Bill and Margie is underway when the outlaws return; Margie is kidnaped and Bill is shot and killed. He goes to heaven, and is sent back down to Earth. Back on Earth, Bill and one of the outlaws kill each other, and Bill goes back to heaven! Once more he is given back his life and sent down to Tucca Flats. This time, he is "arrested" and put in jail by outlaw Cookie, who is revealed to be a woman when she and Bill kiss. Bill escapes from jail and a general melee ensues. The outlaws, Bill, and Margie all fall into an "infernal cave" (cueva infernal), where it develops that one of the outlaws (Germán Robles) is the Devil! But an explosion sends Bill, Margie, and Cookie up to heaven.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582371</url></doc>
