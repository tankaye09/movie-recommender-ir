<plot>The film portrays all sides involved in the issues, the Military, the counter recruiting groups such as Army of None, and SAMS (Students against a Military Society.) and other groups that beliefs fall on both sides of the issues; Vets for Freedom, and Military Spouses for Change. It is our goal to ultimately force the audience to ask themselves, these, and other questions, which may not be that comfortable to answer: Do we need a military? In an all-volunteer army, how can ethical recruiting fulfill the personnel needs? Where can the line between attraction and coercion be drawn? How long can an all-volunteer military continue to function?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?643333</url></doc>
