<plot>Alex Feller is at the top of his class. He's got the girl of his dreams. His future couldn't look brighter. But unlike his privileged classmates at Juniper College, Alex is poor as dirt, and comes from a hard-working family. And when his scholarship money runs out, Alex is reduced to borrowing money from his mentor and professor, Dr. Walter Dotson. But when Irwin Marsh, a wealthy and popular (but morally bankrupt) classmate, solicits Alex to write his term paper for him for cash, Irwin simultaneously hands Alex what might be the solution to his financial problems, as Alex soon discovers that his richer and less academic classmates will pay hundreds for the same service. What starts out as a means to some "easy money" quickly spirals into a campus-wide paper mill, as word gets out about Alex's new "service." Alex soon discovers a newfound power among his peers, admiration from the beautiful female coeds who once ignored him--and a brand new sports car. But Alex is finding that his pleasures come at a price, as his relationship with his girlfriend crumbles, and all hope for a better future slips away before his eyes-after one of his clients gets caught.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019561</url></doc>
