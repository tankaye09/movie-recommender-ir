<plot>"In the end.......there is nothing?" A man suffers a fatal heart attack as he steps off a London Underground tube train and collapses on the platform. His life flashes before him as he drifts between dreams and reality, questioning what has been and what still might be. As his heart beats it's last he seeks comfort in the image of the one person who has meant most to him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418073</url></doc>
