<plot>Patrick Galloway is a former soldier turned writer and an authority on occult phenomena. In 1922 he recieves a plea for help from his old friend and former comrade in arms Jeremiah Covenant. It seems that something very strange and gruesome is happening at the Covenant estate. Believing his old friend to be exagerating, Galloway travels to the Covenant estate in Ireland. He soon realises that Jeremiah Covenant has not been exagerating at all -- quite the opposite.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?629910</url></doc>
