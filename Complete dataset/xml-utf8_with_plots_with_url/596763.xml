<plot>A fast express makes its appearance around a curve, and being unable to stop in such a short distance strikes the unfortunate hoboe and scatters his remains in every direction. The train is stopped and the train hands return to gather up the pieces. After carrying him a short distance, Weary Willie jumps up and scares the train men out of their senses. Dropping the stretcher, they make a bee-line for their train, with Weary Willie in hot pursuit. A decided hit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596763</url></doc>
