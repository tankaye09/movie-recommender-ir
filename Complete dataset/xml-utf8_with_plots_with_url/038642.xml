<plot>Raj Kumar is an honest, handsome and intelligent young man to boot. He works as a sole Trader therefore a painter by trade, but unable to earn a living, and unable to pay rent to his kind-hearted but talkative landlady, Mrs. D'sa. One day Raj finds a wallet containing money, and he returns it to the owner, Ramnath. Ramnath admires Raj and pleased with his honesty employs him to work in his office as a Receptionist. Raj meets with Ramnath's maidservant, Asha, and soon both fall in love. This all ends when Raj finds out that Asha is really Aarti, the daughter of his employer. He then alienates himself from his employer and his daughter, and looks after his ailing landlady by cooking and serving her daily meals. Unfortunately, she passes away suddenly. The police conduct a post-mortem, and as a result find out that Mrs. D'sa was poisoned. Raj became the prime suspect and is subsequently taken for questioning, and is arrested and held in a cell. Later on Raj planned a narrow escape which was successful and goes out to find evidence to prove his innocence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038642</url></doc>
