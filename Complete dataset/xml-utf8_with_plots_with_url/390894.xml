<plot>Three women collide with one common problem: they're great at their jobs but suck at their lives. There's Kat, the successful defense attorney who wears the pants in the workplace but literally forgets to wear pants before leaving the house. Or Vicky, dating site entrepreneur who can advise others on true love but can't take her own advice. And Matty, the manager of an erotic boutique who secretly doesn't practice what she preaches. In 'Just Say No,' we see Vicky's attempt to swear off men for good. From going on an exercise kick to kicking hair removal, nothing works until she literally "goes medieval" with an inventive barrier method. In 'Walk of Shame,' ace lawyer Kat loses her pride at a karaoke bar and has a drunken hook-up with Brian. Shadily sneaking out of his place the next morning, Kat realizes she doesn't remember where her car is parked - or much of the night before. She is forced to return to the scene of the crime and an irate Brian, making this a long and most painful 'Walk of Shame.'. 'The Holy Trinity' introduces Matty, the apparent 'sexpert' but actual virgin. Working as the manager of a sex boutique and bringing home men at all hours, she fools her roommates into buying her sexy identity. They never suspect that the men shuffling in and out of their apartment are really satisfying Matty's other needs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390894</url></doc>
