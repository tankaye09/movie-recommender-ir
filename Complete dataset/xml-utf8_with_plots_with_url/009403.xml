<plot>Every two years since 1999 musicians have come from far and wide to perform at The Nymagee Outback Music Festival. Once a bustling mining town, due to a drought that has cruelly gripped the farmers in the area for twelve years reducing the population to around 20 people, the previously three day festival has been reduced to just one day in 2008. Despite this and a lack of funding, prominent artists such as Neil Murray, Tonchi McIntosh, The Re-mains and a couple of hundred punters, still make the long, dry trek inland to lend their support to the township and those that dwell on the outskirts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009403</url></doc>
