Harley Dawkins finds himself in the dark parlor of a palm reader, seeking his future. What he gets is a twisted tale of jealousy, lust, rage, and hate. Rita the Evil Stepmother catches her husband Duke cheating on him with his co-worker Lydia. After catching the two of them in the act at a sleazy motel she plots a twisted revenge to pay back her husband and his daughter Neve whom she has had it out for since day one. Duke announces that his company is planning a masquerade ball for some associates, Rita suggests to make the costumes for both Neve and Lydia. Unbeknownst to Duke, what looks like a good deed is actually all part of her sick plot for revenge. Caught in the middle of this family squabble is Neve's boyfriend Harley, who dreams of one day being able to spend the rest of his life with Neve. Neve's problems at home with Rita spawn the idea that they run away and get married. Rita's plan comes to fruition on the night of the masquerade ball, when she renders Neve unconscious with a poisoned apple, and leaving Duke a note supposedly from his mistress Lydia telling him to meet her in the bedroom at midnight. Midnight comes and all hell breaks loose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036542</url></doc>
