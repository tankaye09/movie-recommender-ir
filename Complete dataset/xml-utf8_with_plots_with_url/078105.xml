<plot>Dev Gill is a tycoon who believes that he can buy the world with his money. He is smitten with Tanvi Verma, but she doesn't reciprocate his feelings. Dev gives Tanvi's father, Prem Chopra, a big business contract, making Prem very happy with the association. He is even more delighted when Dev asks Tanvi's hand in marriage. But Tanvi refuses, as she is in love with a civil engineer (Sameer Kochhar), and she marries him. But Dev still does not give up on his pursuit of Tanvi. He gives Sameer a highly paid job in his company, leaving Sameer a very happy man. But he is not aware of Dev's fixation for his wife. At a party, Dev drugs Tanvi and rapes her. In a fight between Dev and Sameer, Sameer is left crippled. Tanvi goes on to take revenge to ruin Dev. Can she do it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078105</url></doc>
