<plot>Held during the Dewey-Truman election campaign of 1948 and hosted by well-known pollster George Gallup, this program kept American TV viewers updated on the state of the campaign by providing weekly opinion poll figures taken both nationally and inside the TV studion. In addition to simply showing the numbers, this program also introduced viewers to polling methods and explained the various factors that can affect the results. The program ended in October, which means the infamous "Dewey Defeats Truman!" announcement was not made on this show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034382</url></doc>
