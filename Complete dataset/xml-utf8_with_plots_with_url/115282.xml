<plot>Tom Dexter is a hard-ass securities salesman. He makes the characters from Glen Gary Glen Ross and Boiler Room look like candy asses. He will talk you out of your life savings and then kick you when you end up on a soup line. He is ruled by the quest for green and doesn't care who gets hurt in the chase. When his tactics cross the line one too many times, he loses everything. His job, his apartment, his car, his savings -- all gone in the course of a single day. He has no more friends and his only family won't help. His fall to the street is fast and painful, and can happen to anyone. He is unprepared for a life without shelter and material goods and ill-equipped to cope. This is a wake up call for anyone who takes their life and life-style for granted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115282</url></doc>
