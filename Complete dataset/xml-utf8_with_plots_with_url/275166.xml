<plot>The value of being loyal to his master, Kakasaheb Deshmukh, was ingrained in Sakharam by his father, Jeeva, at a very young age. After Jeeva passes away, his sister, Hansa, allegedly kills herself, and the shock kills his mother, Sakharam moves in to live with the Deshmukhs, whose wife, Sharda and daughter, Chandra, treat him as a family member. Years later, Sakharam has grown up, still loyal to Kakasaheb, and very much in love with Chandra. But his loyalty will soon be tested when he comes in contact with a rebel farmer, Peera Dhaigude; the marriage of Chandra, which is being arranged with Bapurao Shetye; and the news that Hansa is still alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275166</url></doc>
