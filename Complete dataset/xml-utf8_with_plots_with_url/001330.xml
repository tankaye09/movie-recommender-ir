<plot>At twenty-five years old, the world seems pretty daunting - work, friends, love - every decision you make feels like life or death, because every decision shapes the course your life will take. At twenty-five years old, you either find the courage to pursue your dreams or make certain compromises in your career and relationships that will affect you for the next 25 years. And for six friends in Chicago, living together makes the trauma of being twenty-five years old just a little bit easier. The seven guys and girls sharing this Chicago home are caught between youth and adulthood. While some are more lost than others, each of them brings a distinct point of view about what it's like to try and find yourself in your twenties. Some dream about making it big, some dream about finding their soul-mate - and others are just trying to make it through the day. The one thing they all have in common is a vague notion that there's something more to life, but none of them are quite sure what or how to get it. Though they don't know it yet - this group of friends is living through the best time of their lives. From the creators of Once &amp; Again, thirtysomething, and My So-Called Life comes a lively drama with all the promise and angst, confidence and doubt that comes with taking your first steps into adulthood.</plot><plot>At twenty-five years old, the world seems pretty daunting - work, friends, love - every decision you make feels like life or death, because every decision shapes the course your life will take.
