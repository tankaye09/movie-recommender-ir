<plot>This is a movie that takes place back when Raj, Clam, and Lazlo first join Camp Kidney. These three mess with the rules of camp, and Edward, a platypus, hates them and tries to get them out of camp by tricking Lazlo into the woods. He comes back to camp with a bear and gets chased away and goes missing. Lazlo's new friends get worried of them, so they go to great (and terrifying) heights and thrills with a strange and crazy weasel to find Lazlo and safely bring him back to camp.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091818</url></doc>
