<plot>The New York Philharmonic performs several works in a concert at Rockefeller Center's renowned Studio 8H, made famous by Arturo Toscanini, conductor of the NBC orchestra for 17 years (1937-54). The "floating studio," which is suspended in midair by cables within the building, was built to Toscanini's specifications during his tenure at NBC, and at the time was the most acoustically perfect studio devised. During the intermission, Mehta guides a portrait of Toscanini - including clips from his televised concerts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338936</url></doc>
