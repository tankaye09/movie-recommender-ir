<plot>John Hanson (Conrad Nagel) is a bank teller and invests in stocks. He and his best friend (another bank teller) Phil Wilson (Robert Ames) live at a boarding house run by his Swedish fiance's aunt, Mrs. Larson (Bodil Rosing). While Phil lives to chase girls, John spends all his free time studying for the bar exam. He wants to be a successful lawyer and build a dream home and future for his fiance, Helga Larson (Betty Compson). But all work and no play makes John a dull boy, and Helga delights in Phil taking her out to shows to relieve her boredom. Months pass and John realizes the pal he loved stole the girl he loved! Phil reassures John he is not interested in her. John's stocks dive and threatened with financial ruin, he desperately steals ten grand to pay his broker, from the bank til of Phil's station. Police lieutenant Tom Rooney (Robert Emmett O'Connor) catches Phil leaving town with a one way ticket to Rio, trying to ditch Helga who thinks Phil will marry her. The bank examiner calls in Phil to explain the missing ten grand and John silently watches him take the bum rap and sentence. Revenge is fleeting however, as a marriage, son, home and money can't give him Helga's true love that she keeps for Phil. Five years later Phil escapes from Sing Sing and enters John and Helga's beautiful home, telling her he never intended to marry her. Hurt and double-crossed by the cad, she realizes her John the valiant lover. But is it too late? Guilt ridden, John intends to tell Rooney the truth and incriminate himself to set free Helga's true love so she can finally be happy, and officer Rooney is knocking at the front door...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?605973</url></doc>
