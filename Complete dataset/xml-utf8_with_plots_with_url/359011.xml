<plot>This provocative documentary goes beyond conservative and liberal battles over the state of the American family and address the difficult question of marriage itself. Is marriage disappearing? If so, what are the personal and social costs to children, families and communities? Has the "M" word become a subject unfit for polite company, neglected, perhaps shunned in the halls of government, academia, family-related professions and even in houses of worship? Narrated by Cokie Roberts and written by marriage and family specialist Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, the documentary is based on dozens of intimate, revealing interviews with adults and children about the complexities of their loves, hopes, disappointments and heartbreaks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?359011</url></doc>
