<plot>A party is seen fishing at a brookside. A bicycle attempts to pass them on a narrow path, but fails, and the entire party, including the wheel, are thrown overboard. An officer appears, and pulling off his coat, prepares to save the drowning one, when he suddenly stops and places his hand in the water. Finding the water wet he refuses to jump overboard, but the party is finally rescued by some men in a boat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068755</url></doc>
