<plot>Two Men &amp; Two Babies is a 52min documentary that takes audiences back into the lives of Tony Wood and Lee Matthews, one of Australia's first gay male couples to take the controversial step of creating a family through commercial surrogacy. The process of commercial surrogacy is illegal in Australia but in the United States the fertility industry is a multi billion-dollar business. Two Men and Two Babies is a follow-up to the Logie and IF Award nominated documentary, Man Made: The Story of Two Men &amp; A Baby, which explored Tony &amp; Lee's unrelenting desire to have a child, their decision to pursue commercial surrogacy, and their fraught journey to Cedar Rapids, Iowa for the birth of their son Alexander to a surrogate, Junoa.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622647</url></doc>
