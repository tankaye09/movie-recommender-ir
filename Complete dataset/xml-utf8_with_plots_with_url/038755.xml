<plot>As a class of girls begin anatomy class in the lab, three soldiers come in and shoot themselves in the head to become lab specimens. The teacher left the lab after a sudden phone call. The students, left to themselves, play with the soldiers' genitals and set one of the bodies on fire by mistake. One of them has to be the new specimen so that their grades won't be affected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038755</url></doc>
