<plot>Elmer Fudd began life as Egghead, a very different character with a voice that evoked a forgotten comedian named Joe Penner. He developed "right along with Bugs" as Leonard Maltin points out; and both characters were solidified in _Wild Hare, A (1940)_ (qv). He was voiced by Arthur Q. Bryan, who developed the characterization - which included replacing r's and l's with w's - on radio, a medium that once demanded unique voice talents. Maltin explains why Elmer's and Bugs Bunny's _Wabbit Twouble (1941)_ (qv) is his "all-time favorite cartoon" and how it is a good example of what makes Warner Bros. cartoons so great.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063952</url></doc>
