<plot>This atmospheric short follows an Unknown Resident as he wanders a murky Brooklyn avenue in search of something unknown. After putting his iPod on shuffle mode, he is accosted by a mysterious off-screen presence, who goads him in the direction of a surreal party. The Resident surveys this unusual gathering through a street level window and wanders in, encountering a chaotic array of flamboyant characters, his reality now, too, shuffled. The setting is Lynchian, the mood phantasmagoric. Revelations abound in snatches of conversation. Sociopolitical commentaries are made and refuted. Pleasure is indulged. Meanwhile, the Resident wonders exactly where he is. Does he belong here? Is this a hallucination? Both? All will be clear in time, when he, and we, the audience, surrender to Shuffle Mode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?495223</url></doc>
