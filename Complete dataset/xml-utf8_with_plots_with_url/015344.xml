<plot>"Taken from the front platform of a 'special' furnished through the courtesy of the Pennsylvania R.R. Co. Shows a beautiful panoramic view of ever changing interest. First a straight track, fine roadbed and long vista of telegraph poles. Suddenly the road curves towards the mountainside. On one hand a study of foliage; on the other a deep ravine, with a fringe of far-off blue mountains in the background. A block signal tower comes into momentary sight, as the train whizzes along, past track walkers and a gang of section hands."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015344</url></doc>
