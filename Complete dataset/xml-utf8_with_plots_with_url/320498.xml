<plot>At a Chrysler dealership, we're in day four of a contest: whoever can leave their hand on the car the longest, wins the car. Four contestants are still standing, and Don is starting to crumple: his wife and son, looking on, yell at him not to give up, to keep his hand on the car. The other three (Gene, Tracey, and Chung) allow themselves a small smile and a shared glance. Then Gene starts staring at Tracey, and with Chung looking on, Gene makes a startling declaration. Is he trying to psyche out Tracey? Has four days of standing in the sun flipped him out?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320498</url></doc>
