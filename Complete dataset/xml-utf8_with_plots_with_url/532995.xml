<plot>Grandmother Zorka, or "Baba" Zorka as she is known at home in Bulgaria has a story to share. In this documentary she graciously opens her modest home and also her heart to introduce us to her family and the overwhelming grief brought on by 8 years of unjust imprisonment, ridiculous accusations, inhumane torture and the bleakest of futures for her daughter. While working as a nurse in Libya her daughter Christiana was unjustly accused of infecting hundreds of small children with the AIDS virus. 8 years on Christiana and 4 of her co-worker countrywomen remain behind bars and are currently sentenced to death. This unjustifiable ordeal has caused Baba Zorka immense pain and endless tears, and though powerless she refuses to give up hope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?532995</url></doc>
