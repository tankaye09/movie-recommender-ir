<plot>The name is associated with Iva Toguri D'Aquino (born Ikuko Toguri, July 4, 1916, Los Angeles, California - died September 26, 2006, Chicago, Illinois), a United States citizen visiting relatives in Japan at the start of the war. Unable to leave Japan after the start of hostilities, she took work at the Japanese radio show The Zero Hour. After the war, she was investigated and released when the FBI and the U.S. Army's Counter Intelligence Corps found no evidence against her, but influential gossip columnist Walter Winchell lobbied against her. She was brought to the U.S. where she was charged and subsequently convicted of treason. In 1949, testimony led to D'Aquino being convicted of treason by the United States government. After six years, she was released and moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Chicago Tribune reporter Ron Yates identified her. On January 19, 1977, she was pardoned by U.S. President Gerald Ford, who also restored her citizenship.[1] She died in a Chicago hospital, of natural causes, on September 26, 2006 at the age of 90.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611464</url></doc>
