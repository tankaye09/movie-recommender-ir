<plot>Paint Cans and Politics is a film derived from first time director Tony Smith's desire to capture Detroit's most prolific graffiti writer, the TRDL (turtle). As Tony delves deeper into the graffiti subculture, he discovers talented young artists who risk it all to leave their mark on billboards, viaduct's, and abandoned buildings. Tony documents the story as it evolves into a political campaign fueled by the county prosecutor, aimed at incarcerating the vandals responsible for tarnishing Detroit, a city undergoing a massive rebuilding effort. Enter into the world of graffiti writers and observe first hand their effect on Detroit's comeback. Witness the conflict of art versus state at street level.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420514</url></doc>
