<plot>Mona, a young student of law in Frankfurt, Germany, is the daughter of a highly successful lawyer. Her future is planned neatly. Graduation and partnership in the family chambers. Marrying Marco (a lawyer as well) and going on a trip to Japan for their honeymoon. But then the law firm is appointed to sort out a case where the windows of a cloister church were damaged by playing children. Mona meets quite a different world and the plans her family made for her suddenly seem like a straightjacket. She decides to take a few days off and stay as a guest at the abbey. She enters a world that subsequently draws her in and leads her to question her beliefs and those of her family. When she has to decide whether she actually wants to enter the novitiate, everything comes crashing down around her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?147270</url></doc>
