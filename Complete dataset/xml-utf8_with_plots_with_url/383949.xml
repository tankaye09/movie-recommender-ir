<plot>My Frankie is an intriguing story of Emma, a five-year old girl from the Canadian Prairies and Frankie, a graffiti artist who lived in a black and white world where people didn't like colors. Emma loved Frankie. It was all magic to her that he brought colors into her world through the art of graffiti until one day he disappeared after an encounter with the police force for breaking the law.
