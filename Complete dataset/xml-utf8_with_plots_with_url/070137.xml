<plot>Originally serialized in the syndicated _Super Week_, which began this serial with the tug-of-war scene 17 minutes in, paired with the first five episodes of _Robotix_, which after the first week became _Super Sunday_, (_Jem_ and _Inhumanoids_ were also rotated in and out), this series depicts a graduate student named Jennifer pursued by goons of millionaire industrialist Adrian Ravenscroft, who hides Ponce de Leon's map to the Fountain of Youth inside Bigfoot in the midst of a stunt driving show. This forces Yank Justice and Bigfoot, Red &amp; Redder and Black Gold, and Professor D. &amp; Dilly and the Orange Blossom Special, into a cross-country trek to rendezvous with Ravenscroft at the Fountain and stop him. Ravenscroft is so powerful he can impose his will onto county sheriff's offices and get the group arrested. They are saved by Close McCall and his souped-up stunt car War Lord, so he joins the team after initial resistance the first time he tried.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070137</url></doc>
