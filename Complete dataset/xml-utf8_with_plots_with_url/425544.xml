<plot>They've traveled thousands of miles from their homelands and have left behind their families and friends. For some, it is their first time away from home. They have scrounged and saved every penny and have sacrificed a good deal to be able to pay for the airfare. They have a Passport to Canada. They are Japanese students, who have come to live and study in Canada. They come with hopes and dreams, each as unique as the individual themselves. JumpPoint Entertainment proudly presents Passport to Canada, an hour long documentary that follows the trials and tribulations of two Japanese individuals each aspiring to achieve different goals in a foreign nation called Canada. From Culture Shock to Jet-Lag, from the happiest moments, to the toughest struggles, Passport to Canada is an up close and personal examination of living life a world away from home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425544</url></doc>
