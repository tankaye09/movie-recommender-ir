<plot>Susan Barron's "Working for the Man" starts off with not the typical "bang" and screaming techno of other documentaries, but an interview with event co-founder Larry Harvey, who, along with Jerry James, Michael Mikel and John Law put their blood, sweat and tears into the creation of a small, personal event that has since attracted 30,000 people or more to the Black Rock Desert to take part in the annual Burning Man Project Festival. Throughout the film, which begins with a simple, eloquent story and progresses through meetings, the building of Black Rock City and finally the burning and clean-up of the event site, Susan allowed the story of the organization of the event to unfold.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660804</url></doc>
