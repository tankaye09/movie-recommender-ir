<plot>A documentary viewing the Lebanese Civil War, as well as it's roots and aftermath, through the eyes of an old theater. The stories of actors, directors, soldiers and civilians intersect and intertwine at the Grand Theater, giving us a vivid portrait of a city under siege. As the atrocity and absurdity of war escalates, the lines between war and theater, and between performance and reality, are blurred.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221603</url></doc>
