<plot>Documents the trials and tribulations of Doug "Tiny" Tunstall, a 4-foot-7 African American Republican on public assistance who ran for the position of Mayor of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 2006. As a former pro-wrestler, and a member of the G.O.P. in a town with a long-sitting Democrat incumbent, Tiny has a difficult time being taken seriously. But thanks in part to the nurturing of his loving father, Tiny never lets that get him down, and he makes a conscious decision to turn his differences into assets. He develops thick skin, a big mouth, and an even bigger personality. After spending nearly two decades appearing on shows like WWE Monday Night Raw and The Jerry Springer Show, Tiny decides to take a shot at politics. But, in a political system where cash is king, Tiny can't do much but get out and shake hands with the voters, until a wealthy backer comes to champion his cause. This however creates a power-struggle within the campaign as Tiny struggles to stay true to himself, despite mounting pressure to conform and appeal to a wider group of voters. The power struggle comes to a head when allegations of a bomb threat to a local radio station reportedly called in by Tiny comes to the surface. When his backer drops out, Tiny's wild behavior spirals out of control, resulting in a surprise ending on election night. A Man Among Giants is not just about politics, it's about living the American dream. In a country which is becoming increasingly diverse, its proof positive that there is change on the horizon, and it is time for the little guy to be heard.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012794</url></doc>
