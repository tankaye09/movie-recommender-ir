<plot>This is a play of an alienated man (Jerry) who cannot make any relation with any human. The only creature he can make contact with is a dog. Until he comes across Peter in the Central Park. After a long chit chat that Jerry always tells Peter that he has been to the zoo, finally Jerry suicide himself by the hand of Peter. It's a very absurd play where everyone might have their own perception about what Albee implies by Peter, Jerry and the zoo itself. But after all, I think this is the greatest play about the impact of modernism.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?672057</url></doc>
