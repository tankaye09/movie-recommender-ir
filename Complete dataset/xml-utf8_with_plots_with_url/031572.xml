<plot>Karim Khan is employed as driver for a gangster named Don, who has an accident with his car, and asks Karim to take the blame for it for a hefty sum of cash, which Karim does so, and is imprisoned. But Don does not fulfill his promise, and as a result, Karim's wife, Razia, and new-born son are left destitute. Razia complains to Police Inspector Anwar, who arrests Don and holds him in prison, pending his trial in court. When Anwar finds out that his new-born son, Iqbal, is in need of a pace-maker, which he is unable to afford, he makes a compromise with Don, who lets him have one. Iqbal undergoes surgery and a pace-maker number 786, considered lucky in Islamic faith, is attached to his tiny heart. But Don and a prostitute by the name of Banoo have other plans for Anwar, which they carry out successfully, and abduct young Iqbal, who ends up growing on the streets as an orphan named Allah Rakha. Several years later, Allah Rakha has grown up, and is friendly with a prostitute named Rani, who happens to be the daughter of Banoo. When News-reporter decides to do TV report on Rani's life, she does not realize that she has opened up a Pandora's box, that will bring the past back to life, and expose her life to danger, deceit, and possible death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031572</url></doc>
