<plot>The film is about the life and work of Mons. Angelo Roncalli, Pope John XXIII, one of the most eminent figures of the 20 c. On September 3,2000 he was beatified by the Catholic Church - it is the first stage to holiness. He will be engraved on all Christian's memory as the 'Good Pope' - the way, Italians address him to those days. The film searches to display the sources of this goodness. He was, as used to say, ' a warm friend of Bulgaria'. The film reveals his life through the decade he spent in Bulgaria (1924 - 1935), as an apostolic delegate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074104</url></doc>
