<plot>It is with difficulty that we find words to describe this astonishing picture. To the resident of the United States who has never seen any but the circus or Zoological Garden elephant, this picture is a revelation. The huge animals, apparently without guidance, pick up immense Teek wood timbers and carry them about on their tusks balancing them delicately with their trunks and piling them carefully and regularly in great stacks. Throughout all the work the elephants show the most astonishing sagacity, and inasmuch as the film is of the very finest quality photographically it will readily make a headliner for the most carefully selected programme.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?601487</url></doc>
