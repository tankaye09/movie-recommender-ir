<plot>Two teams of children play against each other in 3 games to gain points. In each episode there are 3 other games The points destine the teams' starting positions at the pyramid, the pyramid has got 10 notches in which three players of each team have to put a stick on which they hike up. The points are the starting position for the teams' first player, e.g. if team blue has gained 5 and team red has gained 3 points, team blue's first player starts at 5, team red's first player starts at 3. There are little prices for the winners. The whole game is watched by the referee Robertus Maximus.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568157</url></doc>
