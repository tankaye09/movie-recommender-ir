<plot>The opening of the United States' first Arabic language public school provoked a firestorm - and allegations that the school would teach radical Islam or even produce terrorists. As critics and the mainstream media stoked the flames in the climate of post-9/11 America, the controversy forced the school's Arab-American Muslim principal from her job. "Intifada NYC" follows the principal's struggle to get her job back, the outcry against the school, and the debate provoked about tolerance and freedom of speech.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267298</url></doc>
