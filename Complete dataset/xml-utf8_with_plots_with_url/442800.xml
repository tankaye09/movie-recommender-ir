<plot>"This film is absolutely the best that has ever been taken of so distinguished a party. President McKinley stands in full view of your audience, as well as Captain Coghlan, one of the Manila heroes. The faces are clear and distinct, and the entire picture is full of detail. It is a most beautiful subject."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442800</url></doc>
