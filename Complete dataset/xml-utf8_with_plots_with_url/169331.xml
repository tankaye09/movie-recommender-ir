<plot>Chiquilín (Raphael J. Sevilla Jr.) sells lottery tickets in the street, to help his poor mother, Lupe (Esther Fernández), who has a small stall in a street market. Lupe's still in love of with Pedro (David Silva), his lost husband and a carpenter, which she hasn't seen since 12 years ago. She tells the story about her wedding with Pedro in her native town, and how that day, Marcos (Rodolfo Acosta) harasses her, trying to gain the love of Lupe. But Lupe rejects his romantic proposals, and furious Marcos sets fire to Pedro's carpentry. Ruined Pedro decides to go to Mexico City, in order to gain some money for Lupe and a baby, Chiquilín, the son that Pedro had with another woman in the past. Despite Pedro promises to return, he never does, and Lupe adventures to go to look for him. Unfortunatelly, Pedro gets amnesia after having a fight with Marcos, who's living in the city as well. In the present time, Chiquilín's now 12-years-old and Lupe works in the market, selling groceries and birds. One day Chiquilín, who's in fact working for Marcos selling lottery tickets, meets Pedro, now with a new carpentry, but what the boy doesn't know is that his new friend is his real father.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?169331</url></doc>
