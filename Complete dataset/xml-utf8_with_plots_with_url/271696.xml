<plot>After losing his vision during a storm, Carlos lives with his sister, Maria, off of the Indian coast in a fishing village. One day a mysterious young woman, Lisa, enters their lives, followed by a mysterious man, Tony Fernandes. Maria and Tony fall in love with each other, much to the chagrin of Simon, who loves Maria and wants to marry her. Lisa then warns Maria that she has known Tony, they have had an affair together, and he had betrayed her, however, this warning has no effect on Maria. Then a gypsy palm-reader also cautions Maria that she may be headed for disaster at the hands of a stranger. The question remains: who exactly are Lisa and Tony, and what is the reason behind their presence on this fishing community; and whether or not Maria is being drawn into a web of lies and deceit at the hands of Tony?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271696</url></doc>
