<plot>This picture has made a tremendous sensation, and is remarkable in every respect. It was taken from a torpedo boat running in front of the German battleship "Odin" of the first rank. The "Odin" is running at full speed, black smoke belching from her funnels, and every battery is in action, including even the great ten-inch guns in her bow turret. This is probably the most spectacular moving picture ever made.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061306</url></doc>
