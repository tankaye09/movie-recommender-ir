<plot>Mother Divine follows Marlena, a glamorous opera singer who arrives at an abandoned hotel troubled, alone, and in need of refuge. Once checking into a room of her own, she enters a realm of fantasy that is quickly interrupted by her own reality and a peculiar need for reconciliation. After reaching out to her mother in desperation and in need of redemption, she is subsequently cast further away into a lonely and altogether desolate place with only a single path left to follow. In the end, Marlena meets her fate in the very place where her dreams once flourished.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378196</url></doc>
