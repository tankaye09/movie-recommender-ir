<plot>Hurricane Katrina caused the greatest mass migration since the dust bowl, and while leaving only took a day, rebuilding a life in a new place takes much, much longer. The short documentary Transplant: New Orleans to Texas chronicles two such uprooted women: one who is mentally and physically challenged and the other her caretaker through the state of Louisiana. After evacuating New Orleans to escape Hurricane Katrina, both struggle to form a new life in a small town in Texas. While Vonda, the caretaker, and her children are having a hard time adjusting, they are learning a lot from Tanya, her client, who has overcome all challenges to pursue selling Avon products door-to-door. Tanya, who is without a family of her own, is learning to be a part of Vonda's family. Both learn to redefine their definitions of family and home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?616138</url></doc>
