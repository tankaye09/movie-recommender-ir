<plot>On a claustrophobic small town street, a cluster of neighbors hide behind closed doors and pass the days by video taping each others' lives. A thirty-something man with the mind of a child walks the line between innocence and guilt; a college grad student writes a dissertation on voyeurs and becomes one himself in order to gather 'research'; a hermetic widower finally emerges from his darkened home after a year in solitude; a man working for an independent research organization runs into an old girlfriend and decides to spy on her and her family; and a ten year old girl innocently watches it all through the lens of her brand new video camera. What starts out as nothing more than a way to pass the time, quickly culminates in violence and betrayal. At the same time disturbing and somehow oddly familiar, Cul de Sac descends through various depths before ultimately revealing the hope in a seemingly hopeless situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?120957</url></doc>
