<plot>Tito Rivera, a psychotic undercover cop is in the process of transferring a recently captured fugitive upstate. Accompanied by his partner, they make an unexpected stop at a small cottage where three young friends are spending the weekend together. After a turbulent introduction, Spike begins to question Rivera's true motives and slowly figures out that Rivera and his partner are not who they seem to be. Matters get worse when Spike suspects his best friend of helping Rivera out and attempts to figure out a way to expose him without bringing harm to everyone involved.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502672</url></doc>
