<plot>'PARWANA' is a story of an orphan - who lives in a basti. He has one mission to help the poor people of basti - for that he does odd jobs without harming any body. One day a man called Shahtaj, who belongs to a group of Jihad freedom fighters who have taken it upon themselves to free Kashmir from the clutches of India. They are now ready to terrorize Bombay and put their plans into force, is captured by Indian Intelligence agents and held in an interrogation cell. When he is being transported to another facility, his colleagues dramatically help him escape via a helicopter. Now there is virtually no one who can stop Shahtaj and his men from carrying out terrorist attacks on Bombay during the Ganesh Visharjan day, when thousands of people converge near the beaches to immerse Bhagwan Shri Ganesh into the sea. Then a bumbling con-man and thief, who calls himself Parwana, robs the suitcase that contains the bomb. Shortly thereafter, Parwana is arrested by Police Inspector Hardev Singh Haryanvi and held for interrogation. Ironically, Hardev himself comes to the defense of Parwana and guarantees that he has nothing to do with the bomb and is not a terrorist. Then Parwana escapes, Hardev is shot and hospitalized in a critical condition, and the police have launched a manhunt for Parwana, who is now being labeled as a terrorist. In the meantime, Shahtaj and his men also group together to hunt down Parwana, who has the bomb in his possession. Looks all exits are closed for Parwana and he is all set to detonate himself with the explosive on his person.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424735</url></doc>
