<plot>Wealthy Anjali falls in love with poor Dev, both want to get married, but Anjali's family objects and instead get her married to equally wealthy Ram, who lives with his uncaring step-mother and siblings. Anjali finds out that Ram is not respected, but does not care as she does not love him. Ram continues to be affectionate toward her and his family, but Anjali cannot get Dev out of her mind. Then things change, when Ram decides to assert himself and asks his family to leave him and his wife alone. Anjali starts warming up to Ram, when Dev shows up - this Dev is not the poor Dev that Anjali once knew, this Dev is a multi-millionaire, scheming, and devious, and a Dev who will try to win Anjali over by hook or by crook.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?143890</url></doc>
