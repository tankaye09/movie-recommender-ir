<plot>This non-fiction short film is about a "graveyard" for old cars. This strange place is situated nearby Cologne, Germany. An enthusiastic collector brought many veteran cars from all over the world in his large forrest-like garden. The movie shows some of them fighting against rust while remembering the "good old days" when they were able to drive , back in the fifties. Through sound and newsreel footage, through editing and visual camera tricks, the atmosphere of these days will re-live. Engines are starting, doors are smashing, the cars are starting to remember... No actors, no dialogue - a extraordinary film with visual and rhythmic style.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261834</url></doc>
