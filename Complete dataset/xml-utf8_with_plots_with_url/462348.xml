<plot>Reward is a gripping story of three broke men trapped in a forgotten mining town in California circa 1880. Kenny Brandt, Chet Dixon and Michael Wayne James star as hapless frontiersmen at the end of their ropes trying to survive in the gritty hamlet of Cruzero. Rosa is the owner of the ramshackle cantina where the men suffer through the hot, endless days drinking and dreaming of prosperity. When escaped outlaw and murderer Ben Smoak rides into town the men quickly discover his identity and learn of the reward money being offered for his capture. Ten thousand dollar - dead or alive!! Realizing this could be their only chance at striking it big, they muster up a courageous plot to capture Smoak and split the reward. The stakes are high, and fortune means coming face-to-face with the most dangerous outlaw in the Wild West.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?462348</url></doc>
