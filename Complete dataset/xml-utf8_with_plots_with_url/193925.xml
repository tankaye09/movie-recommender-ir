<plot>16 wannabe mixed martial arts fighters battle their way out to become the Fighting Hurts champion, and win the prize of a year's fighting contract. In the biggest and best MMA reality show, respected judges Cage Rage founder Dave O'Donnell, referee Grant Waterman and fighter Neil Grove take our 16 fighters from amateurs to professionals as they train them in all aspects of the MMA world. Presented by OJ Borg, we follow the competitors from auditions in London, to the selection of the final 16, and watch as they are whittled down to the two fighters who compete in a live final to determine who will be the Fighting Hurts Champion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193925</url></doc>
