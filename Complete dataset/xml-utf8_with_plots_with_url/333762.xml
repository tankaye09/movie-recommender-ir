<plot>A beautifully acted little gem of an independent film that touches the heart, and with its gentel simplicity, reminds us that we can triumph over our past. This gritty tale of love and redemption revolves around Jack Russo (Tom Vitorino), the manager of a seedy Hollywood apartment building, who's not tied down to anyone or anything, until an unexpected letter sends him whirling back to his hometown in Pennsylvania and into the house he grew up in. Living there now is his estranged brother, Joe (Tony Savant), an ex-rival for the impossible affection of their now dead father, and Joe's wife, Cathy (Cris Mancuso), who just wants Jack on the next plane back to L.A. But Jack's on a mission - to get to the bottom of that letter. This leads him to Annie (Kim Savant), his one true love that Jack abruptly left behind five years ago to start a new life. Shocked by his sudden return, Annie gives Jack more than he bargained for, which forces him to confront his tortured past before he can move on with his future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333762</url></doc>
