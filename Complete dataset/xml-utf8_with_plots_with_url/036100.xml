<plot>Thomas is a London photographer who is weary with life and is on the search for his ideal model. When he photographs Sofia, an attractive Italian girl, he thinks that he has finally discovered his perfect photographic subject. However, his enthusiasm is shattered by the jealousy of Luciano, Sofia's Sicilian boyfriend. After Thomas and Luciano's fight, Sofia decides that she wants to give up her aspirations to be a model, and have a baby instead. Despite this setback, Thomas' enthusiasm is reawakened when a glamorous Indian girl unexpectedly turns up in his studio.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036100</url></doc>
