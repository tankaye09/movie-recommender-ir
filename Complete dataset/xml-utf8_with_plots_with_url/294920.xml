<plot>Indiana, 1984. A bespectacled trombone player is wakened by his angry girlfriend, who's tied him up and leaves him in a bed in a field. He tries to crawl away, but a boy scout and cub scout hit him with foam swords. Two skivvy-clad rockers berate him and a third helps him discard his ropes. A pippi-longstocking-haired woman tells him there's a cabin up the road where he can clean up. In the cabin, an old salt tells him about Knuckleface Jones, a man of power. Inspired, the young man leaves for home. He is resolved to do everything he's capable of. Has he become Knuckleface Jones?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294920</url></doc>
