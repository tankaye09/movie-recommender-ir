<plot>Summer time has rolled around, and your just a young kid looking for some fun and maybe even a new friend at summer camp. But what if your parent is gone fighting in Iraq? Then you're off to "Operation Purple." An exclusive summer camp run and operated by the Military for children whose parent(s) are serving in the Military. In addition to the basic camp activities: swimming, canoeing, crafts- Operation Purple will recreate "army lifestyle" conditions so that children will experience many of the same elements their parent(s) experience while deployed. From swinging on the rope course to munching on a MRE (Meals Ready to Eat)- it's clear this is not your average summer camp.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?414626</url></doc>
