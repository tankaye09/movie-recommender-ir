<plot>Tom George Kolath's film offers the audience a window into the life and love of a young Indian girl living in Queens, New York. Priyanka is due to marry in New Delhi in a traditional arranged marriage to Sanjeev. But her heart belongs to Bobby, a young American musician. Her inner and outer conflicts with her old school father, Sammy, a loving but controlling paterfamilias, collides head on with the freedom to do what her heart tells her. Stuck in the middle is her mother, Annie and brother Steve, who truly sympathize but are also conflicted by their sense of loyalty to the family culture. Finally, under pressure, Priyanka makes her "choice," and in the end discovers what she really wants..</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209443</url></doc>
