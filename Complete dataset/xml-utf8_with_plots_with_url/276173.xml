<plot>While the studio recordings of Chicago's Jesus Lizard are part of the canon of 90s indie rock, anyone who saw them knows their reputation as thee live band of that era is completely accurate. This film captures the original quartet in 1994 playing to a packed and frenzied crowd at the Rat in Boston. The band's workman like approach to their taunt, pummeling sound is contrasted by frontman David Yow's Dionysian revelry as he whips himself and the crowd into an ecstatic mess. This 2 camera shoot catches all the blood, spit and sweat of a truly killer live band at their peak.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276173</url></doc>
