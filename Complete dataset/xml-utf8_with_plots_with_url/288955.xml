<plot>Stanley is a computer expert hired by political campaigns to manipulate images and create scandals on opposing candidates. He is the best at what he does and his manipulations often become the accepted truth. But there is one past he cannot alter: his own. Stanley once did the unthinkable for love and in doing so lost Deborah, his life long obsession. Now she is back in his life to play his game and fulfill her dreams of revenge. Stanley has finally found his match, the keeper of his past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?288955</url></doc>
