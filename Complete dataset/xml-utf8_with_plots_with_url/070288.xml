<plot>A photographer takes pictures of her nude model. Soon she separates the sex from the rest of the body in her pictures. Set up, tamed, she shapes reality, she enhances it, diverting "the fetish object" from its original representation. In the beginning, ornamenting it with fake pearls and precious stones, she is setting up a form of censorship through the passive representation of the phallus. Dressed, beautified, magnified, "made art", the male organ becomes a source of sweet promises - from the coiled lustful snake, to the bejeweled object of veneration. Then, submissive, chained up, meanwhile becoming aggressive, a fetish organ takes all the place on the screen. The pictures are ready, surprising the photographer herself, fascinating her, touching her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070288</url></doc>
