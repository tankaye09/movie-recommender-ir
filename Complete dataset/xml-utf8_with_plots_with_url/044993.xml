<plot>Sue and Larry kiss passionately on her front porch one night; he asks her to marry him. The next day, they meet at the soda shop: she's glum, her parents refuse permission. Larry wants to elope; after all, they've been dating for three months, she's about to graduate from high school, and he has only two years left of college. They decide to visit Mr. Hall, the marriage counselor at a local church, to ask him to convince her parents. He walks them through Cupid's checklist: are your backgrounds similar, are you friends, do you understand marriage? Larry and Sue spend the summer living the checklist. Will they decide they are ready?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044993</url></doc>
