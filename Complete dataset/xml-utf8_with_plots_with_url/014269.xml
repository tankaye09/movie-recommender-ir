<plot>A splendid sporting picture showing the game of Hare and Hounds as it is played in England. The first part shows the pack of young athletes plunging through a swamp, the second crossing a pond, and the third, descending a steep embankment into the water. This picture is decidedly a hit of its kind, and contains many humorous features.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014269</url></doc>
