<plot>George gets a new upstairs neighbor who stops by to borrow saffron because he's cooking for a new love interest. George reluctantly loans Ron his stash of the world's most expensive spice. Later, when George cooks for his own girlfriend, Justine, she wants to know why the rice is white. It turns out that chicken with saffron rice is the key to her heart. In a "Dear John" letter she leaves on his computer, she explains that length is all about repeated themes - no yellow rice, no repeated theme, no relationship. Can George get Justine back to his bed? Can Ron help?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080086</url></doc>
