<plot>After the success of the original Ghostbusters movie an animated TV series was created, which this video-game is based on. You control a Ghostbuster, who has 10 levels full of ghosts to clear up. This is done by first shooting the ghosts using a gun, and then by using a photon beam to suck them in for storage in the backpack. Photon recharges can be collected, as can the potential for an improved shot, as well as a shield. The Ghostbusters mascot Slimer also appears as a power-up, which hovers around your character killing ghosts on contact.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585575</url></doc>
