<plot>Vijay's parents are brutally killed by a man named Babu. Vijay finds out that Babu has been arrested and is sentenced in prison for 10 years for this crime. Vijay feels that great injustice has been done, as 10 years time is insufficient, so he decides to put an end to Babu's life on his own. His search starts with jails all over India, until he finds the one housing Babu. Upon arrival, he is told that Babu has already been released, and Vijay set off to locate him. Babu contacts Vijay via the phone, and both confront each other. It is during this confrontation that Vijay finds out that Babu had been framed for his parents' murder, and that the real killer is still at large. It is now upto Vijay to either believe this story and go and look for the real killer, or just disbelief this convict and make him pay for killing his parents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491106</url></doc>
