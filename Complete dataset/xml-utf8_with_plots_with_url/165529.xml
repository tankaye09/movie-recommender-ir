<plot>L.R. Brane loves his life - his car, his apartment, his job, but especially his girlfriend, Vespa. One day while showering, Vespa runs out of shampoo. L.R. runs across the street to a convenience store to buy some more, a quick trip of no more than a few minutes. When he returns, Vespa is gone and every trace of her existence has been wiped out. L.R.'s life becomes a tortured existence as one strange event after another occurs to confirm in his mind that a conspiracy is working against his finding Vespa.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165529</url></doc>
