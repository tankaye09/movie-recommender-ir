<plot>U Got Played is an African American short film that deals with sex, comedy and "player" instincts. When Eric invites his best friend Rico over for a friendly game of spades, the stakes rise when Caprisha secretly offers Rico sex in return for money. Rico, who loves women and can't keep his eyes off his best friends girl, gladly accepts the invitation. Everything seems to be fair when Rico hands the money to Caprisha for sex. To Caprisha's surprise, Rico is a "playa that never gets played". U Got Played is a hilarious comedy that deals with everyday situations with a twist. This may be a short film, but the ending will have affects on you long after.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623767</url></doc>
