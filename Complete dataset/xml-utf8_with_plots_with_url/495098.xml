<plot>A crew of four pirates argue over who is next in line to wear the captain's hat. They draw their hands for a game of paper scissors rock. Unfortunately, one pirate has only pegs for arms, and another is missing both eyes, immediately disqualifying them from the competition. The two remaining pirates then challenge each other to an arm wrestle that lasts for days until they encounter another pirate ship. A battle ensues whereby the two remaining competitors are eliminated by cannon ball fire. The ship escapes destruction and crashes into a small island. The two disabled and disqualified pirates find a treasure chest and inside are prosthetic arms, legs, and eyeballs. Unfortunately their ship has drifted away and the pelican has taken the hat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?495098</url></doc>
