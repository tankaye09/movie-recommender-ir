<plot>A short comedy following the life of a chocolate cake addict, starting at his first experience and progressing through the stages of his addiction. A seemingly normal guy is transformed into a world of anguish and torment as his social and personal life falls apart. One by one he is isolated from friends and family. After losing his girlfriend and the onset of cake hallucinations, he decides to take up therapy. When his therapy session fails and his mom just about disowns him, he has no where else to turn and no more options to use, except for one last thing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104199</url></doc>
