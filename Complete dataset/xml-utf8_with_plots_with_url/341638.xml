<plot>Sandra and Saga, both 14 years old, write a song about how their class used to bully a girl. They perform it together with their class and we learn in more detail about how and why they bully certain pupils in their school. 13 years old Mathias explains and demonstrates how he was bullied for more than five years in his previous school. He performs his song Expression of Hate together with an old hard rock band, which has made music to his lyrics. In this documentary we also learn what teachers, principals and a reputed curator have to say about school bullying.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341638</url></doc>
