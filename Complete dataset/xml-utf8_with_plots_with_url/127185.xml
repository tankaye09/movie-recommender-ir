<plot>He may be the last man on earth. Nightmares tear at the edges of his sanity. Writer/director Douglas Schulze's DARK HEAVEN is an apocalyptic journey through desolate landscapes of lost faith and overwhelming grief. Wracked with guilt over the deaths of his beloved wife, Amanda, and their stillborn son Adam, Gabriel Goodman returns to his job hoping to calm his tortured mind with the distraction of being a city cop. But Gabe discovers the world he once knew is gone forever. In a flash of light, time stands still and Gabe is lost, alone in a world of empty streets and vacant buildings. Haunted by memories of bloody violence, Gabe is drawn to a once familiar church. There he is stalked by dark angels that seek to possess his very soul. Gabe soon encounters other unfortunate survivors who believe the end of the world has come and their only hope for salvation lies in locating the gateway to the herafter. Gabe is caught in a cosmic struggle that could reunite him with Amanda or seal the fate of his soul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127185</url></doc>
