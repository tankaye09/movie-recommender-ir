<plot>Kevin (Mark LeRoy) and Jeff (Dylan Talor), are social outcast who have recently been fired from their positions as mail-room attendants at Teitelbaum investments. Claiming they were fired for their political views, Kevin and Jeff arrive at their appointment with Mr. Teitelbaum to beg for their jobs back, only to discover that Mr. Teitelbaum is dead. From the celebrated director, Gord Rand, comes "The Nincompoops", a 35 mm film that has all the ingredients to make a great suspense thriller: two fired employees, a dead boss, a beautiful secretary and a romance novel; however escapes the predictable to become a comedy most ridiculous. the situations escalate from worse to worser as Kevin and Jeff dig themselves into extreme chaos.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579522</url></doc>
