<plot>A young girl falls in love with a cowboy known as "The Stranger". A rival for the girl's affections accuses the man of actually being a notorious criminal known as "The Killer", for whom there is a substantial reward. The sheriff arrests The Stranger, but the girl manages to get him released.
