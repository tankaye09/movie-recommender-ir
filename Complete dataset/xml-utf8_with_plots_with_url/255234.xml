<plot>10 year old Ryan is working on his bicycle one morning when a strange kid approaches him, pretending to know him very well. Ryan is confused and irritated. He vaguely remembers having an imaginary friend but doesn't want to believe it is true. Ryan's imaginary experience is so real, he cant seem to get ride of it. Later, Ryan's parents confront his drab behavior. Ryan tries to explain his situation but his eccentric mom and serendipitous dad are unable help him. All they can do is talk in circles and dance on the table.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255234</url></doc>
