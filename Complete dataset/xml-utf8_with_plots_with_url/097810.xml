<plot>2 contestants (1 a returning champion on the daily network show, 2 new ones each week on the syndicated series) compete. Seated before them in podiums lined up similar to a horse-racetrack "Starting Gate" numbered from "1" to "6" are 6 stars. Host McKrell reads a question and after which the members of the studio audience select the one celebrity they believe will answer correctly. The 2 contestants bet up to the take of $2, $5 &amp; $10 {Later from $1 to $10} (of their bankroll, initially $50) on who they believe will answer correctly. The odds of a celebrity having the correct answer are determined by the audience odds making machines (meaning, the odds for 1 celebrity might be 1:1, while for another it could be 99:1 though the odds were often misleading). Once the bets and odds were revealed, McKrell asked the celebrities for their answers. 1 of the Stars is correct, The Contestants won the money based on their bets and the odds set on the star that he or she had chosen {e.g.: $1 X 1=$1}. Otherwise, they lost the amount of their wager for a wrong answer. On occasion, contestants could double their wager on more than one celebrity (if they believed more than one had the right answer). For the day's final question, contestants were allowed to bet none, any or all of their bankroll with the odds determined by how the celebrities did during the show. All contestants kept their winnings; the day's top cash winner in the daily version became champion and returned the next day (Tomorrow What's The Program Comes back). 3-Day winners won a new car and retired undefeated after 5-Day wins. Bettors must compete before defeated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097810</url></doc>
