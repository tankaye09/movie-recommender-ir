<plot>The sixth and last of the Walter Catlett shorts made by Columbia from 1934 to 1940. Walter is returning from an ocean voyage and is met at the pier by his wife and her barely-tolerable brother Gus. A jewel thief and his moll are on board, and the girl, to escape being caught by the detectives waiting at the pier, slips the stolen necklace in Walter's coat. His wife and Gus see her snuggling up to Walter, and Gus does all he can to make Mrs. Catlett think Walter has struck up a shipboard romance. He convinces her otherwise on the car trip home, but she discovers the necklace in his pocket and thinks it is a present Walter has bought for her. The jewel thieves, who handily enough have the apartment across the hall from the Catletts, then go to work to retrieve the necklace.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075234</url></doc>
