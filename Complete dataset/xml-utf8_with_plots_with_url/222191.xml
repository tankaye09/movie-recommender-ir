<plot>Picture a cross-country road trip powered by vegetable oil in a 1981 Mercedes-Benz. Greasy Rider follows the two filmmakers, Joey Carey and JJ Beck, as they meet with fellow Greasecar drivers, friends, and critics. Interviews include Morgan Freeman who is opening up a Biodiesel plant in Mississippi. Political analyst Noam Chomsky, "You're supposed to believe we would have liberated Iraq even if its main product was pickles," appears along side Yoko Ono, "This whole world is now ruled by corporations and their greed," and Tommy Chong, "You guys figured it out. You got your little bio-car, and there you go." Additional interviews include the founders of the four major vegetable oil conversion kit companies, Greasecar, Greasel, Neoteric, and Frybrid, as they discuss the reality of vegetable oil as a fuel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222191</url></doc>
