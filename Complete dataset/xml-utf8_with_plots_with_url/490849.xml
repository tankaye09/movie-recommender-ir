<plot>Chiranjeev lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his widowed father, Kashiram, two sisters, one of who is dumb, and a younger brother. While on a trip, his friend, Mohan, falls ill due to high consumption of alcohol, and gets treated at a Ashram. This is where Chiranjeev meets with an employee, Sharada, who lives a poor lifestyle with her widowed father, Ram Sharan, and both fall in love with each other. Chiranjeev promises to get his father's permission and return to get married to her. On the way he has an accident, he does survive, is looked after by tribal people, and after several days returns to the Ashram only to get the shocking news that Sharada is now married to a very wealthy and much older male. Devastated, he returns home and gets another shock when he finds that the male Sharada has married is no other than his very own father. He gets depressed and takes to alcohol in a big way. Sharada talks him out of this, he repents, and on her insistence, gets married to Chanchal, the daughter of Hukumdas and Lajjo, who come from a wealthy background. Things then spiral out of control when Chanchal finds out that her husband and his step-mother had been in love before and may not have overcome their intimate feelings for each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?490849</url></doc>
