<plot>The scene opens at the Garde de Parre at the Paris Exposition Grounds, and shows a long stream of cars drawn by a typical French engine steaming into the station. The train comes to a stop and hundreds of doors of the European compartment cars are opened. The multitudes of people of all nationalities pour out and start with a rush for the main gate of the Exposition. This picture was secured on one of the big days at the great Paris show and an immense crowd is clearly depicted leaving the cars, some of which are double deckers and very unique in construction. This is a typical European train scene, and was secured under the most advantageous circumstances.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046133</url></doc>
