<plot>Fans of classic game shows, which aired in the 1950s and early 1960s, could enjoy their favorites again with Game Show Network's "Black and White Overnight." Each night, three classic shows -- always from the Goodson-Todman library -- aired during the two-hour programming block. Most frequently seen were reruns of _"Beat the Clock" (1950)_(qv), "I've Got a Secret" (1952)_(qv), _"Password" (1961)_(qv), _"To Tell the Truth" (1956)_(qv), _"What's My Line?" (1950)_(qv); some episodes of shows had not been seen since their original broadcasts (partly because of cigarette advertising, which has since been banned). Other shows which aired during the block included (but not limited to): _"Judge for Yourself" (1953)_(qv), _"Make the Connection" (1955)_(qv), _"Name's the Same, The" (1951)_(qv), _"Number Please" (1961)_(qv) and _"Two for the Money" (1952)_(qv).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073766</url></doc>
