<plot>As an old duke lies on his deathbed, he pleads with his son and heir to live a life worthy of the family name. But the young duke soon disregards these words, and lives a life of gambling and carousing, paid for with borrowed money. One evening, he forges his mother's signature on a check to repay his debts, then pauses in front of a set of portraits of his ancestors. When he dozes off, he dreams about what his illustrious forbears would say to him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?037552</url></doc>
