<plot>Since becoming a widower, Sam Lewis has become more cautious, safer and more disciplined in his approach to life and raising his daughter Amy; the same approach he brings to his job as DA, the same approach he employs coaching his daughter's softball team; the classic baseball "hit to right" approach. Laura, Amy's teacher, does not share Sam's philosophies on life or baseball so when Sam needs Laura's help to coach the team while he runs for Senate there are clashes but eventually, through their evolving relationship, Sam learns to relax and enjoy life, to become a better person.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241711</url></doc>
