A truce is signed between the two sides, during which Agramante treacherously sends Ang√©lique, a beautiful seductress of his retinue,to the paladin camp. Meanwhile the emperor has decided to give his daughter Aude to his brave nephew Roland but chance has it that she meets Renaud,Roland's lieutenant, first. The two young people fall in love.
