<plot>Children are the victims of rackets and violence both at school and outside school, being subjected to intimidation, aggression, theft and humiliation without a voice being raised in protest. Elsa, fourteen, has to face such violence every day. Her parents are unable to help, almost unable themselves to cope with the anxieties of their own lives. So Elsa is forced to lie, and in order to buy off her aggressors and protect herself from the worst she begins to steal. Everyone at school knows the situation, but no one dares to speak out. The law of silence, the silence of fear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?326742</url></doc>
