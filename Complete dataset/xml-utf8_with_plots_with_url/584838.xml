<plot>Popular Vancouver Mayor, Dominic Da Vinci, is hosting a Canadian mayor's conference. One of the attendees is Toronto Mayor Tom Drood. Despite being considered a political lightweight (or in reality because of it), Drood is being supported by Charles and Katherine Greenborne - newspaper moguls - as a candidate for the next federal election; they tout Drood as potential Prime Ministerial material. The support of the Greenbornes, as people who control the media, is powerful. They throw a shindig for Drood, the party where they hope to get public endorsement by Da Vinci for Drood's candidacy. Following the official party, the Greenbornes - with Drood and the Greenborne's drug addict nephew, Earl, in attendance - host a more private affair complete with drugs and sex show. The next morning, Anna Navarez, one of the domestics at the party and post-party, is found dead in her bedroom in the basement of her employer, Phyllis Whiting, a friend of the Greenborne's. With what circumstantial knowledge he has at hand, Da Vinci smells a cover-up on the Greenborne's part both about the fact of the post-party and Navarez's death. In addition, key potential witness Drood suddenly leaves town; Earl is a person unknown to the investigators; and evidence conveniently shows up implicating Navarez's former boyfriend, who was also working as a domestic at the party. Da Vinci wants to help in the investigation but he has to tread a fine line due to his public persona as a popular politician, one who has a possible eye on the Premiership.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584838</url></doc>
