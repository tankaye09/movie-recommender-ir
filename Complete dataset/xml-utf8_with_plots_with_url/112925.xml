<plot>Brent convinces his roommate Chad to help with what promises to be the ultimate Halloween party prank: they dig up an actual corpse and use it to scare their guests. The party is a great success, but now they must figure out a way of getting rid of the body.

Could the corpse have anything to do with it?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112925</url></doc>
