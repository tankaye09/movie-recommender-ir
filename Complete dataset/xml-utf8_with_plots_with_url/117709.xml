<plot>Two teams of two contestants, each of whom had been isolated in separate study chambers and kept awake for 24 hours, compete in this general knowledge quiz. During the study period, the contestants are given material to study for the show; they have 24 hours to absorb as much material as they can. Questions posed by host Elwood came from the material, which ranged from news magazines and manuals for menial tasks to joke books and medical encyclopedias. The contestants attempt to answer the questions while engaged in a variety of physical stunts, all in an attempt to drain energy and concentration from the contestants. The team leading after a series of rounds moves on to the bonus round, where they could win $10,000.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117709</url></doc>
