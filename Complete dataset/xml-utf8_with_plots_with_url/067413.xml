<plot>Looking for inspiration, a writer is lost inside his dreams, his darkest sense unlocked. In there, he is a killer. His victims are prototypes from life perhaps, and the very killings a farewell to people, life, his own fading self. A woman, also a writer, also possibly a hero in his fiction, is attracted by this world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067413</url></doc>
