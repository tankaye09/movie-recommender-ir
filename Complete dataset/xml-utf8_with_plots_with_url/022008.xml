<plot>Over dinner in a restaurant Mark, a young gay man whose former lover has died from Aids, discusses with his new partner David the pros and cons of HIV testing in their situation. Mark himself has tested negative but David refuses to take the test. The issues raised for their health and their relationship- 'What is security? What is trust? - make an interesting contribution to the AIDS debate in the early 1990's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022008</url></doc>
