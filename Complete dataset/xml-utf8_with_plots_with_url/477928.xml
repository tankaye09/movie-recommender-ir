<plot>In the Turkey of 1958, ethics and social values reflect the demands of a newly emerging society based on greed and money. A down and out singer of classical Turkish music, finds a job with a company of traveling players, touring the countryside to entertain rich farmers and merchants. The first stop is a small Anatolian town, where the singer's destiny changes. Wildly popular beyond her dreams, she rediscovers success and confidence in herself. The richest and most powerful landowner of the town is attracted to her and wants her for himself. Aided and abetted by his long standing mistress - the town's dressmaker - he makes plans for winning her over. However the singer falls in love with a smart young engineer and dreams of marrying him. The mysterious town doctor watches silently as the drama unfolds against a background of greed and small town politics.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?477928</url></doc>
