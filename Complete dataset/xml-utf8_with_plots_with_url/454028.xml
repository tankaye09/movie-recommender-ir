<plot>In a time in which all borders of ethnic, religious and cultural differences are being questioned, RAIN IS FALLING makes a connection, takes a look into a foreign world and encourages a dialogue between the worlds of strangers. RAIN IS FALLING tells the story of a solution, that comparatively abstracts the big in the small. One thing becomes clear: The devotedness and elementary relationship of love and humanity lifts up the most simple action to redemption. Intuitive images weave themselves into a poetic narrative structure. Slowness and atmosphere build up to a cinematic climax, that uncovers the small, the beauty of the simple and natural, that may bridge human as well as cultural gaps.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454028</url></doc>
