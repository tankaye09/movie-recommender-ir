<plot>A jobless machinist, Billy (David Lemoyne), tired of begging for jobs and dumpster-diving, makes a sign for help using ketchup from a fast-food joint. Everyone ignores him except Kurt (Nick Koesters), a slick, fast-talking, completely untrustworthy guy who seems like all the used-car salesmen in Ohio put together. He offers Billy a cheeseburger for washing his car. No problem. That accomplished, Kurt ups the stakes by offering Billy an option to do another errand for a steak dinner. The tasks seem innocuous, but Billy begins to show up on many security cameras, and Kurt's requests get stranger and stranger, the stakes higher and higher, until there's a final, irrevocable task. Cleveland landmarks look refreshing in this feature film, and the camera picks up other corners of the city you may have never seen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657345</url></doc>
