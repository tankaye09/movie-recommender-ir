<plot>This two hour series reveals the complete story behind multiple births, from triplets up. In separate films we discover how they come to be and what life is like for them and their families in the real, human world; how frequently they are born and why there has been such a dramatic rise in recent years. A compelling mix of cutting edge medicine, science and human drama.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522867</url></doc>
