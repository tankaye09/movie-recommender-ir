<plot>The film opens as we follow Maerd through his ordinary life and his disturbing dreams. Things begin to spiral downward after a so called friend spikes his drink with an opiate. The drug causes Maerd to convulse into a seizure, which destroys important neurotransmitters in his brain that control his sleep functions. Slowly Maerd begins to have trouble sleeping. He begins seeing a psychologist regarding the death of his childhood friend and unsettling dreams. After ten days Maerd is unable to reach a REM sleep at all. Maerd begins to hallucinate and is unable to distinguish the dream world from the real world. He tries desperately to ignore his hallucinations but they become too overwhelming for him to tolerate. Unknowingly Maerd slips into a coma and is left all alone to battle his way to consciousness. In the end Maerd is left with only one inevitable decision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152113</url></doc>
