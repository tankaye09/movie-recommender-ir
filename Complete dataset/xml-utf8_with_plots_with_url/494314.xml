<plot>Finding herself torn between a deeply po-mo kind of depressive complacence and an obsessive dependence upon her auto mechanic brother, Sara is completely incapable of living a productive life. When she tries in her naive way to reach out to her brother in an effort to find meaning in her existence, she only succeeds in pushing him further away. Short Change takes the concept of the dysfunctional family and takes the parents out of the equation, thereby pushing the brother/sister relationship to its very limits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494314</url></doc>
