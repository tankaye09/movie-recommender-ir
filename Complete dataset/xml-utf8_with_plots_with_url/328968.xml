<plot>They're back in their silliest, sexiest adventure ever. Larry teams up with Passionate Patti for a rollicking gender-bending romp through the sleazy underside of the underworld. Passionate Patti is a fledgling spy for the FBI, sent to ferret out corruption in the music industry. Larry, cult-hero of the computer age and certified fashion disaster, is auditioning hostesses for TV's syndicated steam-fest, "America's Sexiest Home Videos". But watch out! The Mob wants to get pornography off the air and back onto their balance sheet. Switch back and forth between Larry and Patti, as you help them take on organized crime, the FBI, and the Citizens Against Nearly Everything in their spiciest computer caper yet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328968</url></doc>
