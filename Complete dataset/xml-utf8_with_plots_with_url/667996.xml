<plot>After Anirudh lost his parents in a heavy rain-storm, he loses his senses and withdrew into himself in a catatonic state, and was hospitalized in a mental asylum. After 25 years, Anirudh recovers and is released with a certificate to prove that he is normal, from his discharging doctor. He travels to Bombay with a first class train ticket, and meets two fellows passengers, Paresh and Sunita. Although Paresh is Sunita's guardian, both are having an illicit affair. Anirudh finds Sunita very attractive, but she shuns him. Upon arrival in Bombay, Anirudh saves the life of a child during a riot, but is mistakenly arrested by the police, and lodged in a cell. After he is released, he goes to meet his mentor, Mohan, his wife, and daughter, Deepti, who have been paying for his treatment. Anirudh does not know that Mohan's motive for helping him was to take over ancestral property, and if necessary, get his daughter to marry him. Anirudh meets Sunita again, and this time she asks him to accompany him. She is now attracted to him and his charming childlike behavior. This angers her lovers, Mohan, and Ranjan, who want Anirudh out of the way by hook or by crook. Circumatances are building up against Anirudh, and he may possibly end up in a catatonic state as he was 25 years before.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667996</url></doc>
