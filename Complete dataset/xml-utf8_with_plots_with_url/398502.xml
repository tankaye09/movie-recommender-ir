<plot>After witnessing the death of three young girls at the hands of Bosnian Militia, war photographer Tim Brooks quits work and retires to an isolated village in rural Northumberland. There he befriends a young girl, Julie, who bears an uncanny resemblance to one of the girls he saw killed. By befriending Julie, Tim puts himself into conflict with Julie's Father, who is terrified that she'll abandon him, just the way his wife did seven years earlier. The Father, believing that Julie is still seeing Tim, gets drunk and beats Julie up. She leaves, running to Tim who gets her to safety. The next day, the Father, distraught, confronts Tim; but, Tim scares him off. Unable to deal with the situation the Father becomes convinced that Tim has abducted his daughter. Seeking revenge the Father begins to play a deadly game of cat and mouse in the woods and Tim discovers that this time he's running for his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398502</url></doc>
