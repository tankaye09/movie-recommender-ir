<plot>Papa, mamma and baby in bed. Baby cries and papa hastily dresses. Mamma is distracted and takes a huge bottle from under the pillow to fortify her nerves. Papa paces the floor until he becomes exhausted. He throws baby to the floor and a lively scrap takes place between papa and mamma. Papa takes a pitcher of water and dashes it over mamma, endeavoring to cool her anger. Mamma retaliates with a second pitcher of water and breaks the receptacle over papa's head. This is a lively one and a winner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425864</url></doc>
