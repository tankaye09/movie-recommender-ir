<plot>Roshan is a struggling artiste, and is in love with Bhavna. He proposes to her, and they get married. Roshan's main aim in marrying Bhavna, who is attractive, is to impress his clientele, one of whom makes an advance against Bhavna, resulting in Bhavna slapping him, while Roshan was flirting with Bhavna's cute sister. This client is offended, and makes it known to Roshan, and tells him that he will avenge this humiliation (Apmaan). Roshan is displeased with his wife, and severely reprimands her. The client then prepares a plan against Bhavna, which change her life forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043423</url></doc>
