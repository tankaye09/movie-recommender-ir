<plot>The story sets in UK during the 1940's. Lettie Colston is a bad tempered lady, who treats in a very rude fashion her maid and has a quite strict personality. Charmian Colston, on the contrary, is a very nice woman, but she lives obsessed with Jean Taylor, because she calls every person like that despite his husband, Godfrey Colston, tells her everyday that Taylor's in the hospital. In fact, Lattie visits almost everyday to Jean at the hospital, a very calm old lady, who shares the room with other old women, some of them living in her own world. One day, Lattie receives a mysterious phone call, with a creepy male voice speaking, telling that "remember that you have to die one day". Charmian is receiving the same phone calls as well as Godfrey. Other friends are receiving the phone calls as well, a group of old people who likes to organize social reunions, gathering together in funerals. Lattie and Charmian are too scared because of these phone calls, and they're trying to find out who might be the responsible. Nevertheless, Godfrey has a fetish obsession with woman legs and he's been unfaithful to Charmian with a younger woman, in fact, the girlfriend of an old man, whom Godfrey can't stand because he pretends to be a literary critic. A refined and attractive lady, Mrs. Mabel Pettigrew leads the group during the social events and she offers to care for Charmian at her house, having a very seductive behavior with Godfrey, when she dares to show her legs to him. However, Lattie wants to solve the phone calls mystery with the help of a kind doctor, because the culprit maybe is among them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365122</url></doc>
