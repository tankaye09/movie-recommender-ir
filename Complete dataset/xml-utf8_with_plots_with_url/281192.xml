<plot>Julian Fellowes host a re-creation of the murder of Rose Harsent who was violently killed in the home in which she worked on May 31, 1902. Rose was a housemaid and a regular attendee at Chapel. It is there that she met William Gardiner, the steward of the local church. He was married and had children but the two began spending more and more time together with Gardiner teaching her to play the organ and encouraging her to teach at Sunday school. There was a great deal of village gossip about the two, heavily promoted by one member of the community, Henry Rouse. When Rose was found to be 6 months pregnant, it only added to the heated environment and Gardiner was twice tried for her murder, but a hung jury was the result in both cases. There are several other characters, all of whom may have had a reason to kill her: her one-time fianc√©, a local delivery boy and an itinerant farm worker. Although the case was never solved, Fellowes presents his own conclusions on the identity of the murderer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281192</url></doc>
