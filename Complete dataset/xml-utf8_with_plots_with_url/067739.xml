<plot>The death of Communism in Europe brought renewed freedom for millions in the East and although homosexuality has been legalized, homophobia remains entrenched as an institutional practice in this part of the world. Previous films have documented the problems of the region. They describe a Pink Curtain in place of the Iron Curtain and show Pride marches turning to violence. But they discount homophobia in western society. False distinctions overlook how East and West can learn from each other in the struggle for equality. We forget the power and the responsibility of the EU to protect us. Sexuality and homophobia transcend nationality. Borders should therefore not allow homophobia to prevail: We must look Beyond the Pink Curtain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067739</url></doc>
