<plot>Stopping after work at a neighborhood tavern for a beer a tired businessman, John Ayres, watches Florida's Most Wanted on the bar television. He suddenly thinks he recognizes another patron as a wanted serial killer. Wide-eyed, his shock turns to terror as he realizes the patron knows he's been "made." Ayres retreats to the men's room where he calls 911. After the police arrive Ayres' fear turns to embarrassment as he learns the target of his attention is a cop. Attempting to leave the bar as quickly and quietly as possible, he's jolted by a realization that he may have been closer to the truth than he thought.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470320</url></doc>
