<plot>Brenda Robards is a high school math teacher with an excessively developed fetish about cleanliness. It has driven her husband out of her life, and threatens to leave her alone. One of her students, Laura, seems to sympathize with her plight and is probably responsible for the 'Teledate' advertisement left on her windshield one day. Her encounter in a hotel bedroom with a man she meets through this service is painfully frustrating for both of them, as her inability to accept even the slightest hint of dirt or, as she puts it: 'filth', drives them apart. Later, she seems to relent to some degree, and the movie ends on an ambiguously hopeful note.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?194519</url></doc>
