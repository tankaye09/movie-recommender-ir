<plot>In his Paris studio, Reginald Gray, the 69 year-old Irish-born painter chronicles his life and his art as he paints his latest commissioned portrait. In this celebration of skill and discipline, the tasks of making paint are no less absorbing and rewarding than the process of making a painting. Gray is internationally known as a portraitist whose subjects rarely, if ever, have been willing to sit for a portrait - Francis Bacon most notably. Fortunately, Gray's portrait of Samuel Beckett, lost or stolen in the 1960's from a Royal Academy exhibit, was rediscovered during the making of this program. Gray's stories take you on a journey both visual and emotional. From Paris to Normandy, London to Dublin, you'll get an intimate look at Reginald Gray's life and art through his own stories and the colorful opinions of his family, friends, critics and fellow artists.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459121</url></doc>
