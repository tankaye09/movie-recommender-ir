<plot>Mr. Brown loves to play poker, but he usually loses. After another losing night of cards, he promises his wife that he'll never play again, but then one of his friends helps him pretend that he is just going to club meetings on Wednesday nights. When Mrs. Brown figures out what he has been up to, she and her cousin come up with a plan that they hope will cure Mr. Brown of his poker playing once and for all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009112</url></doc>
