<plot>Wonder Dog is a side-scrolling platform game featuring a dog with a super jumping ability and powerful throwing stars. Wonder Dog has these abilities because he is not from Earth, but from the Planet K-9. When Wonder Dog was a pup, K-9 scientists sent him to Earth to escape the impending invasion from the Pitbully Armada. Now, armed with the wonder serum, Wonder Dog must fight his way back to liberate K-9 from the evil Pitbullies. This game features a variety of colorful stages, several hidden bonus rounds, and a large boss character at the end of nearly every level.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660333</url></doc>
