<plot>In the early Autumn of 1994 a 14 year old student pilot set off alone on an attempt to fly a sailplane nonstop for a distance of slightly over 2000 miles -- nearly three times as far as anyone had ever flown a sailplane before. What made her goal even more significant was that three experienced pilots had already lost their lives attempting the same flight. The most recent one was her father. She would soar the rising air currents that stream across the country and vault over the nearly unbroken chain of hills and mountains that stretch from northern New York State all the way into northern Alabama. And then would turn around and fly all the way back. For over eighteen hours she would fly so low that at any given moment she would be less than ten seconds away from ending her journey in the trees. At the time, not a single person alive believed such a journey was possible... ...except one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566114</url></doc>
