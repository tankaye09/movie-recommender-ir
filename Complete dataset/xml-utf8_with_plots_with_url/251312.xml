<plot>In the kingdom of Torras during the reign of Taskan IV, the king and his wife, Lyzothe, had prepared a fabulous banquet to honor their champion, Hype. Hype had brought the civil war to an end, and to reward him for his services, the queen presented him with a powerful sword of peace. At that very moment, a mysterious and unknown black knight made an appearance and stepped up to the king demanding the throne. Hype stepped in front of the knight attempting to confront him, but was cast aside with one swift blow. Then, the black knight, using some powerful dark magic, transformed Hype into statue before the eyes of his betrothed, Vibe, and cast him deep into the past. Hype's statue appeared in the courtyard of Gogoud's manor two hundred years earlier. Gogoud was an unexperienced magician at the time, but with friendship, loyalty and determination, the young magician becomes Hype's most trusted friend and the key to return to his own time and stop the Black Knight's evil plans.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?251312</url></doc>
