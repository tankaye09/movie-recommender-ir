<plot>Celeste is working as an assistant boys' basketball coach in a New York City high school as part of a drug rehab/probation program. She's doing a very good job of turning her life around, until one night when she's in the wrong place at the wrong time and witnesses a rape --- by her mentor, the boys' coach. There's no clear "right thing" to do --- her strong loyalty to the rapist, her antagonistic relationship with the girl involved, and her need to think of her future all cloud the issue. So Celeste puts her feelings on ice, until, in a dramatic confrontation, she is forced to take a stand.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097848</url></doc>
