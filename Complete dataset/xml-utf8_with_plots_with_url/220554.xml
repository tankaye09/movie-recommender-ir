<plot>The infamous Gorgoroth gig in Krakow, Poland (1st February 2004) finally will see the light of day! Gorgoroth, Norwegian black metal band, drew the attention of the international media in early 2004 after their show in Krakow. They were accused of "offending religious feelings" during the gig, as well as suspected of breaching Polish law concerning the protection of animal rights by using severed and impaled heads of sheep as part of their stage design. The DVD has the Krakow show as the main feature. Additionally, it include bonus video material - Live at With Full Force Festival, Leipzig, 2000, biography, discography, photo gallery, desktop images, web links, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and more!!!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220554</url></doc>
