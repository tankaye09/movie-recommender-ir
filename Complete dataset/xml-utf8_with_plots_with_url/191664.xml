<plot>Here is a film that will amuse ladies and children. Watch the big elephants being fed by their keepers, and incidentally catching peanuts and other things thrown to them by those standing around. In this picture you get an opportunity to study the huge monster better than when he is performing in the ring. Each mouthful of meat he eats would be sufficient to keep a goodsized family a whole week, with some to spare. Very interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191664</url></doc>
