<plot>Surgeon, Lemuel Gullivert, a softhearted colonial, is washed ashore an island called Sumatra (The Land of Lilliput), after a shipwreck. To his shock, Gulliver sees that the people are in inches what he is in feet. Yet for their six inch height, these little people are not short of problems that arise in the civilized world. A lunatic magician and a slimy minister influenced the Emperor of Lilliput to go to war with the neighboring kingdom of Blefscu. Gulliver needs a ship to go home and Lilliputians need his help to win the war. Things are surely not going to be easy for Gulliver! Enjoy this marvelous action adventure experience, envisaged by the indomitable Jonathan Swift, the greatest satirist of the 19th century in a magnanimous from of 3D computer animation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224704</url></doc>
