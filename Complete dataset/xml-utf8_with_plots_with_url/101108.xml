<plot>They were blood brothers. Bokser, a would-be intellectual Coloured drifter, now prisoner 83143118 on Pretoria's Death Row, was dubbed the Fantasy Killer at his trial because although he claimed to have murdered up to fifty people, there was only evidence of one and a half. And then there's Adrian - the "half" that got away - a young white college teacher who just survived the murderous attack. Now a tourist guide skilled at tourist-charm taking depleted groups of International tourists around South Africa in the explosive months before Mandela was released, Adrian starts writing to prisoner 83143118, determined to find out why he never finished the job.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101108</url></doc>
