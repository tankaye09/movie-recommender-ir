<plot>Tim Ritter is just a teenaged horror fanatic in 1985 and seizes the unusual opportunity right out of high school to write and direct a $250,000.00 feature film. That movie is TRUTH OR DARE- A CRITICAL MADNESS, which goes on to worldwide cult success over the years and is among the first of the made-for-video slasher movies, helping to pioneer a niche market and business plan that is still being used today. This documentary chronicles the trials, tribulations, ups, and downs that it took to make TRUTH OR DARE back in 1986, including on-the-set documentation of the gore effects and pyrotechnic stunts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118917</url></doc>
