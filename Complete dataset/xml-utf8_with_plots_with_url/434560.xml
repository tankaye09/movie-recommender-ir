So they accumulate enough money to travel to Bombay, and live a comfortable life there. Lucky is the card-sharp and he tries his skill with Aslambhai, and succeeds considerably. When his friends coax him to play some more, he does and not only loses everything - but owes Aslam a whooping seven lakh rupees. Since they do not have the money, Aslam gives them seven days to return the money to him or else.... The friends sit and ponder their fate, when one of them comes upon a an idea to kidnap a rich businessman, demand a hefty ransom, get the money, release the hostage, and live comfortably the rest of their lives. After some discussions, they find out that one such businessman frequents a bar every week, they accordingly chloroform him, and bring him to their hideout and tie him to a chair. When the businessman comes he tells them to check in any police station as to his identity. It is then that they find out that the person they have kidnapped is Mussabhai - a notorious underworld gangster - who is wanted by the police - and who will go to any lengths to free himself from the four, and kill them in the process.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434560</url></doc>
