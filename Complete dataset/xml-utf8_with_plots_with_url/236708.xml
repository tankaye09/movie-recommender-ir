<plot>A musical animated short film. In the year 2020, the sprawling City of Megapolis is a tangle of freeways, off-ramps, and traffic jams. On a chilly Spring morning, an elderly MS. DEMETER is saved from an onrushing SUV by HERMAN the bicycle courier as she searches the city for DANDELION seeds which she must save from MR. MEGAMORE, the richest developer in Megapolis, who is determined to destroy them. As she races through the smog-choked city, a mysterious Voice urges her on... When Herman encounters Ms. Demeter again at her Garden Gate, he is entranced by her beautiful daughter; STEPHANIE. Ms. Demeter slams the gate in Mr. Megamore's face, then kneels by the Garden Wall to witness the birth of DAISY and DANDELION. Over the traffic and the noise, the mysterious Voice proclaims a Brand New Spring.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236708</url></doc>
