<plot>What's the glue that can create a special bond between brother and sister in place of sibling rivalry? The Angry Kid sits next to his sister on the couch as she watches a children's program on TV. He's bored, so he starts to pester her. She ignores him for awhile, then she's had enough and, quick as a cat, she thrusts two fingers up his nose. What can save this situation from deteriorating into a brawl?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079787</url></doc>
