<plot>Samir's summer is looking pretty bleak. His spoiled sister is back from med school, his fresh off the boat parents get more foreign every day and it looks like he's about to lose the girl of his dreams...to his best friend. In response, Samir ditches his high school friends and starts hanging out with a couple of twenty-somethings. But as Samir exchanges his adolescent woes for a look at the quarter-life, he starts to see that the other side of twenty isn't all its cracked up to be...And that maybe being sixteen isn't so bad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384895</url></doc>
