<plot>Amy and Carrie are total opposite of roommates. Amy is a bit uptight and neurotic. Carrie is a slacker who usually forgets what time she works the next day. Amy doesn't like confrontation, so she usually lets Carrie get away with her bad habits. After a wild night of partying hosted by Carrie, Amy awakens to find the apartment trashed with Carrie stoned and hungover on the couch. And to top it off, Amy's homemade cheesecake, has been eaten by Carrie. Amy, unable to contain her frustration any longer, acts on instinct and kills Carrie. She cleans up the murder scene and puts the body in the bathtub. For the first time in a long time, Amy is much calmer now that her roommate from hell is out of the picture. That night, Amy has a dinner date in her apartment. Everything is going well, but Amy is going to find out that murder isn't always the best solution in getting rid of annoying roommates.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101443</url></doc>
