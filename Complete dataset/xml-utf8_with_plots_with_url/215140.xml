<plot>Barney O'Hara (Frank Albertson), a boxer retired from the ring because of bad eyes, settles in a small town with his nephew Chip (Johnny Calkins.) Chip adopts a stray dog he names Ginger (played by "Napoleon"), but pompous town mayor Hector Tillford (Dick Elliott), who dreams of having a town park named after him, doesn't like dogs to begin with and his feelings aren't improved after Ginger bites him. He has the dog locked up but Johnny frees him and the police are scouring the countryside looking for the pair. But the mayor's pampered son (Gene Collins) injures his leg and is rescued by Ginger, and Ginger becomes a valued member of the community.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215140</url></doc>
