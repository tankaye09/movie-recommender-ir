<plot>Among the Giants is a short documentary film that tells the story of the Adaptive Design Association. This nonprofit organization is located in New York City and builds customized equipment for kids and adults with disabilities, mainly using cardboard. The film portrays the organization's mission through the compelling stories of two fascinating individuals, a woman named Tamara Morgan and a young girl named Raven DeSayles. Tamara Morgan is a twenty-three year old woman who lives in New York City and has brittle bone disease. Being only three-foot two, she gets around in a tiny wheelchair. Tamara struggled with life in the city before finding Adaptive Design. Raven is nine years old and lives on Staten Island. With two unusable legs, Raven uses her powerful arms to move around when she is not confined to her wheelchair. Raven struggled to participate with the other students her age in school, until she found Adaptive Design. Now, both of these individuals use a variety of customized equipment built for them by Adaptive Design. Additionally, the film tells the story of how a woman named Alex Truesdell started the organization at the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, MA, and why the company eventually moved to its current home in New York City. Among The Giants causes viewers to question what it means to solve problems, be creative and impact the community all while working with cheap and easily accessible materials.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035721</url></doc>
