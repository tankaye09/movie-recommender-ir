<plot>For Love and For Life places the 1987 March on Washington in perspective among the major political events of our times. It recounts how the events were organized, and creates all the immediacy of being there. This exciting presentation explores all six days during which 650,000 lesbians, gay men and their supporters came to Washington, DC and made history. The inaugural display of the Names Project Quilt, the largest civil disobedience ever at the Supreme Court, the first community Wedding and the Harvey Milk Memorial are just some of the events highlighted from this historic March and Rally. The energy and emotions of these events are presented through the speeches and sounds of the March, a comprehensive narration, and hundreds of dramatic images.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199776</url></doc>
