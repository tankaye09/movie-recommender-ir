<plot>Maddie and Pete seem perfect for each other: she's a waitress, he's a Hibachi chef. Their obsession with food extends from the daily grind to the bedroom. But is it enough? Maddie wants more - and thinks that maybe Pete is holding her back. Carol chose a future as a professional university professor twenty years ago, yet she teaches the poetry of the man she left behind. When he turns up again, she is given another chance - but will love rekindle? Milk &amp; Honey is the story of two romances that cross paths.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370037</url></doc>
