<plot>Bill, a worker for the telephone company, is eating with his family when the woman across the hall comes to ask whether she can use Bill's phone. When she then asks Bill to come and fix her own telephone, Bill takes advantage of the chance to flirt with her, only to be discovered by her angry husband. And Bill's worries don't end there - his rent collector is looking for him, and there is also an unknown man pursuing him, with the intention of forcing Bill to accept an official-looking envelope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338830</url></doc>
