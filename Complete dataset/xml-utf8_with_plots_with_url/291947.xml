<plot>The true story of the Sandy Lake Cree and their culture clash with the Canadian criminal justice system in 1907. Charged with murder in the death of a possessed woman who had become a windigo, or man eater, shaman and community leader Jack Fiddler along with brother Joseph were considered to be heathen devil worshippers. Perhaps the most famous story surrounding the myth of the windigo, the brothers were arrested and convicted of murder by an all White jury, and sentenced to be hanged. Killing The Shamen explores the notions of law and order from opposing world views, the power of shamen navigating the spirit world,, the role of dreams and visions in traditional Native societies, and the impact of Euro-western religions, laws, and the fur trade economy...all culminating in a mythic tale of life and death</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291947</url></doc>
