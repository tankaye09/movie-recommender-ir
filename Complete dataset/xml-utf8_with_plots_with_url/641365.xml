<plot>On a warm summer night in August, two young seemingly down-to-earth individuals - Isabelle, a young woman looking for love; and Jack, a young man looking for sex -  sit together on a bed and start to kiss. Jack proceeds to rape her as she tries with all her might to fight him off. Nine months pass, Jack has returned from his first year of college at NYU, and he greets both his best friend Lisa and younger brother Charlie at home. After a brief time at home, Jack drives away and pulls over on the side of a road when he sees a prostitute smoking on a railroad. When she accepts his offer to get in the car, Jack has no idea the night he has coming.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?641365</url></doc>
