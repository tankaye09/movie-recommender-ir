<plot>At the farm, it's Milford's birthday so the family throws a party for him. Unfortunately, just as he is about to blow out the candles, he is kidnapped by a neighboring family, the "Boomer Brothers", who want to have the pig for supper. Maw and Paw make numerous attempts to rescue the pig from their clutches (including Paw dressing as Superman in a vein attempt to fly) but nothing works. Finally, Paw puts dynamite in the oven in Milford's place but has to wrestle the other Boomers for possession of Milford. Eventually, Maw and Paw triumph and Milford is saved to celebrate another birthday.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432511</url></doc>
