<plot>Inept handyman Dennis is selling his wife Vera's car, and Neil comes to buy it, except it's for his wife Pam. However, Pam would rather buy it with money of her own, which she doesn't have, because she gave up her promising career to bring up their son. Dennis, who's still in the clutches of his mother who lives with them, is driving his wife up the wall with his irritating jollity. Neil becomes friends with Dennis, giving him doubtful advice, and Vera seems close to the end of her tether, and always.... always there seems to be someone's birthday.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282178</url></doc>
