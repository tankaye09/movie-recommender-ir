<plot>Depressed at the thought of losing his family ranch to settle his divorce, cowboy Clint Brannan decides to drive his cattle up to their high pasture. One day into the drive Clint happens across actress Sean Livingston who has run her car off the road in the middle of nowhere whilst out on a drive to clear her head. Faced with the prospect of a two or three day wait for rescue or accompanying Clint on his cattle drive, Sean decides to go on the cattle drive. Completely unprepared for the harshness and privations of living outdoors Sean initially hates the adventure. However, as the drive progresses Sean and Clint start to appreciate the differences and similarities of their respective lives and begin to realize that they have much in common. As the drive progresses fate and the forces of nature intervene to turn the cattle drive into a race against time to reach their destination to save the cattle and then return to civilization as soon as possible to save Clint's life. Will their fledgling friendship, borne of enforced intimacy, survive and grow or will they go their separate ways?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550650</url></doc>
