<plot>A very excellent subject, and a beautiful piece of photography, showing a troop of mounted soldiers riding down to the banks of a river and forcing their horses to swim them across while they are mounted upon their backs. A pleasing, interesting and instructive subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378808</url></doc>
