<plot>On fleeing his cell, Philip's fate is once again set in motion. The facility he emerges into is a far cry from the barren mines that brought him here - a hi-tech research station almost devoid of human life. Philip continues on his quest to recover his father, the adventure he set out on in Penumbra: Overture, but as events unfold, he finds his ill-fated companion Red's warning ringing in his ears. This time, Philip will be accompanied by more than one voice calling from the darkness. This time, perhaps they can be trusted? Make the leap of faith. Discover the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?428396</url></doc>
