<plot>Pete and Ashley just met and it means something. However, like any new romance they face obstacles; job related (she is a drug addicted professional killer he is a drug addicted research scientist), personal history (she has killed every man she ever loved, Pete has never cared for anyone as much as the drugs), from authority figures (Pete's boss is the head scientist and also happens to be the man who hired Ashley to kill him), and friend related (Ashley just killed Pete's best friend). The odds are stacked against Pete and Ashley. To fall in love, to stay alive, and to do more drugs, will all be decided with a kiss, a kiss from Calcutta.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?293560</url></doc>
