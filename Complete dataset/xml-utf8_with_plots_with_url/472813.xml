<plot>After his first novel 'Light House' flops, wealthy, Delhi-based Akash Dev, with the help of his editor, Khanna, decides to travel to a small village, Shivpura, to meet with Gandhian Jayshankar Chaube, and write something controversial about Mahatma Gandhi. On the way, he bids adieu to his girlfriend, Komal Malhotra, whose mother, Shanti, disapproves of him, and goes on his way. Before reaching Shivpura, his jeep breaks down near Palanpur and he takes it to a nearby mechanic, who turns out to be incompetent. To makes matters worse, Akash's luggage is stolen, and he gets stranded in a town where even the phone does not work. He tries to impress everyone that he knows a lot of influential politicians in Delhi, who live in the neighborhood of Chanakyapuri, but gets caught up in a challenge to built a road, and romantically involved with the Village Mukhiya's arrestingly beautiful daughter, Akansha. Now Akash must come up with ways to live up to this challenge, and he will find that none is forthcoming, but trouble is arising on the horizon, especially when the Chief Minister finds out his intentions - and decides to teach him a bitter lesson of daring to interfere in the state's politics.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472813</url></doc>
