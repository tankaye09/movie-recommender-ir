In an effort to prove he's a worthy beau to his friend Paul's ex, Noah decides to finance a surprise romantic getaway by dogknapping. But once Paul finds out, his best friend becomes his worst enemy. Angela, the ex, is also going through a transition. She's decided to give up her silly dreams, and get a real career. Plus, a new love interest looks promising. Too bad she doesn't know it's with an ex-legbreaker.
