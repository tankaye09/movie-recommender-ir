<plot>A dead blues musician Mr. Bones, is buried in a cemetery full of criminals by mistake. The evil Da Goulian (not knowing about this) brings the entire graveyard to life. Mr. Bones is pointed out by a skeleton which is nearby and they are ordered to catch him. After just about escaping the graveyard, he finds a blind man who gives him a guitar. By using this guitar Mr. Bones is able to escape capture and wander through the forest. However a vortex sucks him into another dimension, and after several levels Mr. Bones plays his guitar to a spirit who sets him free. Mr. Bones is then thrown back into the real world, but is trapped in underwater caves. After helping the small creatures who live in the cave, in return they show him the way to Da Goulian's castle. Mr. Bones breaks in to the castle and uses his guitar in an attempt to make Da Goulian become good. This plan does not work, but eventually, the sun rises and the evil Da Goulian turns to dust.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379525</url></doc>
