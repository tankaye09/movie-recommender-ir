<plot>The raw material for this film is a collection of photos taken by a Franciscan monk in the Brazilian jungle. Keip processed the slides so that they became negatives and the negatives were processed the other way round. They were all then enlarged and reproduced in generations. This means that not only does the material become very grainy, but the wear and tear of the originals becomes clearly visible.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264363</url></doc>
