<plot>Mauchly: The Computer and the Skateboard tells the story of what happens to the inventor as the huge potential of his invention begins to dawn on those around him: From the triumphant unveiling and first successful operations of the ENIAC to the crushing blow of being stripped of the patent. Co-Directors Jim Reed, who is John Mauchly's grandson, and Paul David weave archival footage together with interviews of Mauchly's colleagues and friends to create an eclectic homage to Mauchly and a new perspective on the history of computation. It should be noted that this film contains the only available footage anywhere of John Mauchly himself speaking about the first modern computer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361431</url></doc>
