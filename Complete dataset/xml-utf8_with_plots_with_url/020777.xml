<plot>Gorgeous looking Anju Khanna lives in a palatial home with her dad, and mom. Her dad, R.K.Khanna has been having labor problems at his workplace, due to a headstrong union leader named Shanker, who wants better housing and benefits for all workers, and failing which, he has declared an indefinite strike. Her dad would like her to marry Laxmikant alias Lucky Gupta, but Anju does not like him. She has met and has fallen in love with a dashing young man named Raja Singh Rathod. Although Khanna is upset with her for falling in love, he would like to meet him, to which Anju agrees to and brings Raja along to introduce him to her dad. It is then that Khanna finds out that Raja is a poor motor mechanic, and is the brother of union leader, Shanker. He asks Raja to leave, and warns Anju that if she ever sees him again, he will arrange to have Raja killed.
