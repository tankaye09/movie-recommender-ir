<plot>Shows a number of boys bathing in a fountain on the East Side. While they are at the height of their amusement, which consists of splashing the bystanders and swimming around, a policeman suddenly appears. There is immediately a wild scramble from the fountain, the boys seizing their clothing and dashing away, almost nude, through the streets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164506</url></doc>
