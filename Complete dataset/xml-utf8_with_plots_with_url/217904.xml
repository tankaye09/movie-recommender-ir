<plot>A man named Gene was just a poor man with little money in the old west style town. When he witnessed a girl named Olivia who is being attacked my the mobs and as they were prepared to severe her right arm, Gene tries to save Olivia and as he tried to take on the mobs, he was powerless. The mobs then severed Gene's entire right arm after he was beaten by the mob. When Gene later awoke, his right arm is still there, only this time, it was a legendary limb with tremendous power of a God known as "God Hand". Using the power of his new right arm, Gene must eliminate all the mobs who are so dead-set on trying to go after the God Hand. Gene has the ability to use his right hand to perform various deadly moves, which would be powerful enough to vanquish evil led by the evil Belze who is seeking to gain the God Hand from Gene. Can Gene stop this insane situation and vanquish evil for good?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217904</url></doc>
