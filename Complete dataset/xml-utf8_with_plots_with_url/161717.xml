<plot>An Irish circus, passed down from father to son, which has performed every year since 1775, through famines, wars, and of course, plenty of rain. Run by a 7th generation Duffy, David Duffy (who refers to his young 3 year-old son as 'the eighth generation'), Duffy's Irish Circus is a one-ring circus that does everything the old fashioned way. Making its way into every tiny village and foggy bog, this circus is a remarkable relic of what show-biz used to be. Doing everything themselves (including setting up and taking down the 'big top') the characters are entertainers who have made a life out of traveling, hardships, and dreams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161717</url></doc>
