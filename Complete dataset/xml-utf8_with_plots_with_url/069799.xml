<plot>In Montana's Rocky Mountains mother bear has only a short time to teach newborn cubs the ways of the forest. Her summer camp lessons cover everything from tree climbing to trout fishing, complete with berry plucking and ant picnics. Wolves, coyotes and even other bears would like to join the cubs for dinner - with the cubs as the main course! What's more if they don't eat enough and fatten up they won't survive their seven-month hibernation. Growing up isn't easy in Big Sky Country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?069799</url></doc>
