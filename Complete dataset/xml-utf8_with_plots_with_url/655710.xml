<plot>"Why Dubai?" provides a revealing look at how this upstart emirate has transformed itself into the transportation, tourism and entrepreneurial hub of the Arabian Gulf, and what risks threaten this high-octane mix of oil wealth, ambition and imagination. Of all the world's great cities, none has made a speedier or more spectacular debut than Dubai, the supercharged metropolis that boasts the world's tallest building, biggest man-made islands, most luxurious resorts, and richest sporting events. In the space of a generation, Dubai has outpaced its neighbors and transformed itself into the transportation, tourism and entrepreneurial hub of the Arabian Gulf. Yet who is driving Dubai? How does its cosmopolitan culture express the hopes and dreams of the 150 nationalities that call it home? Will the race to complete Dubai ever reach the finish line? Where are the roadblocks? In a city known for its extravagance, what's next?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655710</url></doc>
