<plot>Jake Overstreet is a saxophone player who has reached a point in his life when he wants to start a family. The woman who he thinks is the love of his life makes porno films and is always away. He wanders the streets of San Francisco among the destitute contemplating his next move. As his sensitive inner life consumes him, the voice of his deceased mother consoles him. Jake begins to be managed by an ambitious Argentine woman who has opportunistic tendencies. As they work together to rebuild Jake's musical career, Jake falls deeper into despair.
