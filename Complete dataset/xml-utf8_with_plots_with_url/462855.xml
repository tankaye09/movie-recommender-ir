<plot>Based on the play Richard II by Shakespeare, the film is set in the 14th century England. Richard II is alienating himself from the true interests of his country. He is rising taxes because of his unwise money spending on lush life and toy wars. Richard seizes the lands and money of his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, who is favored by the people of England. Bolingbroke assembles an army of commoners and nobility, who are angry with the unwise King. Bolingbroke follows Richard in Wales and brings him back to London as a prisoner. Bolingbroke is crowned King Henry IV. He removes prisoner to a remote castle, where Richard is murdered by Exton upon King Henry's order. Exton delivers the dead Richard's body to King Henry, who now denies that he actually ordered the king's murder. To wash the guilt from his soul, King Henry vows to take a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?462855</url></doc>
