<plot>All coons like chicken. This fellow is no exception to the rule and to see the expression on his face when somebody mentioned the toothsome bird to him proves the fact conclusively. The subject is that of a darkey of immense proportions talking to the audience. The head occupies the entire screen. Incidentally the subject was that of a southern darkey, said to be 98 years of age. He has about three teeth left and they look like old fashioned tombstones. A perfect picture of facial expression.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655197</url></doc>
