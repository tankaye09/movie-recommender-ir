<plot>A most difficult piece of railroad engineering is presented, showing a trestle three hundred feet long with a tunnel through the mountain. From the tunnel, a train soon emerges, and as it grows to actual size our two operators are shown on the pilot making a moving picture of the beautiful scene that unfolds itself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?620967</url></doc>
