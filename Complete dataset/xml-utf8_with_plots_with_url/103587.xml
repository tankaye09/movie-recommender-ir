<plot>In picturesque Darjeeling lives a young singer, Shekhar, with his widowed mom, who is in love with the only daughter, Rita, of wealthy Rai Bahadur Digamberprasad Rai. Rai does not approve of Shekhar and wants his daughter to marry a wealthy Calcutta-based businessman named Chowdhry. Rita asks Shekhar to get a better position, but Shekhar is quite satisfied with his singing career. So Rita and her dad re-locate to Calcutta, and Shekhar follows them. An enraged Rai complains to the police, who arrest Shekhar and hold him for questioning. It is here that Shekhar will secure employment with the police as an undercover agent to impersonate his look-alike, a China Town gangster named Mike, who is being held by the police, but refuses to divulge any information. Shekhar accordingly takes over Mike's life, but there is one thing he and the police overlooked - namely Mike - who has escaped from police custody and is on his way back to reclaim his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103587</url></doc>
