<plot>Being raised in a middle-class Chinese family in Jakarta and educated at one of the government school with the majority of locals, for 10-year old Timmy, nationality is obviously an abstract matter, but being left out because of his different answers towards a school-form which questions 'ancestral:' is without doubt something concrete. With the help of his friends, they celebrated their own version of a Chinese new year party, and seek information about Chinese culture. Their quest, inspires us that real love and friendship comes from a great willing to understand others. Being the premise of the whole story, Timmy pursues to define where he comes from and what nationality is all about and with the help of his Java, Batak and Balinese friends, they somehow begin a journey of self-discovery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?293745</url></doc>
