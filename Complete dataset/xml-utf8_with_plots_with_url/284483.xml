She meets with Financial Executive, Aditya Chowdhury, and both fall in love with each other. They get engaged and even invest in a house. They overcome differences, which only re-surface when Radhika, who has been promoted as Bureau Chief, decides to re-locate to Mumbai, India. Once there both overcome their differences and Aditya even visits her on her birthday. Shortly thereafter Radhika visits him in London. After a short harmonious period, their differences re-surface again and both decide to part ways.
