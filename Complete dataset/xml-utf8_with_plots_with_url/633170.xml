In contrast to her younger brother, Yanne remembers their journey to Norway, but she has no idea where he might be now. All this is about to change, however, as Yanne's Polish friend Maria starts working as a maid for Axel's parents, there discovering a photograph of a young boy. Maria has seen the same picture on the wall of Yanne's flat. She decides to reunite them.
