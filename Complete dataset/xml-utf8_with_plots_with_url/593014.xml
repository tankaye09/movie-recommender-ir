<plot>The first half of this movie is comprised of episode one, "Voyage of Discovery" that opened The Starlost TV series in 1973. In it, three farmers in Cypress Corners discover that farm life is not so simple. Discovering a hidden door in the earth, they break through it, discovering they are not on Earth, but in a giant Noah's Ark-like spaceship. The spaceship is made up of giant "domes" holding the various cultures of humanity. Eventually, they find the bridge, it's crew dead and it's computer complaining that the ship is off course, heading into the path of a distant sun. The three farmers take it upon themselves to travel the ship, contacting the various cultures of humanity in search of somebody who can correct the course of the ship and save mankind. The second half of this movie is comprised of episode three, "The Goddess Calabra". In it, our three heroes find a society in which Rachel is treated like a goddess. Everything seems very complimentary, but not for long.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?593014</url></doc>
