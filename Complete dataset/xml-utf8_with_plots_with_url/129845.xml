<plot>This film explores the life of Mark Rowswell, a Canadian student who went to China to study the languages there. A chance encounter landed him an opportunity to appear on a popular TV show where he dazzled the audience with his command of the language. As a result, he has become a popular comedy star in that country and we explore his life in China as he develops a succesful career in the distinctive verbal comedy style of the region. In doing so, he has learned more about China and its people in a way he never thought possible for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?129845</url></doc>
