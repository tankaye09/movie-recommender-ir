<plot>Salvation (Without You) is a story of how three characters lives become entangled due to the death of a young woman. Michael is the young man responsible for the girl's death, though it was an accident, and seeks atonement. Hunter, the girl's father has tortured Michael relentlessly, and is driven by his own vengeance. Bridging the polar attitudes of these two men is Mona, a killer for hire with a strange resemblance to Hunter's daughter, and her own emotional baggage. When Mona and Michael meet, they form an unspoken bond that threatens not only her assignment, but their grip of reality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475106</url></doc>
