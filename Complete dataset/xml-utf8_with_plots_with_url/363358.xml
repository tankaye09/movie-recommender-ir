<plot>Media Matters looks at the standards, practices, and performance of the print and electronic news media. The New York Times said that "its straight-on, knowledgeable approach to the contentious issue of how news is being delivered . . . is a welcome addition to the PBS lineup." Media Matters is a magazine-formatted series, in the style of 60 Minutes. Each program consists of three ten-to-fifteen minute documentary pieces and "Tough Calls" a segment that contrasts how journalists and non-journalists would deal with difficult editorial choices.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363358</url></doc>
