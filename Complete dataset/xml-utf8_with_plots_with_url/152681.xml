<plot>After traveling throughout the world looking for his long lost father, Dirk blows into the quirky town of Westabooga, Alabama. Tough, road-hardened, AmerAsian, he can't help but draw attention in the Deep South of 1979. This is particularly true in Westabooga, where he soon discovers that everyone, including the crusty old Sheriff, is caught in a far-eastern warping of time and place. All the townspeople live happily in a weird world combining small town southern culture with their perceptions of traditional Far East customs. A love triangle develops between Dirk, Rose - the favorite "girl next door" - and Dewey Jr, Sensai of the local dojo and the son of the Sheriff. Dirk is framed for a crime and thrown out of town. With Dirk disgraced and the Sheriff away attending the national Narcoleptic convention in Birmingham, Westabooga is left in Dewey, Jr.'s evil clutches. The one hope for rescue-for both Rose and the town of Westabooga-lies in Dirk's fists and feet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152681</url></doc>
