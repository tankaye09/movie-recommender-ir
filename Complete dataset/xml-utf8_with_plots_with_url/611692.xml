<plot>In his first public television special in the post-Enron, post-9/11, and post-boom era-and twenty years post-In Search of Excellence-Tom Peters is back with a call to arms and a passionate wake-up call for the business world, educators, and society as a whole. In Re-imagine! Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age, America's most influential business thinker profiles five distinct and very different companies that exemplify Peters' new business ground rules where screwing up, destroying, and "thinking weird" rule the day. Each of the companies profiled faced revolutionary business challenges and responded by inventing entirely new opportunities. Each had to re-imagine the nature of work itself-and did so by soliciting the energy and engagement of each and every one of their people. The five companies profiled are: Memorial Hospital and Health System of South Bend, Indiana, for re-imagining health care education; the Turner Network Television (TNT), for its breakthrough concepts in re-imagining corporate branding; OXO, for re-imagining customer demographics and design; Ellie Mae, for re-imagining the way high-tech can work; and The Container Store Â®, for re-imagining the way employee talent can impact both the product and the bottom line. Based on his radical new book by DK Publishing (October 2003), the 60-minute special is produced in the successful format and style of In Search of Excellence, Peters' 1984 public television hit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611692</url></doc>
