<plot>A fine picture, taken from a moving boat passing up this great canal for a distance of about one mile, from the City of Mexico to the suburban village of Santa Anita. Hundreds of flat bottomed boats, used by the Mexicans to transport the produce from their farms to the market, pass the boat on which our camera is stationed. A beautiful and comprehensive view of one of the greatest produce canals in the world. The Mexican peasants, men, women and children, are seen pushing their flat bottomed boats along with long poles. The boats are loaded down with garden produce. The picture is interesting from start to finish. Many beautiful arched bridges are passed under during the trip, enhancing the scene greatly. Sold complete or in separate lengths.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319485</url></doc>
