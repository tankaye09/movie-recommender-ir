<plot>In order to protect the citizens of Mathura from the wrath of an evil king, Lord Krishna and his brother, Balram, decide to flee from the city. Once outside the city limits, the two brothers are confronted by the king's magical army, which they vanquish. Thereafter, Lord Krishna is crowned the King of Dwarka, and his mother, Yashoda, advises that he should get married, and strongly recommends that he marry Devi Rukmani. Whilst Devi Rukmani, who is devoted to Lord Krishna, has to face her brother, who wants her to marry King Shishupal. In the midst of this dispute, Lord Nard Muni intervenes and advises her brother to hold a Swayamvar so that Rukmani can chose the best husband. Her brother agrees. Watch what happens when the Swayamvar takes place, where Shishupal is ready to wed Rukmani - by hook or by crook.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272778</url></doc>
