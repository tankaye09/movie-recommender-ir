<plot>LITTLE MISS DEWIE: A Duckumentary is a funny, heartwarming, and true inter-species love story that also examines important animal welfare issues. In July 2007, award-winning animal welfare journalist, and Buddhist nun, Mira Tweti, found an orphaned duckling at a local lagoon in Los Angeles, CA, and took her home. A parrot expert, Tweti (prounounced: Tweety, and it is her given name), planned to give the little duck she called Dewie, to a rescue. Through a series of unexpected situations, Dewie lived in Tweti's apartment for more than two months while the latter searched for a perfect duck home. Along the way the Playboy Mansion and the Bel Air Country club agreed to take her. But in the end, Dewie went to live with Lani and Edward Culver and their duck, Flipper. Dewie and Flipper are now a couple and the Culvers and Tweti consider themselves related by marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338262</url></doc>
