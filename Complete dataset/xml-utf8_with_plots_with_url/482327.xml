<plot>A series of gags hung on a football game. The running gag is a baby licking an ice-cream cone; the portly man sitting next to him keeps stealing licks. We see the warmups (a kicker punts sitting in a chair; three other kickers break into a chorus line). The coin flip: the players pile on. The kickoff: the ball stays put and the man holding it is kicked. A re-kick: one player is used like a golf club by another. Some razzle-dazzle on the scrimmage line. The QB fades (literally) for a pass. Half-time: a quick show by the marching band; the team beats up their coach; a cheerleader rallies his team's supporters: one man. Second half: A touchdown run is interrupted for a commercial announcement; when completed, a cheerleader literally yells his head off. A quick montage of action, then the final gun which comes from the ice-cream tot, finally fed up with his neighbor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482327</url></doc>
