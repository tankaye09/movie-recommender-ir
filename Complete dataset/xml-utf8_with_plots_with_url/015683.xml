<plot>Two teenage girls sit in detention at their high school, awaiting their father's exit from the principal's office. The sisters (Julie and Kara) who have a strained relationship take the time to reflect on the events that got them there and what part their father plays in their lives. The past plays a big part, as one of the daughters carries much resentment and anger about the path that her life is going, so much so that she blames her father. As the girls await their father, they anticipate the anger that the father will unleash on them. What they expect is not exactly what they get as the father takes the opposite path of what they expect from him, with emotional results. As the father makes his grand entrance, visible annoyed at his daughters, he makes an immediate adjustment which surprises them as his love for his daughters outweighs the current trouble they're in.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015683</url></doc>
