<plot>It's almost 4 a.m., and three people are in an all-night diner. Jim (the cook) talks with a customer while a third man drinks coffee a few stools away. The talkative guy feels constricted by his girlfriend, who doesn't understand why he'd get up, get dressed, and head for the diner in the middle of the night. As he talks, a woman walks in, and they exchange glances. Will it come to more than that, will he say hi, will she smile in response, will she initiate a conversation? With Jim and the other customer urging the talkative guy to speak to the woman, he screws his courage to the sticking place as the clock ticks.</plot><plot>It's almost 4 a.m., and three people are in an all-night diner.
