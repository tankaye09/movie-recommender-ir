<plot>In April 1994, the ferry Estonia capsized during a storm in the Baltic Sea, and went down with 850 people. In 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on the Alaskan coast, gushing 40 million tons of oil into the sea. It is these types of catastrophies that we in the western world will do anything to avoid. We come with greater demands for better safety on board these large ships, many of which cannot live up to these ever increasing demands and therefore must be scrapped. Because we don't want to pay the price for having these ships scrapped in a proper manner, we send the ships to countries like India where the impact on the environment and safety are not taken into account.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499832</url></doc>
