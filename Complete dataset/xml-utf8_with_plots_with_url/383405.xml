<plot>Reed Kirkham, ace schlock film producer, is a man moments away from re-establishing his artistic ideals. When Reed decides to return to his creative roots, his overactive talking liver, (the "gut feeling" that has led him to success for the past two decades) pays an unexpected visit. The angry liver exits his body, determined to force Reed into production on yet another grade-Z film, and it won't take "no" for an answer. Now Reed must make the ultimate decision-either buckle to the forces of his own body; or risk it all to return to the artist he longs to be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383405</url></doc>
