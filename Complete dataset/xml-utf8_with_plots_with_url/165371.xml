<plot>In a virtuoso succession of fragments of images and sound, eddie d. does not show the world of ordinary objects as being inert or passive but as if they are constantly in motion. Hence the sounds that they make when they move, are no longer insignificant noises but have been transformed into rhythmic beats. We hear cutlery clattering in a sink, sandwiches springing from the toaster, a creaking door, spray paint being sprayed... In addition we see and hear actions and sounds that would normally be viewed as being unimportant or banal such as a mouth belching, a throat being cleared, fingers rubbing glass, fingernails scraping across a wall and the stamping of a foot. eddie d. presents illustrative music by editing audio and video tonally. Just like a conventional musical composition, this clip consists of various parts that are defined by the way in which these fragments of image and sound are related to each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165371</url></doc>
