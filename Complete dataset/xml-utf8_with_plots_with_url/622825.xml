<plot>The piece is about two completely different people, with different life styles and attitudes. At least this is how it seems at first. The girl is a stereotypical party girl, abusing drugs and alcohol. The guy is a focused businessman who prefers to be lonely if it contributes to his success. Due to an incident they are, however, encouraged to lead a conversation, which turns out to be more beneficial to them then they might have expected. In this elaboration of opinions of life, this short explores the different ways of how to find your place in nowadays society and how to ignore prejudice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622825</url></doc>
