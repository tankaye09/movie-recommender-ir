<plot>Robert Sloan runs a small rural airport with his two teenage sons. Immobilized by the brutal murder of his wife fifteen years earlier, Robert runs the family business as a refuge from a world he believes is rigged against him. His younger son, Conrad, searches for a way out of his father's world by rebuilding a derelict airplane. Robert's efforts to stop his sons from leaving lead to the boys' theft of the plane and their daring flight across the country. Although the boys' bravado carries them to the base of the Rocky Mountains, the high challenge of crossing sets the two brothers against each other in a battle, and test, of wills. That battle, and its outcome, forces Robert to confront his own malevolence and rescue his relationship with his sons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195917</url></doc>
