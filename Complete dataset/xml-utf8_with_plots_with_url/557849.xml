<plot>A grand scene, beyond description, showing flames, smoke, people in the windows praying to be rescued from the great four-story building. It shows the pompier ladders being operated in the endeavor to save the lives of the people in the upper story of this great tenement building. In this picture is seen the awful leap for life, showing a woman jumping from the third-story window into the life net held by the firemen; the great volumes of smoke and sheets of flame which envelope the building; the fire tug pull in and get in action. Space will not permit us to further describe this greatest of all great real pictures. Then comes the returning home scene, after the terrible ordeal the firemen have gone through. They, like the rest of us, are glad to welcome that old familiar air, "There's No Place Like Home." You see them pull into their quarters, draw the fires from under the engine and back their apparatus into the fire house. This closes one of the greatest set of pictures ever shown, and one that has created more excitement, applause and enthusiasm than an act or set of pictures ever shown on the American stage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557849</url></doc>
