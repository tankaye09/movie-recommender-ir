<plot>In order to escape her ruthless and exploitative mother, a sexy 17-year-old model goes into hiding with an older man on his sailboat and is mercilessly hunted down by the Miami underworld. Dangerous Passenger is a suspenseful romantic thriller set in the exotic Bahamas that keeps us in continuous suspense. It has the terror elements of the sailing film DEAD CALM, as well as the sexual intrigue of SWEPT AWAY. DANGEROUS PASSENGER is a male fantasy story that satisfies all story requirements including depth of character with lots of steamy scenes. We are drawn in and entertained not only by the events, but also the exotic locations and the foreignness of the sailing lifestyle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126096</url></doc>
