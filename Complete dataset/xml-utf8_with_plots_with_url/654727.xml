<plot>White Rabbit is an intense examination of a Vietnamese- American family torn apart by sexual abuse. American films typically portray Asians as martial arts heroes, nerdy computer types, or obedient immigrants. Very often they are either super human or subhuman. The idea was to create a film that depicts an Asian American family dealing with real problems that were not grounded in stereotypes.  Child sexual abuse is one of the last cultural taboos especially in the Asian community where it is seen as 'an American problem'.  There can be an opportunity not only for Asian American families but all families to recognize and confront these disturbing and devastating issues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654727</url></doc>
