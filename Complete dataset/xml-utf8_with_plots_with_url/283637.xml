<plot>There are many stories about the birth of Kabir. One of the non-controversial versions was taken as plot of the film. Neeru and Neema, a Muslim couple, traveling on a cart observes a child floating on a lotus leaf at Laharitara Lake near Kasi (Varanasi). They pick the boy up and named him Kabir. He grows around Muslim and Hindu areas, learning the differences. His Guru Sheik Taqhi teaches him about Muslim way of life and another Guru Ramananda Teaches about Hindu scriptures. As Kabir grows young, he tries to show the people about good and bad in each religion and asks them to correct their deeds. Instead of accepting his teachings they try to beat him and send him out of the village. Even then he won't stop his style. Then both Hindus and Muslims complain about him to Nawab Sikander Lodi. The king tries to punish him in many ways but in vain. At last all recognizes his Divinity..</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283637</url></doc>
