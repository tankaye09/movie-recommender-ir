<plot>Forgot Me Vest follows 22 year old South London pugilist, Scott McDonald, as he fights his way through the ABA's - England's only national boxing contest. With no job skills or qualifications, Scott has nothing to loose and everything to gain, including the prospect of Lottery funding and England national selection, should he win the ABA championships. In Scott's corner are the legendary trainers from the 100 year-old Fitzroy Lodge, who admonish and deliver inspiring pre-fight prep talks in equal measure. Meanwhile, Scott shares his dreams and fears as he struggles to cut weight and live up to the history and expectations of the club.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200787</url></doc>
