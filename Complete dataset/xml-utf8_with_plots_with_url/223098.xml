<plot>This tragicomic observation was shot in elderly housing somewhere in Amsterdam. We see the senior citizens making coffee, playing bingo, watching TV and falling asleep during all these activities. It is often both hilarious and sad, like when the residents try to find their way around the anonymous building. When your memory and body are failing you and every floor looks identical, this is no simple task. Meanwhile, the coroner is unloading his stretcher outside.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?223098</url></doc>
