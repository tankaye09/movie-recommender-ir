<plot>Circa British Raj in India, in a small village, Bansiram has owned and maintained a plot of land donated to him by a kind-hearted Zamindar. The Zamindar passes away, and his lecherous, womanizing, and alcoholic son views this plot, and describes it as heavenly, and wants it at any cost. Bansiram refuses to sell, and the Zamindar's son wants it by hook or by crook. Bansiram appeals to the British for protection, which they provide, and Bansiram is thus able to save his property. Shortly thereafter the Zamindar's son passes away, and his look-alike son, Devraj comes to take-over the estate. Devraj does not consider taking-over Bansiram's land as a priority, and years go by. The Zamindar's soul, unable to complete it's task during this life-time, wonders around in anguish and pain - waiting. When Devraj finally goes to see Bansiram, he finds an elderly semi-senile man, who has a grandson, Chotu, who wants to build a business on the land to sell alcohol, and Devraj decides to take advantage of this situation with unpredictable results.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269127</url></doc>
