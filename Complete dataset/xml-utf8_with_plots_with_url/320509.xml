<plot>After the Holocaust, men and women who either had nowhere else to go or were emotionally shattered by their experience ended up in a mental hospital in Israel where some of them spent up to 36 years. Many were abandoned by their families. This heartbreaking documentary follows estranged daughters as they visit mothers they had been separated from for decades.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320509</url></doc>
