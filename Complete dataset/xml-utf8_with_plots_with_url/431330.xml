<plot>Celebrating the historic and still unexplained Arizona mass sighting of 1997 this critically acclaimed and internationally award winning Documentary is based on the bestselling book, "The Phoenix Lights...A Skeptic's Discovery That We Are Not Alone". Over 30 credible eyewitnesses, children, scientists, military, pilots and experts give compelling testimony to the reality of these mysterious global visitations, including former AZ Gov. Fife Symington who discloses that he witnessed the event and it wasn't military! Astronaut and moon walker Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Sc.D. confirms that these phenomena are real! A Commercial &amp; Vietnam pilot witnessed the silent, mile wide craft glide above his head. A Veteran 911 Phoenix Police operator tells all about that fateful night. NASA footage confirms that these phenomena are here. UFO buffs call it the most documented and important mass sighting ever recorded. But still today, the military and government can only offer questionable explanations as to what the anomalous lights truly were. In over 11 years, the strange phenomena have never been duplicated or re-enacted [although the military tried fruitlessly, three years later]. Many experts and witnesses insist that what appeared in the Arizona skies was something beyond this world. But there is much more to the story! What were they? How did they affect the witnesses? What do they mean?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431330</url></doc>
