<plot>Remake of the 1945 cult film directed by Val Lewton and starring Boris Karloff. In the original Karloff played a Greek military commander on an island where a plague breaks out. He orders the isle quarantined and as residents fall ill and die, some begin to suspect that a vampire-demon might be the cause of the deaths. Remake will be set against the backdrop of a viral outbreak in Afghanistan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269398</url></doc>
