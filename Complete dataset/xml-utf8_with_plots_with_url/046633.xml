<plot>This is another bogus title from the error-filled pages of Richard E. Braff's Silent Short Film Working Papers. No film bearing this title was either produced or distributed at this time; most likely, it's a working title for some other film which was eventually released under another title, identity unknown, or else it was announced, but never filmed or completed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046633</url></doc>
