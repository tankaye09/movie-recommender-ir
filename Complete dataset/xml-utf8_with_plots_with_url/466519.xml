<plot>The Pink Panther longs for a pet, but he hasn't got enough money to buy one. A suspect man in a street corner fools him into buying a rock as his pet. The panther adopts the rock anyway, and it immediately takes on a life of its own. When the panther is out walking the rock, they pass a place where rocks and gravel are sold. The rock goes wild and eats the entire supply, growing into a huge boulder. The panther is kicked out of his home by his own mother after the boulder has made a large hole in the floor. The persistent boulder rolls into some wet cement, making it so huge the panther gets terrified and runs away from it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?466519</url></doc>
