<plot>John Hawkins is an assistant district attorney from New York. Things are going so well for him, he is being considered as the next candidate for district attorney. But things change when a friend of his from Seattle, the district attorney calls to tell him that his 16 year old son, Dylan is in trouble, and he is tired of letting his wealthy grandparents bail him out. He tells John that he plans to come down hard on his son unless he takes responsibility for him. It seems that John has had little contact with Dylan for seven years. John's an alcoholic who felt that Dylan would be better off with his grandparents, while he tries to fix his own problems first. John agrees to take Dylan and decides to take Dylan a ride on his old motorcycle and go around so that they can reestablish a relationship. Along the way they run into all sorts of people whose lives they get involved with before moving on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119560</url></doc>
