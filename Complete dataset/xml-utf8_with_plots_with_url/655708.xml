<plot>Derrick is a Modeling Agent who loves his work, and his girl. It's no problem working around these women and his "hands off" rule appears to be working just fine. Well, for the moment anyways. Nina has no real problem with her man's profession, after all, he is her man. Then there's Rita, a very seductive woman who finds her way back into Derrick's life. Why is she hanging around their home, and who is she really there to see? This movie comes with a twist, revealing one's passion and desire to their lover and to themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655708</url></doc>
