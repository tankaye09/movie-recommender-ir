<plot>It has been two years since Jason's last encounter with a plutonium boss, a group of radioactive mutants and some of the craziest beasts and mechanical beings ever to grace the planet and these days, everything is at ease. It was a dark and stormy night. Lightning strikes the barn where Jason has hidden his battle car, SOPHIA III. In the morning, Jason finds the car has been stripped and some major pieces were missing. They were stolen by a whole new batch of maniacal mutant beasts, so Jason constructs a new battle car, SOPHIA IV, and once again heads underground to battle the beasts of berdon in 8 more harrowing and perplexing stages in order to recover his stolen parts and once and for all rid the world of these troublesome mutants.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074303</url></doc>
