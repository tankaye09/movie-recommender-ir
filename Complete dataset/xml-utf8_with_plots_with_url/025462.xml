<plot>Berlin. Night. An old, homeless drunk stumbles down the street. Ignored by everyone - almost everyone. Suddenly a woman appears in front of him - mid thirties, thin, a drug addict. They stand face-to-face for the first time in years - father and daughter, Volker and Anna. Anna is desperate, demands the key to grandpa's safety deposit box, a key which she knows her father still has. But Volker claims to have hidden it in another part of the city. As they walk to get it, it becomes clear that Anna is bleeding from her stomach - but not all the blood is hers. And then Volker discovers the bloodied knife she's carrying... As time runs out and the police close in, father and daughter walk through the night. Under cover of darkness the secrets of their East German past explode in a final confrontation - and the consequences of times past come to light.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025462</url></doc>
