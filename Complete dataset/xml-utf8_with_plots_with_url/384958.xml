<plot>After serving sixteen years in prison, Romell is released on parole and reports to his parole officer. There he is offered an opportunity for employment at the House of David, an assisted living facility for the aging. Romell is promptly befriended by Aliza who, through her persistent urging for him to reflect on his life, motivates Romell to change his outlook on life and to recognize the value of time. Ultimately, Aliza's guidance and stories of her own tragic experiences inspire Romell to change his life for the better.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384958</url></doc>
