<plot>A guy sitting by himself at an outdoor caf√© on the Upper West Side lights a cigarette and reads "Franny and Zooey." He notices a woman sitting alone at the next table; they make glancing eye contact. She takes a cigarette out of her purse. As he's about to offer her a light, a man arrives at her table, apologizing for being late. He tells her a story involving the subway, a boy and his mother, and a turnstile. Her cigarette remains unlit. Does she have something to tell her companion? Has our Salinger reader missed an opportunity or does he now know something about this woman that her boyfriend doesn't?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?621391</url></doc>
