<plot>Three bums are seen leaning up against a saloon bar. They drink and two of them go out, leaving the third still leaning against the bar. The barkeeper demands his pay, but there is nothing done. In a rage he seizes a bung starter and knocks the man to the floor. Then, coming from behind the bar, he proceeds to give the man a terrific beating. Among other things, the bartender lifts the man up bodily and hurls him to the floor. But in spite of all the beating the man (a dummy) receives, he calmly arises and proceeds to knock out the bartender, and leaves the place with the grandest nonchalance. A thoroughly funny picture from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655183</url></doc>
