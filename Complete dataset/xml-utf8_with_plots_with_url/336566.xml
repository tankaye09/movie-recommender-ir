<plot>VINCE D'ANGELO is a low life, Congressman from New Jersey who'll stop at nothing to get elected to the U.S. Senate. With his sleazy, below-the-belt campaign tactics, he's hell-bent on destroying his opponents reputations and getting himself and his wife to the top of the heap in Washington D.C. In "SCHOOL, GIRLS, &amp; YOU," it's the 1950's -- and strait-laced Everdale University is about to go "coed". In order to prepare it's student body for the onslaught of "females" on campus, they present this hard-hitting educational film. Wally Bile is the "wrong-way" role model with Science Professor, Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom explains the vital "do's and don'ts" on dating women, and the all-important "warning signs" and "danger signals" to look out for when close-encountering the opposite sex.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?336566</url></doc>
