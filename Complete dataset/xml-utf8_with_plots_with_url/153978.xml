<plot>In, Dog Run, we meet Ricky and Carol, two lovers who live in the heart of the East Village, right across from Tompkins Square Park, and the "dog run". There are two females in Ricky's life - his beautiful French girlfriend, Carol, and his dog, Luna, who has been a constant companion in his life for several years. Ricky loves Carol, and he loves making love to her even more, to the point where he forgets to walk his beloved dog, Luna, who observes everything around her. Carol is not interested in Luna and even ignores the fact that Luna has defecated in the apartment - again. "It's not my dog ... it's not even my house," she whines to Ricky. Throughout it all, Luna watches everything, including how exasperated Ricky is at having to clean up after her. One day, as he's running late for work again, Ricky asks Carol if she'll walk Luna. She reluctantly agrees and takes her to the park which is where more troubles begin. When tragedy hits, will Carol love Ricky as much as Luna does? And will Ricky realize who his loyal friends really are?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153978</url></doc>
