<plot>Delbert and Loretta's marriage started out exciting (they have sex), but it's failing. Each suspects the other of cheating. Loretta describes her fantasy to the counselor, watching Kim and Bud have sex. Delbert tells the counselor about an imagined affair where Loretta has sex with Bud, Rick, and Huntley simultaneously. Loretta tells the counselor she suspects a rendezvous between Delbert and two dancers from Delbert and Huntley's club. Loretta tries to spice things up by having sex with Kim and letting Delbert watch. Delbert is frustrated, and gets more frustrated when Huntley has sex with one of their dancers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200589</url></doc>
