<plot>This picture shows an old gentleman seated at his shaving table. The razor is evidently giving him a great deal of trouble, as he catches hold of the brush and with a great show of impatience he hurriedly coats his face with the foaming soap and makes a second attempt at removing his beard. He scrapes and scrapes, and judging from the painful facial expressions, the razor grows duller with every stroke. The old man makes a new and ludicrous twitch of the mouth every time he draws the razor across the face. This is a 50 foot film of an ordinary scene of every day life, and its mirth provoking merits have never been surpassed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009954</url></doc>
