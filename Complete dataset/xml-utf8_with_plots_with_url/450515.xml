<plot>A talented but reckless young longshoreman Sun Chi-Chiang (Ling Yun) from the wrong side of the docks gets a chance to achieve showbiz stardom as the Krupka-esque 'Thunder King Drummer' with a tip from his mild mannered but equally talented composer brother Yi-chuan (Yang Fan), both to the dismay of his bitter working class mother who disapproves of her sons leading their lives as struggling musicians. Chi-Chiang gets his 15 minutes of fame with the patronage of the beautiful well-heeled promoter Li-Chen (Lily Ho) seeking a replacement for the drummer &amp; lover (Chen Hung Lieh) who was tempted away by a rival promoter. Chih-chuan wins a televised jazz drumming contest against his rival and achieves new-found fame but not without further obstacles including his mother's (Kao Pao Shu) disapproval, his rival's jealously, his rival's vamp (Angela Yu Chien) girlfriend's advances and a chorus of shady denizens who inhabit the nightclub scene plotting for King Drummer's demise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?450515</url></doc>
