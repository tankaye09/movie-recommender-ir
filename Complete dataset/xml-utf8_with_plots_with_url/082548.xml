<plot>Breathing Port Robinson is an informative and entertaining look inside the real story behind the feature film in development Port Robinson Road. The feature documentary takes an intimate look into the real life paranormal encounters experienced by Dave McRae and his fellow College friends, during their many visits to an abandoned farmhouse on Port Robinson Road in November 2000. Independent filmmakers and long time friends Dave McRae and Bruce Dale struggle to bring Dave's vision to the big screen. With very little money in their pockets, a finished screenplay sitting on a desk, and a unique take on a genre unlike any other, Bruce and Dave set out to create awareness for the story with this documentary. Their passion, dedication and heart for the craft of filmmaking is truly shown through the simplicity that is Breathing Port Robinson. The documentary includes exclusive interviews with former group members who experienced the house, as well as never before seen video and photographs. Breathing Port Robinson allows even the most experienced filmmaker to step away objectively and to realize once again that great films only come from great stories, and great stories truly come from within.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082548</url></doc>
