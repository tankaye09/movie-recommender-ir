<plot>A collection of animals goes to school; their teacher, a goose, asks them several questions, during which time an ape, sitting behind an elephant, keeps tormenting the elephant. The teacher leaves the room, putting a turtle in charge. While she's gone, things go fine for a while, but the ape starts an all-out book tossing brawl. As the teacher returns, everyone suddenly stops, and although the room is a shambles, she congratulates them on behaving and dismisses them for the day. On the way home, the elephant (who kept reminding us that he never forgets) finally takes revenge on the ape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036870</url></doc>
