<plot>Jacob Lester spends his days lost in the world of comic books and his nights as a door to door delivery man for Hollywood's largest drug dealer. With his mother stricken with a painful illness, his father missing in action and his sister flirting with disaster, Jacob is convinced he can be like on of his favorite superheroes and save them all. Unfortunately, good intentions don't always bring good results. Drifting through the nighttime world of Los Angeles, Jacob discovers he's not the only one doing all the wrong things for all the right reasons.
