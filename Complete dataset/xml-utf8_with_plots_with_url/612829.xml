<plot>Dad's not having a great morning: at breakfast, his wife points out that his attempt to fix the sink was unsuccessful, his older daughter is miffed that he tossed one of her drawings from school, and his younger daughter awakes to find that the Tooth Fairy didn't show up last night, as promised. Dad makes excuses for the Tooth Fairy. Late that night, after fixing the sink, he remembers his dental duties. Under his sleeping daughter's pillow, he finds a note and the first clue to a treasure hunt she has set out for the Tooth Fairy. He's exhausted, but he searches out clue after clue as the night passes. It's a race against the sun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612829</url></doc>
