<plot>A young couple's lives and loyalties are divided by the Berlin Wall. When the Soviets begin to build the wall in Berlin in August 1961, Peter Treppman wants to flee to the west, his wife Sabine wants to stay. He persuades her to come along and while she makes it across the closing border, he does not. As Peter's life in the communist East deteriorates, Sabine struggles to adjust to her life alone in the West. The only chance she sees to get her husband across the iron curtain is to enlist the help of an American GI, as they are still allowed to cross the border without being searched. The dilemma unfolds when Sabine begins to fall in love with the young soldier.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152419</url></doc>
