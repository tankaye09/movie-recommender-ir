<plot>Irv Kaplan has been with the Israeli educational tv since its foundation 30 years ago as "trust for educational tv". Over the years he has written, starred in, directed, and produced a few of the stations landmark shows. In this film, his retirement project, he reviews the stations work and the changes it has undergone. Having been into comedy throughout his professional life, this "documentary" has more then a touch of humour in it as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?586617</url></doc>
