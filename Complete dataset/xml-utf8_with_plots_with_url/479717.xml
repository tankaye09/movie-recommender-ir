<plot>A nervous young man sits in a waiting room; he's about to take an aptitude test. He's unsure of what he should do with his life, and his answers to this initial test get him sent to a haunted-looking house for further tests, including electroshock. Visions in his head take him into a wild adventure that proves to be a video game he's playing while he's an insurance adjuster who wants to sing cowboy songs. After singing about the range, he decides to be a geezer out with the cows: he finally understands where he fits in. However, even that simple life proves to be more difficult than he realizes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479717</url></doc>
