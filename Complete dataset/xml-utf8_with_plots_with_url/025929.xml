<plot>In March of 2003, a young Basque poet and four friends-three musicians and an artist-came to New York City almost by chance, to do a half dozen bilingual poetry evenings, with music. "The six or seven hundred thousand Basque speakers in the world today "can fit into a New York neighborhood," the poet, Kirmen Uribe, says in AGIAN / MAYBE. "So what does a community that fits into a neighborhood have to offer the world? Or in that city that's the center of the world, what can it offer?" What the five discovered there surprised them. AGIAN / MAYBE shows how something that seemed to begin in New York in 2003 in fact had its origins long before. AGIAN / MAYBE is a ping-pong contemplation, with music, of the five histories behind the whole, and makes a guess of its own at possible outcomes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025929</url></doc>
