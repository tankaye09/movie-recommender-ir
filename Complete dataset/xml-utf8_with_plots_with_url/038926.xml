<plot>James FitzPatrick narrates a journey to Bundy, a small city in India that has changed little since 1342. Traditions rule, including fealty to the Raj, whom we meet on his 31st birthday. Women appear in public wearing veils. There's little poverty and no begging. Wild monkeys play at a shrine. We then journey to the pink city of Jaipur, founded by a mathematician who wanted to build a beautiful city. We visit a massive palace for its Raj and see sacred cows. En route, we pass farms where the equipment is feudal. After Jaipur, we visit the abandoned city of Amber: built then abandoned by a extravagant ruler who wanted a new city and palace. Riding elephants, they return to Jaipur.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038926</url></doc>
