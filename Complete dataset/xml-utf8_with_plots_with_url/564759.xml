<plot>A daytime court show with Judge Mark Fiedel behind the bench. For the better part of two decades, Mark has practiced law in New York, New Jersey and Florida and it's no surprise that he has seen and heard it all! With his quick wit and keen sensibilities, Judge Fiedel will preside over this daily, half-hour, court room drama with sincerity, humor and a little sarcasm but make no mistake; his rulings will be firm and FINAL! From civil, criminal and family disputes, to confrontations between lovers, roommates and friends, Judge Fiedel will provide his litigants a forum to air their disputes in which he will make a fair yet firm verdict. Unlike many of the other day time court room shows you will witness cases involving some of your favorite REALITY TV PERSONALTIES and D-LIST CELEBRITIES, not to mention a mix of surfers, drag queens, porn stars and beauty queens gone bad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564759</url></doc>
