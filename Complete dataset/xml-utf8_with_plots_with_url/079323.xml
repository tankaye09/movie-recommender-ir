<plot>This documentary video focuses on several performing artists and writers working and living in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur during the boom period of the late 1990s. The portrait of the artists is at the same time a portrait of a city in frenzy. Jo, Mano, Rehman, Rafique and friends are critical of the status quo and reflect upon the current political and economic situation through their work. How do they deal with the mainstream and how does the society react towards them?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079323</url></doc>
