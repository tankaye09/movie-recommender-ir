<plot>Oguz writes holding the pen between his teeth. He walks on his knees. When he has to pee, he must call his mom. Taking a shover is almost a venture. His mother has dedicated her life to his son. Together they've fought against Oguz's egocentric and despot father whom his mother married against her will. This is a story of a handicapped man and his mother. This is a story of two united brave souls.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025505</url></doc>
