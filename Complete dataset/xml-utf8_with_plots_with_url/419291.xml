<plot>OZZY &amp; DRIX, based on the breakout characters from the feature film "Osmosis Jones," is an animated inner-body, buddy-cop comedy which follows the adventures of white blood cell cop Ozzy and his partner, over-the-counter cold pill Drix, as they defend the City of Hector # the body of a 13-year-old boy. The second season of Ozzy &amp; Drix amplifies their infectious humor with Ozzy's in-your-face antics and Drix's knowledgeable yet clueless wit as they continue to take on whatever comes their way # regardless of how small or simple a situation may appear in the outside world of Hector. Only they know what really happens "skin deep" and what it takes to always be on 24-hour alert # whether it be the sprouting of Hector's first whisker, a rowdy encounter with the Testosterone gang, an unexpected appendicitis attack or the long-awaited visit from Drix's Auntie Histamine. With their headquarters behind Hector's cornea, these partners have established their "private eye" agency...hoping to keep Hector safe from the many changes and dangers associated with adolescence. This bod-squad will get a reality-check as Officer Maria Amino carries on as their ally and loveably obnoxious Mayor Spryman continues to live vicariously through Hector by clutching onto his adolescent attempt to make Hector popular. Ozzy also will introduce everyone to his new navigational system # Backseat, a neurotic yet extremely funny know-it-all # and the worst backseat driver ever! Ozzy &amp; Drix's second season will bring more eye-popping excitement in the City of Hector as they cruise around in a cilia-powered "Cel Camino." This one-of-a-kind pair of problem-solvers are ready to fight for what's right -- on a cellular level.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?419291</url></doc>
