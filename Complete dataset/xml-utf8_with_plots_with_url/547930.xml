<plot>In claymation, the Ontario Censor Board meets to consider an animated short, which begins simply enough, but soon scandalizes the Board with the sexual activities of its two characters: a man and woman meet on a street corner, go to a bedroom, and soon are swinging on a chandelier. A dog joins them somehow, although by now, we see only the Board and its shocked response. The film finished, they must determine their rating: out come darts and a dart board. What rating will the film receive? Will the morals of the people of Ontario be protected?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547930</url></doc>
