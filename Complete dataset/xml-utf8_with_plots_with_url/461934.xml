<plot>In the near future, marshal law imposes a puritanical New Order. Ariel and Zain have been married less than a year, and they're under the gun to produce "a little soldier" for the regime. Zain's gung ho, wearing his military beret during mechanical sex that's limited to her fertile periods. When a quiet, older neighbor is arrested, Ariel explores his flat, finding a room behind a false wall; in it is a contraband VCR and tapes of loving couples who seek and give pleasure. Over the next few months, she visits the room three times, having a revelation each time. When she tries to bring these revelations to her relationship with Zain, it goes badly. In her final revelation, Zain is irrelevant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461934</url></doc>
