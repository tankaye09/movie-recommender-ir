<plot>Even after the end of her lustre empire, Ranimaa still believes that she is an empress, though her palace has now been turned into a hotel. She manages this hotel with the help of three daughters, Krishna, Ganga, and Kaveri, and a son, Kuldip. Krishna used to love Dinesh, but her plans to marry him were foiled by Kuldip. Ganga loves Prakash, a motor mechanic, who does not meet with Ranimaa's approval. Things liven up quite a bit, when Ranimaa is told by the police that four bank-robbers have moved into the hotel, and she will not permit them to search her hotel nor the people residing there.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276548</url></doc>
