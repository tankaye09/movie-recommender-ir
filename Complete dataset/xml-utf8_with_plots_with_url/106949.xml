<plot>The camera is stationed in the center of the Pan-American Esplanade near the west fountain band stand, and looking toward the Horticultural Building. The film was put in motion and the camera slowly revolved from west to east, taking in the Temple of Music, the Graphic Arts Building, the Court of Fountains with the Cascades and Statuary in the foreground. While the camera is passing the Cascades, the Grand Basic and Electric Tower are plainly visible in the background. The picture finishes with the camera looking directly east with the east Esplanade fountain in the foreground, and the U.S. Government Building in the background.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106949</url></doc>
