<plot>Omikron is a massive city-state, in which the people are ruled blindly by an ancient supercomputer and an iron-fist communist dictator (whom carries out the computer's orders). Little do the people of Omikron know, however, that a demon lord from the last circle of Hell is the true power behind governing their land. The Nomad Soul, a foretold hero, enters Omikron through his computer and becomes trapped in this parallel dimension. Desperate to escape back to his own world, and to help newfound friends fight the dark forces guiding Omikron, the Nomad Soul does what he must to liberate Omikron forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410333</url></doc>
