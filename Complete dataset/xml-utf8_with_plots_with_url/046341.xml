<plot>"Art &amp; Craft" is a half-hour documentary on art conservation at the Willilamstown Art Conservation Center, affiliated with the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. The documentary, shot over the course of two years, shows detailed restoration work on a drawing by Henri Matisse; a 2,000 year old Roman bust; a document said to be the earliest written reference to baseball in the United States; and a Herter Brothers chair, designed for the Vanderbilt mansion, valued at a million dollars, among other items. The conservation center was founded in 1976 as part of a network of non-profits around the country that serve smaller museums, colleges, historical societies and individuals.The film features close-up footage of conservators at work as well as interviews with conservators and the executive director, who explains the purpose, training and methods involved in this unsung work.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046341</url></doc>
