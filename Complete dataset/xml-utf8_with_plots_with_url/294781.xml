<plot>"Knocked Out? Aging Boxers Fight the Clock" follows two middle-aged boxers as they compete in a young man's sport. Dexter "The Dingo" Dunworth, 52, is the oldest active professional boxer in the world, according to Guinness World Records. Grant Walker, 42, is an amateur who runs his own company, cares for his two children, and squeezes in the occasional boxing match. In this film, we see if these two men will triumph, or be "Knocked Out."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294781</url></doc>
