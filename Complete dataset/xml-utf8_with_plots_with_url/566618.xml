<plot>Mr. Garvin is a writer who is seeking a quiet place to do his research and work on his book. Although he was staying in a small village, he find the children to be quite noisy and the local doctor, Mr. MacKinnon, suggests that he take a room with the Falshaw family, who have no children. Their farm is isolated and should provide him with the peace and quiet he needs. Soon after his arrival however, he hears a child crying and soon sees the ghost of a young girl. Garvin is a sympathetic man and he assumes that something happened in that house years ago. When the doctor recounts the story of the family, he works to heal the wounds that have existed there for so many years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?566618</url></doc>
