<plot>Long time friends and aspiring Toronto-based filmmakers, 'Kenny Hotz' (qv) and 'Spencer Rice' (qv) (who Kenny calls Spenny), have written a movie, a transgender mob comedy called "The Dawn", the script which they are trying to sell to get produced. They envision the movie to be a big budget Hollywood production with an all-star cast, rather than a low budget flick. Through cold calling, they quickly learn that they will need one piece of the movie in place - whether it be financing, or a major star or director signed on - before anyone else will really listen to them. More importantly, they need a reputable agent to do the leg work for them. They take the opportunity of the 1996 Toronto International Film Festival - a festival where many of the Hollywood elite attend - to pitch the movie to whomever will listen. Some people do give them advice, as well as advice concerning the making of this documentary, however they garner no solid leads. Thus, they move to the ultimate step in trying to get their movie made: go to Hollywood and knock on doors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434103</url></doc>
