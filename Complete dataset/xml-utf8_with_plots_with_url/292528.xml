<plot>A mysterious hand appears from the side of the picture, and, after motioning for a second, produces a number of silver coins and drops them in a glass. Eventually the glass is filled with money, and, reaching down, the hand empties the glass into another hand that appears in this section of the film. The money disappears as rapidly as it came, and the hands shake, closing the picture. Very mystifying.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292528</url></doc>
