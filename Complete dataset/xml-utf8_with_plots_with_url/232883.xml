<plot>There are over 100,000 people homeless in Britain. The aim of the series was to challenge perceptions of homelessness; change the attitudes that business people have and in the process observe the demanding transition into the working world for five homeless people with major companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Pret-a-Manger and Wates Construction.These moving stories of human frailty and redemption, gave for the first time, a dignified voice to people who are not often heard and seldom depicted as real human beings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232883</url></doc>
