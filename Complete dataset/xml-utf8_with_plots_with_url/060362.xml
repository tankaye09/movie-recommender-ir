<plot>The only son of the Royal Astrologer, Narsin (Om Prakash) namely Gopal (Bharat Bhushan) is not interested in astrology but in music and songs, much to the dismay of Narsin. Gopal's talents are well-known and he could become the Emperor's Chief Musician if he wins in the contest. His rivals live next door, and in order to win the approval of the emperor (Chandrashekhar), they poison Gopal's drink, and Gopal loses his voice completely. His mom (Leela Chitnis) is sorry at the loss of his voice. A young dancing girl, Gopi (Nimmi) takes interest in Gopal, and through her help and a hard knock on the head, he recovers his voice. But Gopal's challenges are far from over, and he will be called upon to prove his worth, as well as his association with Gopi.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060362</url></doc>
