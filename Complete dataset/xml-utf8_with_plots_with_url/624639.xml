<plot>Documentary about Ashkan Panjahee from Iran who came to Denmark four years ago as a 18 year-old, seeking asylum. He was sent straight back to Iran by Danish police with the message: "Try to keep a low profile". Now, four years later he turns up in Denmark again, claiming he just barely escaped 2 years of prisonment in Iran, full of with torture and nightmarish experiences. He is afraid of being escorted back by Danish authorities. His only hope is that he can prove he truly has been tortured, but he's not sure he can cope with the extremely slow progress of his case. A critical documentary questioning the way the Danish asylum system works.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624639</url></doc>
