<plot>Here's the scene: two bumbling burglars, Harry and Marv a.k.a the Wet Bandits, are attempting to break into Kevin McCallister's house. Nobody else is home and Kevin has called the police, but it's gonna take 20 minutes for the police to come, so Kevin's got to dodge these two until the boys in blue can come and take them to the slammer. Think you can handle only two bandits? Think again! Harry and Marv are skilled in robbing houses and disposing of young kids, but they are also clumsy, so you can set traps for them around the house, including the basement and the treehouse! But be cautious! They can turn up anywhere, even right behind you!! You only get one chance, so don't blow it or you have to start all over!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243822</url></doc>
