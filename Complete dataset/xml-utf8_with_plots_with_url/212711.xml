<plot>"George and the Rhino" is the charming real-life story of George Phiri, a game scout and tracker who has dedicated his life to protecting the endangered black rhinoceros in Africa. From early childhood, George witnessed the effects of poaching on the rhino population in his home country of Malawi but could do nothing to stop it. Some twenty years ago, George left his birthplace and took a job in the South African Parks as monitor of its Pilanesberg rhino project. Now, some twenty years later, George is helping to realize his lifelong dream of seeing black rhinoceros reintroduced to Malawi in the hope of starting a new population. This film chronicles the story of George from his early childhood days through the successful relocation of his favorite rhino "Chimpanye" in Malawi. A compelling story, "George and the Rhino" shows the fulfillment of living one's lifelong dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212711</url></doc>
