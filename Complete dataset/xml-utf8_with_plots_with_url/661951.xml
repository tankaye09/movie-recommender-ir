<plot>An early starter in the night club business, Li Wah was a hostess at 16 and a madam at 19. Now, at the ripe old age of 29, she feels it's too early for retirement, but too late for true love. There is only room in her heart for her 16-year-old son. Born out of wedlock, and brought up in the sleazy world of porn and crime, he naturally falls in with the wrong crowd, and proves to be her ultimate undoing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?661951</url></doc>
