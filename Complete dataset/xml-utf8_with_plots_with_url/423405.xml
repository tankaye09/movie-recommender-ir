<plot>They're the PJs - the US Air Force's Pararescuemen, the best trained combat search and rescue teams the US military has to offer. The very same highly trained heroes depicted in Sebastian Junger's best-selling book The Perfect Storm, they're the guys who come to the rescue when no one else will dare. Parachuting behind enemy lines to rescue a crew from the burning wreckage of a plane, dropping straight into a SCUBA dive to rescue a sailor from drowning, or even crawling under a collapsed section of highway to save a civilian, It's their job to bring the wounded to safety -- anytime, anywhere. With unprecedented access to the team, Pararescuemen: That Others May Live gets inside this elite unit to uncloak their tactics, training and technology.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423405</url></doc>
