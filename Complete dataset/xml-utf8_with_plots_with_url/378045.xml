<plot>For his 21st birthday, Chris' friend Derrick hires a call girl to relieve him of his virginity. Reluctantly he goes along with it, but emotions become more complex when the call girl turns out to be his "one true love" from high school, Brooke. Not recognizing him at first, Brooke continues with business as usual and Chris must decide the reality of his ultimate fantasy. Is Brooke a prom queen or a streetwalker? Will Chris profess his true feelings, or just "hit that?" Will Derrick ever get that damn bottle of wine open? Answers lie within. Pictures fade and pedestals fall as this film explores the difference between loving someone and truly knowing them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378045</url></doc>
