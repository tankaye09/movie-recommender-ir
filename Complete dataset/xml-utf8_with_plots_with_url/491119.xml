<plot>Dharamraj Verma and his two younger brothers, Dinki and Dino, run a garage with the help of a trained monkey and a "Herbie-type" car named dhug dhug. Since Dharamraj dislikes woman, he has not married and will not also permit his brothers to woo any woman, leave alone marry them. But when Dino &amp; Dinki fall in love with Air India Hostesses Renu and Radha respectively, things come to a boil between the brothers and as a result they decide to split. Dinki and Dino board dhug dhug, who takes them to a bungalow. Puzzled they come out of the car and wonder why dhug dhug would stop here of all places. Then a servant named Ramu, who they have seen with Dharamraj on several occasions, tells them why dhug dhug stopped outside this bungalow. It is here all mysteries will be clarified for these two brothers, and it is here they will learn why Dharamraj distrusts women, and why he refuses to marry or permit them to marry any woman. They do not know that from this point on things will never be the same for the three brothers and their garage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491119</url></doc>
