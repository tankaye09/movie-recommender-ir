<plot>A very fine picture showing the crews of the above mentioned High School leaving their boat house. The two crews then pull out for a distance of about a mile, and begin an exciting race toward our camera, passing the field of our instrument within half a boat length of each other. A very pretty and interesting picture with beautiful water effects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660614</url></doc>
