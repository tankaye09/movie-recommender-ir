<plot>When Terrell McFarland decides to invite his four closest friends from college to his new home, he meant it to be a chance to reunite with each other and reminisce on the past. All five men have become very successful since their college days - Russ is a major hip-hop music producer, Leroy is a leading African American scholar, Joey was a standout NFL football player, and Kendrick is a prominent doctor. It is like old time when they gather in Terrell's house joking and teasing each other, but as they say 'old memories never die'. When Karen Worthy, a woman from their college days they all shared a relationship with, appears unannounced, the atmosphere grows hauntingly intense. Casual conversation turns into harsh accusations of how they each mistreated her and Terrell unveils a startling revelation that leads to one damning confession that may crucify them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006288</url></doc>
