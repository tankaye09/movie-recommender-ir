<plot>Victor is a man with a past which, although he keeps it hidden, leads him to lead a curiously nocturnal life. Will is a young man who has paused his own life to care for his mother, who wants only to die with dignity, and soon. At odds with his sister Cathie due to her conservative religious beliefs, Will escapes to the movies where he meets Victor. The two become emotionally entangled as they work to help Gertrude die, but must suffer the wrath of Cathie. When she confronts Victor and Will, all hell breaks loose!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603998</url></doc>
