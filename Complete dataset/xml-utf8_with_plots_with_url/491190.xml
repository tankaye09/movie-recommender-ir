<plot>The story of a courageous painter who, along with her friends Jackson Pollock and Willem deKooning, was a key figure in the Abstract Expressionist movement in American art. A major artist who refused to be categorized, Grace Hartigan continually invented and reinvented herself and her style and persevered in the face of profound personal and professional challenges: a very public falling out with Clement Greenberg, one of the most influential art critics of the time; an attempted suicide; an estrangement from her only child; and the long, tragic illness and death of her beloved (and 4th) husband. Against the background of one the most explosive periods in American art history, this film celebrates a fiercely independent painter whose life was as gutsy and compelling as her art.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491190</url></doc>
