<plot>"I don't want to give the impression that the entire thing was a disaster. I mean it was. But maybe there's something to be said for being in over your head." Daniel has a crush which has taken over his life. To make matters worse, he's moving into a house on a street with her name. In the end it's not her ex-boyfriend rockstar, her singing dog or Daniel's housemates that will help him make sense of it all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233539</url></doc>
