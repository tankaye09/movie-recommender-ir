<plot>Mankind has yet to discover a breed of aliens unlike anything in it's wildest imagination. On a planet far from earth, a small moist planet known as Eyeland, a planet inhabited only by small levitating creatures, an evil plot is about to come to fruition. A species of eyeballs, known amongst themselves as Eyebaliens, with an ultimate mission, to study earth and eventually infiltrate our planet, are about to be unleashed upon the world. One major obstacle stands in their way. In their study of earth, the Eyebaliens failed to realize that mankind had long ago embarked on a path of self-destruction. As the Eyebaliens humor themselves with earthlings life-style, they do not realize they are coming to mimick the mistakes and the very behavior that led them to believe earthlings were far inferior. They are small, they are round, they see everything. Or do they?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?556178</url></doc>
