<plot>At no point in history did anyone ever say being a father was easy. For Urog, caveman and father of two particuarly apt kids, fatherhood is nothing short of an everyday adventure. Kirss and Kreg are talented far beyond their young years would insinuate. They possess an aptitude for everything they do and are truly the next step in evolution. The only problem is Urog, their father, hasn't quite caught on to that. Although meaning well, Urog is stunting his childrens progress and must finally realize that life is an evolving matter. And kids can't be kids forever. Set against the warming backdrop of pre-historic times, Caveman is a heart felt tale about love and the family unit in the midst of change and progress. Featuring stunning 3D animation and a beautiful musical score, Caveman is an important tale for the ages that reminds us how precious time spent with loved ones can be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097315</url></doc>
