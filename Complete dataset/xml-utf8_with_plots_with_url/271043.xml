<plot>In World War One a large number of Russian prisoners-of-war was sent to South Jutland, at that time a part of Germany. Many prisoners were ordered to work at "danish" farms as a replacement of ten men who were called to join the army. The movie tells the story about their fate and about their attempts to escape across the nearby danish border.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271043</url></doc>
