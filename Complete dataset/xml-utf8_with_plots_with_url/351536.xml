<plot>The movie revolves around the problem of an important principle that has been missing from the minds and hearts of many Egyptian youth nowadays, that is loyalty to the motherland. The movie tackles this problem through the personality of Hussain Amin who has left the country and lost all his loyalty to it. His country has become nothing to him except a few letters typed on his passport. Amin who has developed a serious criminal personality, is recruited by his country to stop a big terrorist operation but of course his problems with loyalty stand as obstacles at first. Hussain is finally convinced of the importance of his loyalty to his country and that he should do anything to protect and defend it. The action and violence-filled movie is covered with a love story that grows between Hussain and Mariam and reaches its peak with Hussain stopping the terrorist operation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351536</url></doc>
