<plot>After the death of his father, troubled teen JAKE GATTISON travels with his mother to Harmony Ranch, a special retreat for families dealing with problems. There, Jake discovers a kindred spirit in Troubadour, a young stallion that has lost his mother and is acting out, unsettled and distressed. Ranch owner CHIEF, works to calm the uneasy horse. Jake witnesses Chief's determination with the stallion, and begins to see the wisdom in the old man's words and deeds-lessons he can apply to his own life. When Troubadour suddenly runs away, Jake makes it his mission to bring the lost stallion home. The ranch hand GREYWOLF explains to Jake the Native American legend of Heaven's Pathway, a mountain that towers over Harmony Ranch, said to be a place where wounded souls go to find peace. With this knowledge, Jake sets out with his new friends NICKI and ISAAC, two other troubled teens, on a journey to the top of Heaven's Pathway in search of Troubadour. The adventure challenges the three teens as never before. Jake, Nicki, and Isaac travel up the mountain bearing the burdens of their weaknesses, fears, and painful pasts. . . but they return with their lives changed forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343664</url></doc>
