A struggling newspaper, Adarsh Times, publishes a story about her being born in an orphanage, which is received with shock and surprise by Vivek, and he instructs his lawyers to file a defamation suit against the owner, known as Dada, and a Journalist, Jay Bhardwaj. Dada and Jay are apologetic, however, Sarina finds out that she is not Vivek's biological daughter, and sets forth to find her parentage. She enlists Jay's assistant and they travel to Ooty where they meet with a Catholic Priest, Joseph, who refuses to divulge any information to them. Then she meets with a Nun, Sister Namrata, and subsequently finds out that she is indeed her biological mother. Expecting to be welcomed into her arms, she is shocked when Namrata outright rejects her, and tells her to return to back to her life with Vivek.
