<plot>Shanti Swarup is a businessman and lives a wealthy lifestyle with his three sons, Ram, Shyam, and Sunder; his wife, Parvati; widowed sister, Devki; an unmarried daughter, Geeta; and a devoted servant named Kanhaiya. Parvati would like Sunder to get married to a former rich man's daughter, Laxmi, but Sunder chooses to marry a maid-servant, Rachna, and as a result Laxmi gets married to Kanhaiya. Shanti has arranged for Geeta to marry his friend, Lala Karamchand's son, Ramesh. Financial losses occur, Shanti loses all his wealth, his sons, Ram and Shyam, refuse to assist him in any way, &amp; Karamchand cancels the wedding. Disheartened, depressed and unable to face the world, he passes away. Now their palatial home is to be auctioned by a greedy Karamchand, a devastated Parvati is on her deathbed as she cannot think of living elsewhere, and it is only a miracle that can save this wretched family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?364120</url></doc>
