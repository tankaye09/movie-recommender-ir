<plot>Vijay Sharma lives a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay along with his wife, Radha, son, Munna, and sister, Manju, who is dumb since birth; and works as a C.I.D. Police Inspector. When the Commissioner of Police is killed, he is assigned this investigation, and comes across evidence that may lead him to the killer. He submits this evidence to Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ashwini Kamble, and keeps two negatives with him. Then his wife's friend, Kiran, also a C.I.D. Inspector comes to live with them, leading to a series of comical misunderstandings, which turn tragic when Vijay finds out that Radha has cancer. He decides to travel to America to have her treated, but a bomb blast kills her. Devastated, he decides to bring in the killer, but before that a young man, Amar, approaches him for Manju's hand, and he gets them married. The evidence against the Commissioner's killer is tampered with, and Vijay is not able to locate the negatives. Shortly thereafter, Manju and Amar are killed, and Vijay is arrested for killing them. He is tried in Court, found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison - leaving his young son virtually alone to fend for himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275176</url></doc>
