<plot>MAIDEN DREAMS is the award winning television documentary following the career of a thoroughbred racehorse as he developed from an untrained yearling into a top class champion. The story focuses on a group of dedicated owners who waited 25 years to have a champion horse. Every year they bought one horse with the hopes that one day they might stand in the winner's circle of a top graded race. With the help of their devoted trainer, the owners finally saw their dreams come true, when they competed in Canada's crown jewel of racing, The Queen's Plate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352671</url></doc>
