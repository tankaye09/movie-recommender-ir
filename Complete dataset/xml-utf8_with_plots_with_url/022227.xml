<plot>In the fourth century AD, a monk named John Cassian wrote in detail of the eight deadly sins. In the 20th century, deacon Simon Corbett will be questioned as to the discrepancy by a creature who is old enough to know better. &lt;i&gt;"Acedia, the eighth and most insidious of sins, that the church has stolen--for if it were made available, every knowledgeable finger would rise to point in accusation of the truth: that this exalted, miraculous vessel, charged with the inspiration of life, has become so enamored with the riches of heaven and the hatred of earth that it is now truly indifferent, cold and resigned that life here is nothing even in the living of it, and all will go on with or without it so long as there is time that creeps..."&lt;/i&gt; Taking an unlikely approach to addressing spiritual apathy within the church, Acedia is simultaneously an indictment and directive--a message that life, no matter how long lived, is nothing if merely endured.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022227</url></doc>
