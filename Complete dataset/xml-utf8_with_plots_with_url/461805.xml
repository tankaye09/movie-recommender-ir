<plot>Shangri-La to hell in ten years: How did Nepal, a peaceful landlocked country, become home to the most dramatic Maoist insurgency in modern history? "RETURNED: Child Soldiers of Nepal's Maoist Army" follows several Nepali boys and girls as they attempt to reintegrate into civil society after fighting with the Maoists in the "People's War." The film confronts Maoist leaders and examines why these children are compelled to join armed groups. The film explores the prevention of future recruitment through the voices of former child soldiers and experts in the field.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461805</url></doc>
