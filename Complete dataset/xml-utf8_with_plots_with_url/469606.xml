<plot>It is a special train equipped by the Canadian Pacific Railway for carrying the Duke and Duchess of York and royal party from Montreal to Vancouver. It is made up of ten coaches and five heavy mountain climbing engines. The road which goes over Mt. Hector has the steepest grade of any in North America. The engines suddenly come into view around a bend at a distance of about one-half mile, sending up huge volumes of smoke from each of the stacks. On the front of the first locomotive can be plainly seen the lookouts who travelled the entire distance from coast to coast keeping sharp watch for obstructions which might be placed on the tracks by miscreants. This picture, besides being of great historical interest, gives the audience the most novel and stirring train scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469606</url></doc>
