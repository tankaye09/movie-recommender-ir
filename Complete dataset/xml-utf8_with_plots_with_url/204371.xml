<plot>in 1991 Juliette, GA was a lone street with buildings covered with Kudzu. An antique store was open on the weekends and a tiny restaurant was opened for breakfast and lunch. After a Hollywood movie came through and added $250,000 construction to the ailing structures, turning the antique store into a fictional restaurant, the town's owner turned that restaurant into non fiction. 15 years later, although the owner was told he would go out of business, the Whistle Stop Cafe and other shops thrive, and the town brings in 25,000 visitors a year. In 2006, Danny Vinson and four of his friends visit this most famous town saved by Hollywood. They go down Juliette's McCracken St. and speak with the local people. Stories are told about their business, their town, and the movie that put it all on the map. Also, an engaging historical look at the town is given with images from an hundred years earlier. Danny and his friends are so consumed by the magic of the town's charm and history that they end up dressed in period costumes. In character and in a lighthearted fashion they visit the movie's most famous areas .</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?204371</url></doc>
