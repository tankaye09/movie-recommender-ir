<plot>Two old cronies, one a phlegmatic Dutchman, are sitting at a table. The Dutchman fails to see a joke in the paper, so his companion tries a realistic joke by pouring the contents of a bottle of ink into the Dutchman's pipe. The latter starts to smoke and gets a mouthful of ink. He quickly avenges himself, however, by blowing the ink into his companion's face. An exceedingly laughable finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009935</url></doc>
