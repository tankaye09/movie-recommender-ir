<plot>Lorna Moon is 17. She goes to school, likes parties, and lives with her mother and her little brother Jamie. Life should be pretty simple right? Except of course, for the messy divorce of her parents, and her desire to hide her growing eating disorder - oh, and the unwanted attentions of a trio of cruel bullies. And most disturbingly of all, her growing suspicion that all is not as it seems in her bedroom at home, a ghostly apparition that appears to her in her mirror. Tormented and terrified, she begins to call her own sanity into question (naturally, there are no such things as ghosts. . . ) Young and vulnerable Lorna Moon has a secret. Feeling alone and with no one to turn to, she finds herself being powerfully drawn to a man whose love she should never hope to have - a man fast turning out not to be all he seems. And then there's the mysterious next-door neighbor, a reclusive, creepy old man (Leslie Phillips), who knows more than he is willing to say. As this pulsating tale draws to its nerve-wracking climax, will he reveal his awful secret in time to save Lorna's life?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?646513</url></doc>
