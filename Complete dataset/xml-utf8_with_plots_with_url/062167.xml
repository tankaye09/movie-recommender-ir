<plot>In this daily syndicated revival of the durable game show, two male-female couples competed, with the aid of a celebrity guest, to complete various stunts within a time limit. The time limit was usually 60 seconds or less, depending on the stunt. As with the network series, the stunts (often messy) were the centerpiece of the show. Examples of stunts included putting on oversized underwear and then stuffing 12 balloons into it without breaking any; springing six mouse-traps using a large sausage tied to a fishing pole, and the partner freeing the mouse-traps; and throwing three custard pies through a wooden cutout that their mate stood behind, while the pie-thrower was blindfolded. A huge on-stage clock counted down the seconds, as the host provided commentary and encouragement. Couples succeeding in completing their stunt were taken to a large board to choose a letter in the show's title; behind each letter was a cash prize ranging from $25 to $200. Each couple competed in two stunts per show, plus the bonus stunt at the end of the show. Between each round, the celebrity guest tried to complete his/her own stunt, with the couples winning $50 for correctly predicting if the celebrity would complete the stunt within the time limit. Both couples competed in the grand-prize stunt to decide the day's winner. The winning couple received $500 and a prize package. The show was the only Goodson-Todman show ever taped in Canada.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062167</url></doc>
