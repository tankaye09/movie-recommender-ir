<plot>There has been an increase in movies falling in the genre of indian-hinglish movies that are being made by young Indian directors who want to express their creativity through the medium of films. The making of such films bring a freshness to the indian movie scene. That said, some of them lack a strong storyline and this happens to be failing of this "Freaky Chakra" too. "Freaky Chakra" is the story of a lady (Deepti Naval) and the vicious circle of life that she leads. The story has a novel presentation style done by Ranvir Shorie where he introduces the characters one after another and talks to the audience from time to time. It is funny at times like where we see a character about to swallow bills and Ranvir butts in with " oops Typo :Pills, pills ... not bills"!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203009</url></doc>
