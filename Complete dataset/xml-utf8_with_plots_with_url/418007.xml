<plot>When the lifeless body of the local mailman is discovered beside a stack of opened letters he was reading, just a stone's throw away from the sign "Welcome To Lowry, Iowa - Population 423 - Sin Free Since 1973", you get the feeling that village life is about to change. When small-town hypocrisy meets big-city crime, you get the feeling that sparks are bound to fly. Change it does, and fly they do, leading the locals on a hilarious wild-goose chase through the Iowa cornfields in search of the mailman's diary, which chronicles all the town's dirty little secrets. When the smoke clears, the good, the bad, and the very-good-at-being-bad will be exposed, ultimately changing the town - or what's left of it - forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418007</url></doc>
