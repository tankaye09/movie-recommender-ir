On his journey to find his wife, Harry begins to experience things that disturb him. Are they hallucinations, is he losing control? His mind is letting him down, he has lost parts of his memory and it's holding him back. A mysterious woman at the airport agrees to help Harry find his wife. But the closer Harry gets to finding the whereabouts of his wife the deeper he enters a world where sometimes the truth is best left alone. His mind is slowly falling apart as he starts to untangle the dark disturbing truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201935</url></doc>
