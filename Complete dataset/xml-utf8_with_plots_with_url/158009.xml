<plot>A German beer garden. A rather stout customer comes in and seats himself at a table close to the wall. He pulls out a long-stemmed pipe and lights it. He gives the waiter an order for a stein of beer, and when it is served he takes a sip and then picks up a paper. "Happy Hooligan" and "Gloomy Gus" appear at the top of the fence. One of them "hooks" the mug of beer with a walking cane. After drinking the beer they replace the mug on the table. When the German finds that his beer has disappeared he proceeds to scold the waiter. Another stein is brought and placed on the table. Hooligan and his brother tramp also win this by using the German's pipe-stem as a siphon. The German upon again finding the glass empty when he wants to drink, becomes enraged, but the saloonkeeper quiets him by producing another stein of beer. This time Hooligan secures a sponge and by forcing it into the mug of beer succeeds in getting the third drink away from their victim. This time the German gets so mad at tricks he thinks the bartender is playing on him that he leaves the place in a rage. A policeman now appears and arrests Happy Hooligan. While the waiter is chasing the German, Gloomy Gus leaps over the fence and enjoys the free lunch left on the table.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158009</url></doc>
