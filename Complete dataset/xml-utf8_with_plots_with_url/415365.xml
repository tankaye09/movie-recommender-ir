<plot>"Oregon Kara Ai" or "From Oregon with Love", is about a nine year boy, Akira, who is sent to live in rural Central Oregon with his aunt and her family after his parents are killed in a traffic accident. Making the adjustment is not easy at first, but as the story unfolds, Akira courageously learns to face the challenges of his new life, and begins to understand the differences between Japanese and American culture. As he progresses on his adventures he "narrates" the story through letters to his sister who remained behind in Tokyo. Filled with heartwarming scenes of the love and support of his new family and the kindness of their neighbors, this drama became a hit series which ran for 13 episodes in 1984 and was followed by 8 one hour specials in 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92 and 1996. The scenery is stunning and helped form the basis of the Japanese peoples knowledge of the State of Oregon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?415365</url></doc>
