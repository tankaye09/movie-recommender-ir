<plot>Even though the first mission against the Bydo Empire was an apparent success, the latest deep-space probes have revealed a secret Bydo base. It appears that the Empire has been in seclusion since it's headquarters were destroyed, stockpiling weapons and resources. Once more, the Earth is under threat of attack from the extra-terrestrial mutants and the world government needs you to fight back...again. The bio-mechanical aliens of the evil Bydo Empire are back, many of the bosses from the original R-Type are repeated (albeit in slightly different guises) and the distinctive pastel shades of the original are used again to create an immediately familiar feel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452500</url></doc>
