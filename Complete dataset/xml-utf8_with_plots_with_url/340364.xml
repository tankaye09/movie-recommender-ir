<plot>Leo is a simple man with his wife, Amy, and two year old son Jack, living the iconic Middle American life. One day Leo awakens to a sound that comes from seemingly nowhere, pushing him to build a mysterious machine in his garage, which quickly becomes an obsession. Leo spins into a world of science and physics where he cannot comprehend what he is building yet cannot stop himself from creating it. As Leo tumbles over the edge of sanity, and the story unfolds, he finds himself at an intersection that defies logic and redefines the understanding of human existence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340364</url></doc>
