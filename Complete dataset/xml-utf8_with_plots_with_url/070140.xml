<plot>Late at night, deep in the woods of Washington State, Todd Limberg recorded an eerie howl on his camcorder. He thinks it might be Bigfoot. Is it? Let's ask the experts: Tom Biscardi; Bigfoot entrepreneur, says he will capture Bigfoot "within the next 48 hours". - Jeff Meldrum, Bigfoot Anthropologist, explains the mid-tarsal break, and why some footprints might not be hoaxed - Don Monroe, The 'Indiana Jones' of Idaho, takes us into The Cave of Bigfoot. - Thom Powell: "I try to get Bigfoot to come to me.": Powell has transformed his yard into a 20-acre Bigfoot trap; complete with everything Bigfoot could want - and more: hidden cameras. - Neal Burgstahler is in contact with the 'Invisible Bigfoot'. His photographs of 'Bigfoot Orbs' that he took in the forest at night "prove" that Bigfoot lives in the realm of the inter-dimensional. - MK Davis will demonstrate that the 1967 Patterson/Gimlin Bigfoot film footage is real. - Peggy Marx is the widow of reputed Bigfoot Hoaxer Ivan Marx. Did she really film Bigfoot?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070140</url></doc>
