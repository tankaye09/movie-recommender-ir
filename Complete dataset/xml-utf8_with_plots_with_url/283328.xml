<plot>What happens when five inexperienced dog owners each adopt a dog from the pound and then attempt to train their new companions in some basic and advanced dog commands and maneuvers? K9 Nation is a funny, energetic and educational look at the events surrounding these five novice dog-handlers and their new-found 'best friends' as they learn how to communicate dog-to-man and man-to-dog. The five teams will use their new "sporting dog" skills to compete for a grand prize at the season's end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?283328</url></doc>
