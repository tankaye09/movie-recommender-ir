<plot>What happens when you give 14 self-confessed nerds three months of intensive and professional football training and then have them play a leading national league team? Elite coach Andy Harper takes 14 self-confessed nerds into the grueling world of professional football and heads up the transformation of the boys whose usual obsessions are more circuit boards, naval history and robotics than football. The question that is asked at the start of this hilarious and warm-hearted series is: can three months of intense training prepare these 14 young men, all complete novices, to compete against all-star team? Over eight episodes, the players undergo tough physical training and become the fittest they have ever been. Mixed into their already busy schedule of learning rules and tactics are matches against surprising teams that will truly test their focus and strength of character. Throughout the series the Nerds have the aspirational goal of taking on one of this country's strongest and most talented sides - Melbourne Victory. The purpose of the program is to take mice and turn them into men, to give the self-confessed nerds a sense of team spirit, to give them the courage to tackle the unknown and to have a lot of fun along the way...but winning isn't everything to Nerds FC.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393186</url></doc>
