<plot>Atlantic City, a.k.a Hard City, is littered with the broken dreams and dashed hopes of every two-bit hustler who thought he could make his mark on the world with a dollar and dream. Just below the sparkling facade of this gambling town, there lies a darker world that can give rise to great power, unless the dirt on your suit starts to show. But just like the roulette tables in the nearby casinos, the odds of making it in A.C. are never in your favor. While many try to shine bright, most burn out like the darkened neon lights that hang in abandoned store fronts. The rules are different here. Rebecca's Window is a story of a group of individuals hustling to create a better life for themselves despite their troubled pasts, and will go to unimaginable lengths to make their dreams reality. They want the world at their fingertips, but no one thought the choices they made could destroy their dreams before they ever took shape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457418</url></doc>
