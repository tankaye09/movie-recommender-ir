<plot>A boy wanders among the trains in a depot. A young man is traveling and the boy asks him to follow him. An elderly woman has transformed her house into a train carriage and talks to her husband who died years ago. El Dorado is what we constantly seek and never find. It's a dream and perhaps that's why it's so real. The boy and the young man play on the banks of a lake and find an old car half-buried in the sand of some beach. They could even continue their journey with this means of transportation. The elderly woman in her train carriage-home continues her own journey to the past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174782</url></doc>
