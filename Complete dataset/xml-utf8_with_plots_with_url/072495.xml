<plot>Black and White 2002 Los Angeles Film Festival Black and White is a chronicle of the portrayal of African Americans in the media from the perspective of today's youth. If you ever wondered whats on the mind of our kids.. this short film give you an insight that all is not lost within the over-indulgent "its all about me" generation. While some moments are particularly bitter pills to swallow, we must remember that the film takes a view that most of white American is not able to experience. Perhaps the age of the filmmaker, only 16 at the time. Gives us a glimpse of our present and past with unflinching honesty that can only been seen through the eyes of youth, not yet filtered by political correctness. How refreshing! Because we all will be ultimately judged by future generations. We should be mindful of the paper or video trail we leave behind Black and White offers a substantial platform into who and what we are.. as a race, as a people and humanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072495</url></doc>
