<plot>Also known as "Small Miracles", released by Questar, Inc in 2004. This quietly lovely film won Best Film at the Austin and Berlin International Film Festivals, and tells the profoundly moving story of 12-year old Taliesin Jones, who struggles with the chaos of his life, while struggling to come to terms when his mother suddenly leaves the family home. His father has become distant, his brother has become angry and bitter, while Taliesin dives into the world of his imagination looking for solace. After witnessing his piano teacher heal a woman's ailing back with the power of prayer, Taliesen begins a spiritual quest. He forms a secret society at his school, "The Believers". But his attempts to heal a classmate and his teacher's grave illness leave him feeling lost and confused, and test his newfound faith. This film is more than a "coming of age" film - it is the tale of everyone who's ever tried to make sense of things that just can't be made sense of, and the grace that fills our lives when we go looking for it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?595467</url></doc>
