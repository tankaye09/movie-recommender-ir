<plot>The geoduck ("gooey duck") clam sports a phallic, three-foot-long neck and a life span of 160-plus years. It's jokingly referred to as the Washington State Bird. 3 FEET UNDER explores how the geoduck has inspired a quirky yet devoted following in the Pacific Northwest. We follow "Jack," a long-time Seattleite who was raised in a kosher Brooklyn home, as he prepares for his annual geoduck dig. Jack's commentary on his pursuit of the King of Clams propels the action through many layers of geoduck subculture: college mascots, songs, sushi recipes, strict regulation, and the notorious Clamscam trials.</plot><plot>The geoduck ("gooey duck") clam sports a phallic, three-foot-long neck and a life span of 160-plus years.
