<plot>Seemingly alone in his father's sleek Manhattan apartment, motherless Oliver is woken by the sounds of sex, and quickly finds that his father has brought home a young woman. Oliver then embarks on a mission to seduce her into becoming his mother. After a successful ambush, Oliver convinces the nameless woman to sit with him while he draws her portrait; he soon discovers that she too grew up in the absence of a parent. The two make a connection that triggers a sexual awakening in Oliver, blurring the lines between sexual desire and maternal longing. Their union is tested when Oliver's father discovers their association.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576535</url></doc>
