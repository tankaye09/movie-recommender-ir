<plot>Two naughty schoolgirls, Penny and Jane, are sent to the Detention Room for punishment where they meet the Headmaster and School governor Mr. Elliot, who warns them their behavior will not be tolerated. The Headmaster devises a series of tests for the girls and any slip-ups lead to their skirts being pinned up and knickers removed. Jane's knickers are even pinned to the blackboard. Mr. Elliot and the Headmaster spank the girls together and then the Headmaster canes them one after another as they kneel on a stool. Jane finds the cane hard to take and has a tantrum.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?142965</url></doc>
