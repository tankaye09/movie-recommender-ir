<plot>'So we sleepwalked through this incongruous life, a life we were not made for. ' Various self-interests and private passion, oftentimes under foreign direction or influence, controlled the official history of a small country like Bulgaria. However, the hope and aspiration of the people seem to be most sincerely summed up by ordinary's people letters. The film is based on the fragments from the archives of prominent personalities of the past (like Ekaterina and Lora Karavelova)as well as those of quite ordinary women. The features of the documentary and the fiction have been combined in an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of an entire small world with its expectations, chimeras and disappointments.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525894</url></doc>
