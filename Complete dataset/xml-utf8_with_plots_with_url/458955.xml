<plot>The films follows a Hungarian refugee arriving in London, speaking no English and with little money, the only prospect of help being an address given to him by a fellow refugee. He makes poignant observations about British society, playing the critical flanuer. Finally, after much disappointment, he finds the correct address and receives food and shelter. This film was shown as part of the last Free Cinema programme, Free Cinema 6. It was screened alongside Michael Grigdby's 'Enginemen' (1959), Karel Reisz's 'We Are the Lambeth Boys' and Elizabeth Russell's surrealist 'Food For A Blusssssh'. It certainly follows the documentary style characteristic of the movement, and the attitude of 'the importance of people...significance of the everyday' (Free Cinema Manifesto 1956). It is also thematically comparable to Mazzzetti's 'Together' (1956), as the outsider figures are taking the place of protagonist.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458955</url></doc>
