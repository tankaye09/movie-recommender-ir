<plot>Focused around the sale of a family-run auto-body shop, Crangle's Collision is a story of dark family secrets being brought into the cold light of day. Mechanic Frank Crangle, already troubled by his wife's infidelity, is crushed with the loss of the business he had waited his whole life to inherit. Full of rage, he commits a crime so heinous the family may never recover. At the same time, Lucy, Frank's younger sister, is involved in a scandalous love affair that is far more taboo than she realizes. Their father, Doc Crangle is now faced with the nearly impossible task of keeping his very dysfunctional family intact while trying to close the largest business deal of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117727</url></doc>
