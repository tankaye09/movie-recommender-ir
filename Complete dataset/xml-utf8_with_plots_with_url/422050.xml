<plot>This scene was taken from the front end of a locomotive running through Leanchoil, B.C., in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, and presents a most beautiful picture. We are continually running along the very brink of the mountains which are thousands of feet high, and far below can be seen the Kicking Horse River as it flows toward the Grand Ca√±on of the Kicking Horse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422050</url></doc>
