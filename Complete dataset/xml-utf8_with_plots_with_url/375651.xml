<plot>"Coaling at dock in Key West. Monitors belong to a class of war ships that is the connecting link between the modern leviathan like the 'Indiana,' and the first type evolved by the genius of Ericsson, and consequently, this picture is an interesting study. Low main deck, heavy armor belt, and revolving turrets. Military tops filled with rapid fire machine guns. A terror in deed as well as in name. Lots of action in picture. Coal car arrives and dumps into chute; another dumps, and away she goes. A bunch of coal passers are seen working further down the wharf. The 'Marblehead' is coaling just beyond. Three sailors watch the work in the foreground and discuss the situation briskly. No collection of pictures complete without this one."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375651</url></doc>
