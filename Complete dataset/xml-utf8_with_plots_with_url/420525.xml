<plot>Thompson desperately needs to find somebody to work his Saturday shift at the hardware store. But his fellow college-age employees aren't exactly coming to his aid, and the store is short staffed ever since his jerkwad boss Gary fired the underperforming Chuck. When the disgruntled and well-armed Chuck returns to take revenge, Thompson and his callous co-worker Hannah get caught in the middle of the rampage. Gary locks himself in a storeroom while Chuck attempts to extricate the frightened manager. Meanwhile, Thompson continues to formulate a way out, while Hannah, a journalism major, decides the situation could be her "fast track to scoring a book deal." Once bullets start to fly, things don't quite work out the way everybody had hoped. Or do they?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420525</url></doc>
