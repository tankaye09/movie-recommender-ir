<plot>Claire, is a smart, best-selling yet cantankerous novelist who has written a new book about weight loss. At the premiere book signing, she makes a phone call to her furious, obese daughter, who is enraged that Claire has dedicated the book to her. The crowd at the book signing is equally angry, as it turns out the volume is totally blank, except for the words "gorge less" on the first page. Her forthrightness made her lose family and friends, so she literally has to rent a friend in order to enjoy someone's company. Crestfallen, Claire shows up on the doorstep of someone she seems to love who has spurned her. She knocks on the door, but nobody opens. As she starts to whine and wail, water is dumped on top of her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?612708</url></doc>
