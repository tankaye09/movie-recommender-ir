<plot>'THE FINAL WORD- The Road to CanSpell' - is a compelling one-hour documentary that will follow the fascinating journey of the regional winners and runners-up through this remarkable competition. MIDCAN'S production crews have been tracking the kids since the regional finals began on March 5th - riding the emotional roller coaster right along with them. We've traveled from Victoria to Montreal and back - documenting stories on winners from each region. We've met their friends, their families, their dogs and their cats. We've talked to teachers, principals, coaches and music instructors - we know these kids and you'll get to know them too. And you'll be amazed by them - their intellect, their aptitude and their grit. And just when you think they're superkids, you'll discover their vulnerabilities too. Everyone is hanging on THE FINAL WORD: the Road to CanSpell . . . an astonishing one hour documentary laced with real life drama.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092265</url></doc>
