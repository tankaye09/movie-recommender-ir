<plot>Jane is a young woman plagued with unquenchable emotional difficulties over her appearance. She rarely leaves the house. Eventually, she looks to a new, more accurate, yet cheaper form of cosmetic surgery using a process of chemical therapy. John has been reluctant that Jane needs anything, but he is not enough to cure Jane. She convinces him it is what she needs to function. John never thought that this process and its pioneer doctor would work incredibly well. Too well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273695</url></doc>
