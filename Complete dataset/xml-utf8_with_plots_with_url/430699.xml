<plot>A wounded man walks alone through a blistering desert wasteland, tormented by memories. Every step is physically and spiritually agonizing until he can no longer stand. He falls. His life passes before his eyes. He crashes into a nearby ditch, where he comes face-to-face with his innermost demon: a life he lived long ago, back to haunt him. Like moisture seeping from every pore, his soul begins to escape his body. Finally, he gives in to his demon. What he thought was his damnation becomes his salvation. His burdens and sorrows are left behind as he transcends into the unknown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430699</url></doc>
