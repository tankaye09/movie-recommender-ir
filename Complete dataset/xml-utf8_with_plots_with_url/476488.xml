<plot>Sher Singh lives with his mother and handicapped sister in Punjab but moves to Mumbai, changes his name to Shekhar, meets Nisha and falls in love. When his mother asks him to return, he explains to Nisha that if he takes her before they are married the people would make an issue of it and promises to return in 4 days. On his return, Shekhar is surprised to find out that the Zamindar's son is ready to marry his sister. His mother tells him that the Zamindar's daughter Sweety loves him from their childhood days. The Zamindar had approached his mother to fix the marriage but she told him that she cannot fix her son's wedding until her daughter is married. Sweety's brother agreed to the marriage for as his mother says, brothers are those who sacrifice everything for their sister's happiness. He has no alternative and marries Sweety. So, during the day Sher Singh stays with Sweety and at night Shekhar stays with Nisha. One day both of them meet Sher Singh and tell him that he cannot go till Shekhar arrives! At that time a person makes an entry who looks like Sher Singh claiming to be Shekhar - what is going on?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476488</url></doc>
