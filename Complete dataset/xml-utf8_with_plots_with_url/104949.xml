<plot>It is the night before Christmas. Tanya, a former mail-order bride from Russia, is craving attention from her husband. Albert evades Tanya's bland hints about the presents, and goes out under a phony pretext. Tanya rummages through Albert's belongings, and stumbles upon two identical Christmas cards with identical declarations of love. Baffled and suspicious, Tanya goes to the kids' room to check up on her five-year-old daughter Alice. Alice is wide-awake, and Tanya tells her a fairy tale. The story is a reflection of Tanya's own banal and farcical life. Bursting with a child's enthusiasm, Alice takes over, and tells a story of her own. As she listens to her daughter, Tanya realizes that Albert's sudden take-off was no mere accident.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104949</url></doc>
