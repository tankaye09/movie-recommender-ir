<plot>A market place in Cairo, Egypt, is here shown. Native women are engaged in selling and disposing of their wares, consisting of bead work, etc. Others are serving coffee to people seated around the tables, and two pretty Egyptian girls are engaged in executing a modified version of the Couchee Couchee dance to the amusement of the onlookers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518099</url></doc>
