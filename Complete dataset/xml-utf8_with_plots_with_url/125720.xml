<plot>A familiar scene on the East Side. An Italian is grinding away on the piano organ and the dance music is greatly appreciated by the children who have gathered around. Two little girls (one [black]) go through a series of fancy steps that would make a vaudeville performer envious. A crowd of men and boys stand around watching. A very clever picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125720</url></doc>
