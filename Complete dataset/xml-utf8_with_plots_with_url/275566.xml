<plot>Jenny is a girl who barely registers a blip on the high school radar, and so flat her bras have Winnie The Pooh on them. She also suffers from severe tonsillitis, and after yet another bout with it she enters the hospital to have her tonsils removed. Alas, there is a mix up at the hospital and she is accidentally given the silicone breasts intended for a stripper. While Jenny doesn't want to attend school, her best friend Courtney sees Jenny's new profile as an opportunity to rule the school - taking Courtney with her. At first Jenny makes a swift ascendancy up the high school ladder of popularity. Honor roll. President. School Play. And finally, the Holy Grail, Head Cheerleader. And with cheerleading comes the attention of the star quarterback. Courtney's plan for Jenny goes awry when the popularity goes to Jenny's head, and she begins to leave Courtney out of her world. Courtney becomes upset and lets Jenny hear about it. Meanwhile, Brian is all over Jenny, and after trying to ravish her in a van, his pukka shells get entangled in Jenny's bra and he suffocates in her breasts. Jenny flees to her female Guidance counselor who makes a sexual pass at her. An angry mob meanwhile has begun a hunt for Jenny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?275566</url></doc>
