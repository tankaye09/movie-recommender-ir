<plot>Lora Karavelova, the wife of the great Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Peyo Yavorov, committed suicide on November 30, 1913. The facts of the suicide committed are still obscure to this day. Almost a century expired from those days, but their tragic romance still stirs interest. For quite some time their stormy love affair had been the talk of the capital. Their married life was brief, but their tragic love has been of interest to several generations now. After Lora's death her relatives and the judiciary fanned a scandal, intending thereby to ruin the reputation of the poet. After the suicide the life of the poet is turned into an inferno. Charged with a murder, he struggles for dear life to prove his innocence. But the public is already influenced by rumors and intrigues, inspired by the case. Spurned by society, tormented by intrigue and innuendo, almost blind after a failed suicide attempt, desperate and utterly destitute and, above all, unable to get over the death of his beloved, on October 16, 1914, a year after the death of his wife, Yavorov again pointed the pistol at his head and shot himself. So ended the life of one of the noblest and most tragic figures in the history of Bulgarian literature. The filmmakers examine the chamber drama of poet against the background of a sophisticated and expert reconstruction of the atmosphere at the beginning of the twenty-century.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135910</url></doc>
