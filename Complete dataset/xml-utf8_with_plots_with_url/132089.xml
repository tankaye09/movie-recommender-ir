<plot>The director of a refuse-disposal company commits frauds with government grants and becomes embroiled in an environmental scandal. When he is up to his neck in problems, his wife tries to drag her husband up from the gutter, but she is also already down there with him. That isn't easy. As the fight with the outside world continues, the battles in their relationship also take on increasingly grim forms.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?132089</url></doc>
