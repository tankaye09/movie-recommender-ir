<plot>"Jane" is a contemporary comedy which chronicles three hectic days in the life of an eccentric, cute and utterly unknown actress in Manhattan. Jane struggles to launch her career, cope with anonymity, and find true love. She finds herself trapped between feelings for Maximilian, the eccentric television star she romanticizes constantly, and Will, the dyspeptic malcontent who tries to impress her. In the end, she must choose between the form of celebrity and the substance of her life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273609</url></doc>
