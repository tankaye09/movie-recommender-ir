<plot>Long ago, a mysterious being known as Hoborg created a world called the Neverhood, made entirely of an odd substance known as "Klay." However, Hoborg was lonely and, using a mystical "life-seed", created a "Klay-man" that he called Klogg. Klogg was evil, however, and stole Hoborg's mystical crown,which was his secret to life-without it, he froze solid! Luckily, Willie Trombone and his pal, Big Robot Bill, used a "life-seed" to create Klaymen. Now, Klaymen must journey throughout the mysterious world that is the Neverhood, solve puzzles, dethrone Klogg, and rescue Hoborg!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578760</url></doc>
