<plot>In the small town of Edison, California, everything is nice and routine. Everyone knows each other, and having a routine life is just fine. Until the day a teenager from the past pops in for a visit. Alex North comes home as if he had never left... 30 years earlier. Even his appearance is... the same. Shaken by old memories and a rumbly ground below the townsfolk of Edison re-live a tragedy buried for 30 years... or more. Blackout's and tremors churn up a murderous event 40 years in the past. Edison will never be the same. Blackout is an old school, fast paced, suspense/thriller. The ground seems unforgiving returning lost loved ones and taking others. You never know who will come back for a visit or who has a ticket into darkness. Where will you be when the lights come back on? An original story by Paul Swearingen A screenplay by Laurie Curtis</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073985</url></doc>
