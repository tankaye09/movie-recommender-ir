<plot>"This scene is in a parlor. A young man is making love to his sweetheart. They quarrel; and the lover turns away in pique. As he turns back, the girl changes like a flash into a skeleton, to her lover's great amazement and terror. While he is still trembling with fear the skeleton vanishes and the girl reappears, smiling and beckoning her lover to return to her side."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?593043</url></doc>
