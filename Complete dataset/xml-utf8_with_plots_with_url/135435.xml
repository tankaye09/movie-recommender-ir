<plot>"Let the Movement Travel" is a documentary film about dreaming of dancing as a metaphor for immigrating. It tells the story of two young Brazilian girls, Rosana and Clarice, who moved to Europe with the dream to study modern dance. After a year in Germany they move to Amsterdam to study at Modern Dance School. As the girls are developing both as dancers and as individuals, their dream is being confronted with realistic problems like immigration laws, lack of money, physical and emotional stress. With commentaries of the director the film makes a parallel between her own experiences as a Brazilian immigrant in Europe for more than 10 years and the fresh experiences of the two girls. The film also shows in close-up a strong friendship as a support to keep a dream alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135435</url></doc>
