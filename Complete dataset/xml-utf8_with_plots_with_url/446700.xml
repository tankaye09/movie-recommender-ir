<plot>This film documents the unprecedented excitement in Washington, D.C. in the days surrounding January 20, 2009, when Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th President of the United States. The filmmakers take viewers to a number of inaugural events, national monuments and the streets of Washington, interviewing a wide range of people along the way: celebrities, executives, politicians, young and old, male and female, gay and straight, a variety of ethnicities, with the primary focus on average people, the so-called man in the street. Viewers will feel and experience the inauguration as the average person did, but they will also hear from celebrities and the young man who helped Obama paint a homeless shelter bedroom on Martin Luther King Day, among others. People are asked what Obama's amazing journey has meant to them and what his story and his family means to them. And, in a unique and inspired twist, all those interviewed are asked to directly address the new President with their comments, questions, concerns, and hopes. The results are emotional, powerful and inspiring.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446700</url></doc>
