<plot>Jack Johnson is the typical 'loser' marked early on in his childhood by the pangs of the female anatomy. After scarring his lower lip during what would have been his first and only kiss, he discovers the joys of cunnilingus as an alternative to kissing lips. Upon testing an experimental and powerful sleep-inducing drug for Dr. Lydia Majora, a professor of Women's Studies, Jack's mind conjures up a plan to finally get what he desires in life, and sees no way of being stopped. With a fresh new outlook on life, Lydia finally sees Jack as more than a clerk, but can love save the day, or will Jack's obsession push him over the edge of sanity? Will Jack sacrifice true happiness for momentary pleasure?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121469</url></doc>
