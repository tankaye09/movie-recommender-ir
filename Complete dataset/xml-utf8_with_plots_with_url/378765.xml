<plot>The location of the game is a winter sports training camp on the side of White Mountain. The player(s) chooses one of the young athletes (or creates his/her own) and competes in all kinds of winter sports. The game is set in the mountains (like the Alps) - all the tracks and locations are nearby. There are 13 different Winter Sports Disciplines and 22 different events (Most Disciplines, like skiing downhill, have 2 different events to play).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378765</url></doc>
