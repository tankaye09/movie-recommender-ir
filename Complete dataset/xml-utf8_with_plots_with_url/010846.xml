<plot>This shows the typical gentleman burglar in evening clothes at work at his trade. His victim has placed his box of valuables in his folding bed, and as the burglar is discovered the bed springs up, apparently securely hiding the treasure and the occupant of the bed. The burglar, however, breaks open the bed with his "jimmy," and easily secures the strong box.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010846</url></doc>
