<plot>Ajit lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his dad, Jwalaprasad, mom, and sister, Rita. While returning by train Jwalaprasad is attacked and a man named Kishan comes to his rescue. Pleased, Jwalaprasad hires him, and also proposes that he get married to Rita. Before that Ajit gets married to Radha, who also comes from a wealthy family. On the day of the marriage, both Ajit and Rita notice that Radha and Kishan appear to know each other. When questioned, both deny this, but Rita observes both of them meeting secretly, and decides to confront Kishan - not realizing that she and Ajit are virtually opening a Pandora's box that will shatter and change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260200</url></doc>
