<plot>An American going to Europe for a rest cure says good-bye to his family, then boards a ship that heads out to sea, where it runs into some rough weather. When they reach Ireland, the man has a mishap, and then in Paris he gets involved in a fracas. As he continues on to his other stops, things continue to get even less restful.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183596</url></doc>
