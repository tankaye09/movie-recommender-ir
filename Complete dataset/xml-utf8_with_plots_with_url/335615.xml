<plot>"Life Reloaded" is an experimental project, which investigates the forms of cinematic language and its metaphors in the context of today's acceleration. In that context the media play an important role. They create a virtual reality which calls 'real" life into question. Here the media are entering the position of highest authority in a Freudian sense: "Father and God in one". However this authority is not based on values, rather on power structures. Due to medial recycling, the quantity of symbols and information which are consumed accumulate, which is perceived as an "echo of reality". The search for the "holy grail" in the technical jungle of the present becomes an abstract time journey through various life phases.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335615</url></doc>
