<plot>A young man, his name is Eike Kusch, walks out of a coffee shop somewhere in Europe and gets stabbed in the back by an unknown person. But he is not dead. He wakes up in a bizarre room and a mysterious voice gives him the chance to change his fate. Equipped with a Digipad, a device which enables time travel, he is sent back to the moment right before his murder. His task is now to change the past so he cannot be killed, and eventually find his murderer. In eight chapters he dies several times and always has to prevent it. He meets interesting people and learns about their history. And in the end he will finally meet the one who tried to kill him.
