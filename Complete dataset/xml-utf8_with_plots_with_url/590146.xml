<plot>Jason Hart has a problem. He recently graduated from an elite business school and his parents have been urging him towards business his entire life, but when he receives a letter from a distinguished banking firm offering him a fantastic job, Jason balks. He has a girlfriend who likes him more than he likes her, and perhaps for the wrong reasons. His family and friends won't stop calling him. He has a graduate degree and a job offer that he has dreamed of his whole life. But for some reason Jason doesn't feel right.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?590146</url></doc>
