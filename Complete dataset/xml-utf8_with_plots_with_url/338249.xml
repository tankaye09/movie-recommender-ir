<plot>Papa is reading his newspaper and his little girl tickles his neck with a long straw. Thinking it is a fly papa "shoos" away the supposed fly with his hand. The tickling continues now on his ear, and papa waves his newspaper round his head. Not yet content, the little mischief maker continues her fun, and the man loses all patience, and makes such a wild commotion that he loses his balance, and falls over backwards, chair and all. Sure to make fun for children, both great and small.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338249</url></doc>
