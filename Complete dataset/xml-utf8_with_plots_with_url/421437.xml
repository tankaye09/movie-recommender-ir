<plot>After slaying a snake to protect his terrified wife, the King of the region loses his vision. Years later, his palace officials find out he can be cured with the help of a Naagmani. The King offers a reward but no one is able to find it. Then his former Senapati's son, Jaidev Manohar Singh, comes forward, goes deep into the forests, right into Naag Lok and finds the Naagmani. He hopes to return back, restore the king's vision, and claim the hand of Rajkumari Sathi as his reward. Misfortune visits him after he is caught stealing the Naagmani by Naagrani, who turns him into an aged and deformed half-human half-beast.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421437</url></doc>
