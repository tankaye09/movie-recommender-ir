<plot>The burro, or pack mule, is an almost indispensable adjunct to the miners in a new country. A long line of these sure-footed animals is seen in this view, loaded with supplies, wending their way toward the spectator. The expansive view of the snow-capped peaks of the distant mountains shows some of the difficulties these persistent animals encountered before reaching the present part of the trail.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087303</url></doc>
