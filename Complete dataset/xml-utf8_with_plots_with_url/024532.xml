<plot>A behind-the-scenes look at the making of Pump, the album that carried Boston band Aerosmith into the nineties. While this video doesn't include album versions of any of the songs from Pump (Columbia did not have control of the rights), it does include extensive footage of the band members perfecting their craft in the studios, as well as interviews with all those involved.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024532</url></doc>
