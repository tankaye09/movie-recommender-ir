<plot>In the early 1800's the Spanish regiments are celebrating their victory over the French Legions of Bonaparte. In the midst of the celebration, Miguel (Frank Latimore), Duke of Canabil, is summoned to his commander's quarters and given the news that his father, and Admiral in the Spanish Navy, has betrayed the crown of Spain by turning his fleet over to the enemy. The stunned Migeul, humiliated and scorned by his regiment, takes a blood oath to find out the truth about his father. His search leads him to the mystery ship "Asuncion", commanded by Ingio de Costa, an unscrupulous, vicious man with a hand for evil. The latter is also trying to get one of his evil hands on the fair Consuelo (Anna Maria Sandri), daughter of the governor of Cadiz.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093422</url></doc>
