<plot>Yo! Diary is a successful series of books for teenagers, written by Jonathan Meres and published in half a dozen different countries. In 2002 it made the leap onto the small screen when The Comedy Unit made a series of the same name, first broadcast on CBBC and later on BBC 1 and BBC 2. There has since been a second series and a total of 26 x 25 minute episodes in all. Yo! Diary - The Series (also written by Perrier-nominated ex-stand up Johnny Meres), takes a wildly comic and offbeat look at the lives of 6 very different teenagers. Using a mixture of video diaries, music and drama to stunning effect, Yo! Diary has been one of the most original and innovative comedy-dramas for children in recent years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?665722</url></doc>
