<plot>The focus of this documentary is the discovery of a unique archaeological site. Joya de Ceren in El Salvador, the town that was buried by volcanic eruption thousands of years ago and was uncovered in 1997. It is the first time we get a glimpse of how the rural Mayans lived. The documentary follows the people to the Maya cities of Copan, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage side in 1980 and Tikal across the border of Guatamala, also famous for its Maya ruins. It documents the lives of the Maya people today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575766</url></doc>
