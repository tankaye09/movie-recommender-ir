<plot>A family-affair wild-life documentary that follows George Graham and his family, wife Sheilah (who IS NOT the writer and Scott Fitzgerald paramour in any size, shape, form or fashion) and their young son and daughter, as they depart California for the Canadian north country well armed with guns and cameras. You have to have both to shoot animals, although wife Sheilah(still not the "Beloved Infidel" Sheilah)bags a couple of cougars with bow-and-arrows. Somebody somewhere thinks a real-life woman played by Deborah Kerr could do that? The kids get some cuddly scenes playing with some orphaned bear cubs, that might have still had parents if the Grahams hadn't been around.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099098</url></doc>
