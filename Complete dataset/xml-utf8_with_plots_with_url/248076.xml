<plot>A man... a simple man. After his wife tragically dies, he is left to wonder what to do with the rest of his life. He steps into the doors of a local dance club and his new life takes off! He is propelled to popularity (especially with the ladies) after he befriends a few DJ's and club owners. Now, with a weekly spot on the local 'Top 10' pop radio station, he has become the talk of the town. An inspiration to many, he has become the 'Grandpa' that a lot of the local club goers never had. Take a look at what you could do if age just wasn't a factor as we follow Billy L. Lewis around for a few days.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248076</url></doc>
