<plot>Decidedly a novelty picture, we might say a rare one as very few of their kind have been taken. We see hundreds of beautiful maidens in procession in a courtyard of the church, led by their priest. It is certainly a grand spectacle and this film will appeal to all refined audiences as being out of the ordinary and very interesting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649456</url></doc>
