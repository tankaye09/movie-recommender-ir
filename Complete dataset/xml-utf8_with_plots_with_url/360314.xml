<plot>They batter down the door of a dwelling and enter, driving the inmates out before them. One is seen to raise a child by the feet, and throwing her over his shoulder, runs off with her. Another drags a woman out by the hair, while a third, with the assistance of several others places a man on a block, and decapitates him. A perfect realistic picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?360314</url></doc>
