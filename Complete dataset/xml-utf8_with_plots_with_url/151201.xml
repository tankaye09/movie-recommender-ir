<plot>Officer Gus Kimball gets out of jail and teams up with a new cameraman, Sam "Fanboy". They pick up right where he left off, harassing local "perps" with a vengeance. But when Gus finds out that his brother Ed has gotten rich off his previous video rampage, he's a man on a mission... Meanwhile, Cousin Simon Cutter has teamed up with Ed and they are making their own video. Simon has been suspended from the police force during an investigation of alleged corruption, and he will stop at nothing to keep his job. He starts by kidnapping the Mayor's daughter and humiliating her on video.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151201</url></doc>
