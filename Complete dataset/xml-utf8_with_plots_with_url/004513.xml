<plot>The intent of California's "Three Strikes and You're Out" law is to make violent criminals into lifetime inmates. However, many believe that the law inflicts unjust and disproportionate life sentences on people who have committed non-violent crimes. In an effort to move public policy by raising public awareness the film will present various social, economic and emotional implications of the law. Ultimately the audience will have to decide if California's "Three Strikes and You're Out" law is practical and just. This is a story of people on all sides of the law: the victims of crime, the inmates who are unreasonably sentenced, and those families who are subject to the law's mechanism through a loved one.</plot><plot>The intent of California's "Three Strikes and You're Out" law is to make violent criminals into lifetime inmates.
