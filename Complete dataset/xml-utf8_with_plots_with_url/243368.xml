<plot>Hollywood Renegade is the life story of novelist and screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who passed away at 95-years-old, still facing the controversy surrounding his conscience-driven decisions to write a novel, "What Makes Sammy Run?", unearthing the moral corruption inside his hometown of Hollywood, and later denouncing the Communist Party in America, testifying at HUAC and naming names of people whom he once shared political ideals with. The son of film pioneer, B.P. Schulberg, Budd grew up a Hollywood prince, but always sided with the underdog and equated writing with fighting. Branded a pariah by L.B. Mayer and the studio heads, Budd Schulberg is the most prolific writer ever to come from Hollywood and this film will take you on his extraordinary journey through a life of epic proportions that's inextricably tied to the history of the 20th century.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243368</url></doc>
