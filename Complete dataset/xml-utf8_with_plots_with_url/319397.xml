<plot>the best movie ever made about a Xicano baller hailing from the Mission District of San Francisco. Sabes que? It is about more than that; it's about choices and consequences; it about snowballs and pandulce; it's about yoga mats and wheat grass; it's about bandanas and stunner shades; it's about making sense of a post colonial landscape; it's about seventeen and a half minutes, and most importantly it is about time. Larry is a guy who is obsessed with hoops, for reasons both metaphysical and historical, even though he is pretty much hopeless as a baller. A Chicano born and raised in the Mission, a barrio under gentro siege, Larry has internalized the reality of occupied Aztlan and can only come to terms with himself on the hoop court. In order to keep his indigenous identity in tact he has created an animal familiar, the eagle. Through basketball he awakens his eagle warrior within.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319397</url></doc>
