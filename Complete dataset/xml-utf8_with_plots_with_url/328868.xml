<plot>It happened in 1950s Taiwan, during the period known as White Terror, when an anti-Communist campaign swept the island and in a hysteria reigned. On one autumn afternoon, two young sisters return from school to find their once-happy home ransacked by military police and their parents arrested and accused of being Communist spies. The film follows a quartet of characters-the dashing air force officer father, his beautiful devoted wife, a mysterious scar-faced bureaucrat and a general's glamorous wife. Their lives and loves intertwine until everything erupts in a rhapsody. Amid life in that turbulent era, friendship, passion, high-minded ideals and dignity are all put on trial in the courtroom of human desire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328868</url></doc>
