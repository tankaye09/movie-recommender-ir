<plot>A white man stranded on the side of the road. A black man speeding by in an SUV. An act of kindness with fatal repercussions. A mysterious backpack. And a twist. Two strangers, harboring dark secrets and deceitful motives, learn how much can change in just thirty miles. 30 Miles follows two men of different race &amp; background on a dramatic pressure-cooker trip. Ernie, a down-on-his-luck drifter, and Anthony, a successful Hollywood agent, find their fates intertwined after a chance meeting. As the men reveal intimate details of their pasts, guards are let down and emotions are left unchecked. But as day turns to night, and in a desert that buries all secrets, it becomes apparent that this is no random journey down the highway. 3</plot><plot>A white man stranded on the side of the road.
