<plot>When word is leaked that Derek, a street thug working in a large drug ring, is actually an undercover officer, his partner in crime, Tony, is ordered to kill him. However, although he realizes most of their relationship has been a lie, Tony struggles with the idea of killing Derek, who he's become close friends with. Things get complicated when he discovers that the feelings aren't mutual and that Derek doesn't consider him a friend, but merely an easy source for information. Now Tony has to make a choice: he can either let Derek live and lose credibility within his gang or kill him and live with a guilty conscience. Luckily for Tony, simplicity can always be found in complication.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?497726</url></doc>
