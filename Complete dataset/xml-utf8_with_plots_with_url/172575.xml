<plot>A reflection, made through a familiar drama, about Nazism and its extermination camps. We try to analyze the most contemporaneous aspects of Nazism: its economical capitalist system based on competition. A grandmother that was killed after being a slave in a Siemens factory located in a concentration camp. A father that was fired from the company where he worked for so many years; and, finally, his son, forced to abandon home, leaving his father alone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?172575</url></doc>
