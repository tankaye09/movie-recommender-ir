<plot>On the gruesome battlefield of the civil war, a young confederate soldier attempts to redeem his past. Through a series of flashbacks, Stanley, the young confederate, must choose between what his father believes and his own beliefs. As the battle ensues, Stanley hears his superior, Colonel Dax, scream out "just one more hill, boys!!". Stanley is quickly reminded of his friend, Charlie, a slave on his father's farm. In the days before Stanley leaves for war, Charlie confesses to him that he is running for freedom and for Stanley to turn the other cheek. But Stanley is forced to adhere to his father's demands. With an ensuing chase at gunpoint, Charlie pleads "just one more hill, just let me die free", but Stanley kills his friend. Haunted by his past, Stanley eventually finds redemption by killing his racist superior, Colonel Dax, moments before his own death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569594</url></doc>
