<plot>Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of our past? Has technology served to bring us closer together, or to isolate us into ipod wearing zombies? In the short film Catalog, scans from a 1976 clothing catalog are juxtaposed with online dating websites and found images of musically isolated, ipod wearing single people. The thrust of this short film? If experience has taught us anything, convenience and technology often yields mixed results. Not everything that looks good on paper arrives looking as advertised, and online dating has changed the way we socialize forever. Now "putting yourself out there" involves sitting at home in front of a glowing computer monitor. We are all part of one vast, Facebooked, Catalog.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096591</url></doc>
