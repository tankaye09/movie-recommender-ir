<plot>Bruce is a happening guy of the 1970's. He begins by showing us his waterbed, which he first started appreciating after being laid up with injuries from his motorcycle mania. He then starts in about his shopping habits and his various collections. Occasionally intercut with scenes from his childhood, we end up in his bathroom, salivating over the poster girl for a spark plug company.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084637</url></doc>
