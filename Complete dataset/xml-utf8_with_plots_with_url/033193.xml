<plot>Monkey wakes up as he has every other morning, although this morning is not like every other morning. Snow blankets the landscape, something monkey has never seen before. He has never known his mouth to be on fire before either, but smoke now comes out with every breath so it must be on fire. He rushes to the river to douse his mouth with water but the frozen surface doesn't offer the relief he had hoped for... he proceeds to get his lips stuck to the ice and, after, finally breaking through, he turns into a monkey popsicle. This is the first of the four season to play tricks on poor monkey, just shows what happens when you wake up on the wrong side of the tree!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033193</url></doc>
