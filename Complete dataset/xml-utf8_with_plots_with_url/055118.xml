<plot>At the beginning of WWII, Virginia is sent to America by her parents to keep her safe. Now the war in Europe is over, it's time for Virginia (or Rusty, as she likes to be called) to come home. While she is glad to see her mother Peggy and tries to fit into her old life, her 'American ways' don't go down too well at home. When her father returns from war, he is desperate to have his life just the same as it was before, but he is forced to realise that his wife and his children are not the same people he left behind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?055118</url></doc>
