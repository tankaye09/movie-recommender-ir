<plot>After World War-2, little was left of Japan's cities and industries. The nation had very little in natural resources, having to import most of its raw materials, and even food. Yet they rebuilt, developing a thriving industrial and social society so rapidly that they were unable to control problems such as pollution. Eventually this economic "bubble" burst, and it took several years to recover ... mostly by becoming experts in the new "Age of Information Technology". Through all this, they have managed to keep much of their ancient cultural traditions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273965</url></doc>
