The rich businessman Vedat saves her from committing suicide and they get married. After a few years Reyhan tells Vedat about her past. Vedat investigates the matter and finds her daughter Cagla's tracks and brings her home. Rayhan is very happy. Years pass and Cagla becomes a young woman. She dates Cem, but neither Reyhan nor Vedat likes him. They understand that Cem is interested only Cagla's potential inheritance. Upon a fight with Cagla, Vedat dies and Reyhan takes over the business. Cem and Cagla secretly get married. When Reyhan stops supporting them, Cem starts treating Cagla badly and abusing her. Reyhan saves her daughter by killing him.
