<plot>ANOTHER LOST ANGEL is a feature-length documentary about the poetic life and violent death of Kat Perkoff: writer, runaway, drug smuggler, bar owner, local icon ... and my older sister. Comprised of archival footage, interviews, and "dreamlike recollections", this film began as a personal journey of sibling loss and quickly grew into a full-scale investigation of a life lived on the margins. ANOTHER LOST ANGEL explores notions of fate, identity, and memory as well as the seedy world of the New Orleans lesbian mafia subculture of the 1970's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042056</url></doc>
