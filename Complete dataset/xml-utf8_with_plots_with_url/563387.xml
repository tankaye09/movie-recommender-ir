<plot>"The Hanna-Barbera Happy Hour" was certainly a different kind of variety show. It was hosted by two life-size puppets, Honey and Sis (voiced by Udana Powers and Wendy McKenzie, respectively), who were "animated" from behind by a group of puppeteers (and "chroma-keyed" out of the picture), sang, and also participated in such comedy sketches as "The Disco of Life," "The Truth Tub," and "Name That Honey Hit." There were also parodies of currently popular TV shows (e.g. "Lavine and Shrilly," "The Ka-Bong Show"), and such costumed Hanna-Barbera characters as Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and Snagglepuss (voiced by Daws Butler) made cameo appearances. Tony Randall, Dan Haggerty, Melissa Gilbert, Twiggy, and Linda Lavin were among those who guest-starred on "The Hanna-Barbera Happy Hour" (and, for some strange reason, the stars introduced themselves, rather than by an announcer). Sadly, "The Hanna-Barbera Happy Hour" lasted only four weeks in the spring of 1978, but considering how awful the entertainment would become later that year, "Hanna-Barbera" would definitely have been a much-welcome and entertaining breath of fresh air!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?563387</url></doc>
