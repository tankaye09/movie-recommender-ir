<plot>Here we show the great and only "Fatima" the world's most wonderful Couchee Dancer. This mode of dancing is extremely popular in the eastern countries, and requires much practice and great skill to control and move the muscles of the body at will. This picture shows her in all her glory. We have this film in three different lengths, 50 feet, 75 feet and 100 feet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?190958</url></doc>
