<plot>Three parts to explore the meaning of life. Start here and end there, but decide if you are really tied. Part one: the nature of God. Part two: the existence of humans. Part three: the arrival. Upon arrival we reach a monstrous understanding and a point from which we can just make out the answers hovering in the distance. What if anything are we waiting for and do we really need Godot. Two souls debate the question and eventually take their first steps into the world, knowing that is the only way to progress. Something's happening alright, but Godot is, tragically, not included. Met with little more than kind indifference, he shuffles away into the unknown. Our protagonists choose instead to seek out a matching pair of ice cream cones.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261155</url></doc>
