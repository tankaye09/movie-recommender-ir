<plot>MONEY MAN is a documentary film about an artist, J. S. G. Boggs, who draws money. Boggs draws his "notes" (as he calls them) with the same face as regular U.S. currency with his thumbprint on the back, though with a unique device of some sort (such as a different picture or three, and his own signature). He goes around trying to sell his notes to people in exchange for services/goods/whatever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?375480</url></doc>
