<plot>Time to Listen tells the story of the renowned artist and psychiatrist Robert Rynearson, who is one of a dying breed of doctors who utilize creative art therapy techniques to help patients solve problems and settle inner conflicts. His incredible work as a doctor is only a small part of Bob's fascinating career as a sculptor, and the film aims to tell his story, from his conflicted childhood, his development of art therapy techniques, his experience as Ernest Hemingway's psychiatrist, and finally to his retirement and legacy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608634</url></doc>
