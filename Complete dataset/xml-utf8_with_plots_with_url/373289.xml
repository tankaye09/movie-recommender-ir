<plot>Before there was Dancing with the Stars, there was Mitzi Gaynor-television's original star dancer! From 1968 to 1978, Gaynor dazzled audiences with her annual, award-winning, network TV variety spectaculars - averaging over 30 million viewers each - showcasing the singing, dancing and comedic talents that made her a star in the theatre, film, television, nightclub and concert worlds. In honor of the 40th anniversary of Gaynor's first televised special (Mitzi, NBC, 1968) and the 50th anniversary of her signature, Golden Globe-nominated performance in the blockbuster 1958 film Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's South Pacific.  The ultimate collection of song and dance performances from Gaynor's classic network television specials - unseen for three decades - MITZI GAYNOR: RAZZLE DAZZLE! THE SPECIAL YEARS is a new documentary that celebrates a landmark career through new interviews with Mitzi and many others that worked with her. A reflective and entertaining glimpse into the television variety show at its zenith, taking viewers on a nostalgic trip through Gaynor's TV years: the groundbreaking performances, glitzy costumes and Mitzi's triple threat talent as illustrated in digitally remastered clips, rare photos and footage from Gaynor's personal archive, which illuminate the behind-the-scenes stories and impact of these 17-time Emmy®-nominated and 6-time Emmy®-winning TV milestones. Memorable moments with special guest stars. Among the classic performances featured in the documentary are numbers choreographed by some of the film and theatrical dance world's most influential choreographers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?373289</url></doc>
