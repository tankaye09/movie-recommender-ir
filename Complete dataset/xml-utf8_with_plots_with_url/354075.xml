<plot>Rob, is a struggling and frustrated artist/singer/songwriter who makes his living as a busker. Rob proves to be self-involved and self-indulgent as he creates a series of destructive events that in turn cause tragic consequences to the people and environment around him. The film presents a warning about the dangers and consequences of "apathy" and how it can affect the role of the artist. Rob, finally, finds redemption through his music and its power to communicate and to influence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354075</url></doc>
