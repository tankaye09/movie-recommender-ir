<plot>Two bad boys enter the kitchen. One climbs to the kitchen table and takes down the old lamp, the other goes to the flour barrel and scoops out some flour, pouring it into the chimney until it is filled to the top. The lamp is then replaced in the bracket. Grandma enters, scratches a match, removes the lamp chimney, when the flour falls upon her head. It sticks in her hair and fills her eyes, but this is where she turns the tables. Suspecting the bad boys, she grabs them by the heels, and throws them one after the other, head first into the flour barrel. Cannot fail to provoke mirth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221758</url></doc>
