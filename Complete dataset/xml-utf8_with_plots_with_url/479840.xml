<plot>Her reflection in the mirror stares back at her as Scarlet searches to find what her father saw on the day of her mother's funeral ans hasn't seen since. After that day he has become absorbed to the point of obsession with his work and spends all of his time in his basement morgue embalming the dead. Unable to capture his attention in any other way, Scarlet too becomes immersed in the world of the mortician as she watches her father work. The lines between life and death, father and daughter and love and lust blur, as she realizes that the only way she can be close to him again, loved by him again is to become his fascination - to become dead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479840</url></doc>
