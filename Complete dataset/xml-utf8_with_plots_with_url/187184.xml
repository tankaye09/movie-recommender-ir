<plot>Topical TV film from the VPRO series LOLAMOVIOLA. FACE tells the story of a young Croat who has worn a mask ever since his face was severely disfigured during the bloody civil war in former Yugoslavia. In Antwerp, the masked man desperately tries to collect money to have his battered face repaired. When he has collected the necessary capital with illegal work and shocking street acts, the end of the nightmare seems to be in sight. Then his cousin, the only person he trusts unconditionally, disappears with the money. Stunned and at the end of his tether, the duped man wanders the streets of Antwerp at night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187184</url></doc>
