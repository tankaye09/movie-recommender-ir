<plot>This is another bogus title emerging from the error-prone pages of Richard E. Braff's Silent Short Film Working Papers; it is not the same film as A Counterfeit Santa Claus (1912/I), which features a different cast, and there is no reliable documentation that the listed players, Bosworth, Cox, Daniels and Leighton, ever appeared together in a film bearing this title at this time. It is probable that the film was announced, but either never completed, or else completed but never released.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008922</url></doc>
