<plot>What happens when a ten-year-old boy suddenly learns he has just a few hours to live? When Ben comes down with the flu, his parents call their neighbour, a retired doctor to have a look. The Doc diagnoses a mild flu. However - Ben later hears his father and Doc, talking outside his window. Doc announces that "he probably won't make it through the day." Ben does not realize that Doc is talking about his aged Golden Retriever. Unbeknownst to his parents, Ben is resigned to the fact that he has just hours to live. The film is a poignant, funny description of those hours.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187588</url></doc>
