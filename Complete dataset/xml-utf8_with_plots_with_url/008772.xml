<plot>A very interesting film, giving views of the Treasury Department, the Corcoran Art Gallery, the War and Navy Building, the White House and other prominent points in the Nation's Capital. These views were taken by using the new circular panoramic attachment which has lately been added to our cameras, and we are thus enabled to present views taken from different points all in one film without breaking the continuity of the view, as the buildings appear to pass slowly before the eyes of the spectator.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008772</url></doc>
