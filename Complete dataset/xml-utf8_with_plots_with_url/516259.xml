<plot>A raw and gritty inside look at the epidemic of auto theft as told in the words of drug-addicted car thieves and the victims left in their wake. The tragic story of the life that was stolen from a beautiful young mother of two is woven between original and graphic police bait car and arrest footage in this first-of-its-kind documentary. The new phenomenon of the addiction of car theft and the devastating consequences that result are profiled in this fast paced and graphic 34 minute film. Viewers will never look at the issue of auto theft the same way. It is not just about stolen cars, it's about stolen lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516259</url></doc>
