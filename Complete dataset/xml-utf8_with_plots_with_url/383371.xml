<plot>Tara Morice played Fran in "Strictly Ballroom", which wowed audiences in over 80 countries and became a classic. She was thrust into the whirlwind of celebrity. That was 15 years ago. Then came 9/11. On that night, Mildred Levine, a 75 year old, lip-synching great grandmother, living in a retirement village in Coconut Creek, had organized a screening of "Strictly Ballroom" for her monthly movie night. As the red curtain came down, her audience rose to their feet, as best they could, and cheered for the first time that terrible day.That night, Mildred wrote her first ever fan letter to Tara, and has never stopped. Inspired by tapes of Mildred's big variety show "Follies", Tara travels to Coconut Creek to meet her fan for the very first time. She begins to understand why Mildred is such a fan, and meets the exuberant cast of "Follies" in the lead up to the spectacular opening night. "My Biggest Fan" documents an unlikely friendship forged between two women from very different worlds, and re-affirms the power of a movie to bring people together.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383371</url></doc>
