<plot>A mockumentary that immerses you into the campy world of the grind house film era with dozens of sexy, strange and humorous clips taken from rare trailers and outrageous feature films. Faux expert testimony from more than a dozen "professors" and those who supposedly contributed to that era, is the hilarious glue that fuses it all together and connects the past with the present. Grind house refers to the operations of a 24 hour theater that grinds out films around the clock. The term grind comes from the cranking sound that the old projectors made. Others say it refers to the early grind house films that showed girls stripping and grinding in back street 1930's burlesque theaters. The grindhouse films were hyped as the scourge to decency, attracting sexually oppressed and frustrated urbanites to seedy theaters that featured these movies all night long. These films thumbed their nose at the morality of Puritan ethics that millions abides by but secretly hated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178379</url></doc>
