<plot>A. THE DINNER. In this scene two gay couples are enjoying a wine dinner in the private room of a Bohemian Cafe. There is a great deal of hilarity and some love-making. A game of cards is suggested and the four go into an adjoining room. B. THE GAME. Here the four sit down for a game of poker. Chips are forthcoming and money is produced. The waiter takes advantage of the condition of the guests, drugs their wine and when they have all collapsed into an insensible condition, robs the men and flies. Excellent in photography and arrangement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125921</url></doc>
