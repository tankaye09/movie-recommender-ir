<plot>Chuck and Lauren Wilson are having marriage problems and seek help from Dr. Cher Montgomery, a ditsy young marriage councilor. As they finish marriage counseling, they fake their progress to leave. Neither of them change their ways; Lauren continues to be an incredibly vain Real estate agent, while Chuck stays stuck in the 80s. Their vanity and insecurities continue to add tension to their relationship. When they get home after their last session, they start nit-picking again. They blame each other for ridiculous things and intentionally annoy one another. They don't realize the small things they blame each for is neither of their faults, in the wrong kind of way another person comes to the surface that may save their struggling marriage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092748</url></doc>
