<plot>Another in a long (long, long) line of Will Cowans' and Universal's "Name Band Musicals" and "Musical Featurettes" that were a cross between Vaudeville and MTV, and mainly ensured audience turn-over between features. In addition to Frank DeVol's orchestra and singer Jaye P. Morgan this one also trotted out acts such as The Amazin' Frakson, Paul and Paulette and The Dream Makers. Music included "Stompin' at the Savoy" and "You Do Something To Me." In addition to selling a few records in the 50's, Jaye P. Morgan went on to be a regular guest on late-night talk shows and was not hesitant to share her opinions and be outspoken on many subjects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202305</url></doc>
