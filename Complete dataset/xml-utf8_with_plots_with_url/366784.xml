<plot>Eric wakes up and in his anonymous home and already he begins to deviate from what are clearly long established routines. He enters his work-place, a hive of disengaged office dwellers who are toeing the company line. A series of exchanges with colleagues climax in a review of their place and importance in his life. He oscillates between reality and a series of dream snaps that reveal his growing resentment. The CEO, worried about what is taking place in his controlled environment, requests a meeting with Eric. Eric begins to make peace with the decision to downsize his life and moves from a state of agitation to a state of assuredness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366784</url></doc>
