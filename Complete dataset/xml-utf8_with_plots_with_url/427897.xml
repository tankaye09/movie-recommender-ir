<plot>The action is set in the lovely lake country, just North of Warsaw, where several artists and professionals own rustic retreats. The main character is an architect who realizes that the drive for profit, success and fame in an industrialized society cannot equal the joys of life at the Waldon Pond. The striking scenes are those dealing with the everyday life of a fisherman, the dropout's new committment to life, and the dignity of leisure. His contacts with people lead in the end to a simple, philosophical statement on life, and its demand for human fulfillment. Then his wife, a professional singer, arrives for a visit. And there is brush with the death when a stranger knocks on the door to spend the night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427897</url></doc>
