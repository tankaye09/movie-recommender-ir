<plot>Macbeth: act ii, scene 1, line 33, Macbeth's third soliloquy: "Is this a dagger...". This scene preludes to the king Duncan's killing, act wickedly necessary to make Macbeth king and realize the witches' prophecy. Is this, probably, the only scene of the whole drama in which, if he had the power, Macbeth could save himself from his four hundred years old tragic destiny. The doubts that he always plays in this scene could win and convince him to not kill the king in spite of the evil push to kill that comes from Lady Macbeth. Is the choice time: to keep on playing the same role or to cut and run?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350074</url></doc>
