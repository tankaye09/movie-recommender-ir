<plot>September 17, 1937. In what the mounties are calling 'The Yukon River Incident', Scott 'Stubby' McPherson allegedly killed and ate all of his companions, during an ill-fated expedition of neophyte gold prospectors. Yes, it's the trial of the century! Star Federal Prosecutor Frederick Tiggle, backed by compelling evidence, promises to have a noose around Stubby's neck by the end of the week. Meanwhile Stubby's lawyer public defender Harry Armstrong is still looking to win his first case. During the trial we learn the truth of The Yukon River Incident, through a series of photos and flashbacks. The trial has its fair share of spectacle: the hapless McPherson defends himself on the stand, a fight breaks out in the courtroom, the prosecution ambushes the defence with a surprise star witness. It's enough to cause the fainting of more than a few courtroom spectators. As the evidence mounts, only a shocking turn of events can save Stubby from the hangman's noose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596990</url></doc>
