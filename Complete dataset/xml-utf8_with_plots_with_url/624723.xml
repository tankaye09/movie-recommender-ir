<plot>Hosted by Wink Yahoo (Scott Yaphe), this game show involves children teams of 2. One spins the wheel and the other one stands ready to begin a task. If the wheel lands on Mayhem, the second child goes over to Smashin' Sam and Tearin' Aaron to complete a task (usually messy) for a maximum 50 points. The other parts of the wheel have things like quiz rounds, point reversals and something called "Uh Oh." When the wheel lands on Uh Oh, the second child is locked in a small room until the first can answer a multiple-choice question. If they get the question wrong, the Punisher splashes the second child with goo. After all 3 teams have taken turns spinning the wheel, the show moves on to the Slime Tour round. This section is hosted by Shawn Majumder and is usually found somewhere across Canada. It is an obstacle course. The teams in the studio must vote for who they think will win the race, for a bonus of 20 points. Part 3 of the show is the same as Part 1, except the kids change!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?624723</url></doc>
