<plot>Only two hours from Manhattan, off the coast of Long Island, you will find a remote barrier beach known as Fire Island. Made up of thirty two miles of beautiful white sand beaches with eighteen towns, two state parks and miles of National Seashore, Fire Island is an amazing experience where families, groupers, and singles can find a quiet, relaxing get-away and a thriving party scene all in the same great location. Explore this remote island where cars are replaced by wagons, nearly everyone arrives by boat, and all different kinds of people coexist and inhabit one of the best beaches in the world. Meet the interesting characters, the wild life and the beautiful landscape that creates "The Many Faces of Fire Island."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575180</url></doc>
