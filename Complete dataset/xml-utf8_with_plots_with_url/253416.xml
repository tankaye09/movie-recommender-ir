<plot>Sean is a recently divorced, depressive middle aged man. One night, his daughter is taken by a mysterious stranger and held captive. The next day he receives an envelope with one of his daughter's fingers inside and a letter that states if he does not kill himself by midnight, he will receive the rest of his daughter in various pieces. Now Sean must find this maniac with the help of the FBI and his ex-wife before time runs out, or make the most disturbing choice of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253416</url></doc>
