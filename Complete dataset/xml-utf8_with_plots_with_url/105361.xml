<plot>When two men living in an isolated cabin run out of food they develop two very different strategies. After Bones loses an ear under suspicious circumstances, Chubby is faced with a dilemma. While Bones leaves to search for food the ear is left unattended in the freezer. On the one hand that ear would really hit the spot, but on the other hand he has been asked specifically not to eat it. After inventing a creative solution to the problem, Chubby is finally free to dabble in some light cannibalism. Unfortunately the ear does not leave him satisfied for long. He is hungry for more. All alone in the cabin his options are limited. Unable to ignore his cravings he paces around desperately, before arriving at a revelation: Bones isn't the only human around with ears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?105361</url></doc>
