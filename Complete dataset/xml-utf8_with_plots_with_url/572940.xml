<plot>Ralph and Brenda are happily in love - until the night they are attacked by zombies. As a zombie, Ralph forgets his human life and encounters a new perspective; humans are actually the cursed menace, zipping around shooting innocent zombies. In order to survive, the zombies must band together and eat brains, something Ralph is very good at. However his life is thrown into disarray when he meets zombie Brenda. Ralph finds it difficult to concentrate on brains as he falls in love, a concept unknown in zombie society. In the end Ralph must choose between his lust for brains and his love for Brenda.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572940</url></doc>
