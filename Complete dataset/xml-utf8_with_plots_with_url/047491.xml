<plot>The Mt. Low Cable Incline and Electric Railroad Company is the owner of a railroad which represents wonderful features of engineering skill. We have made pictures during the entire trip over this wonderful road from the foot to the summit of Mt. Low, the top of which is some 12,000 feet above sea level. This beautiful picture was taken from the front of the great cable incline car, which makes an ascent of 1,500 feet in a distance of 1,200 yards, and the ride up in the cable incline car is most thrilling. The passengers are carried about one-third the distance in a cable car when they are changed to the electric line which takes them to the summit. Sold complete or in spearate lengths.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047491</url></doc>
