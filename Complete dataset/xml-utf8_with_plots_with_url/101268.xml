<plot>A father makes a surprise visit to Los Angeles to drop in on his four 40 something "Baby Boomer" aged sons. It is immediately apparent that Dad is less-than-welcome as he is quickly bounced from household to household. His four alienated and highly dysfunctional sons play a game of human "hot potato" with Dad as they humorously shirk the responsibility of spending time with dad, dealing with his eccentricities - and re-visiting the many skeletons in this family's closet. A dark family secret lies at the bottom of all this turmoil.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101268</url></doc>
