<plot>The acclaimed author of "Fire in the Belly" presents an exhilarating look at the flying trapeze and at the potential it offers for growth and transformation. In "Learning to Fly", Keen traces the life journey that led him to respond to the lure of the trapeze and shares what his five years of intensive practice have taught him about living more intensely and passionately. "Learning to Fly" teaches us to soar on the wings of possibility. As we watch Sam Keen and fellow students progress through breathtaking exercises, Keen imparts moving revelations about risk-taking, trust, bravado, true strength, falling and letting go. "Learning to Fly" reveals the grace of ascending in body and spirit- and living with levity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327833</url></doc>
