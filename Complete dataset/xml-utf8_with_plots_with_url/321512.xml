<plot>King Ram is distressed to learn that His male subjects consider Him to have been in error when He accepted the return of His wife, Sita, after Her enforced absence with Ravan. Despite his belief in Her chasteness, the King sees it as His duty to bow to democratic will. He orders His brother, Laxman, to abandon Sita in the forest and he bolts the doors of his chambers and His heart to His wife. Cast into perdition, Sita is prevented from suicide by the sage, Gurudev, who takes Her in and gives Her shelter. She gives birth to twins, Lav and Kush. Under the tutelage of the Sage, the boys become masters at arms. Using magical powers, they rout an army seeking to establish the King's rule over the Hermitage where the boys live. Laxman is wounded in the battle. The King, Himself, enters the fray seeking revenge. In the nick of time, father, mother and sons, and the King and His subjects are reconciled and Sita returns to the bosom of Mother Earth from which She came.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321512</url></doc>
