<plot>Widowed Havaldar Pandupatti would like to get his only child, a daughter named Madhuri, happily married, preferably to a Police Inspector. But Madhuri has eyes only for Bollywood super-stars like Sanjay Dutt, Shahrukh Khan, and Govinda, and all she wants is to be an actress so that she can be near any or all of them. She will not even consider marrying anyone else. She does change her mind when a Govinda look-alike Police Inspector comes to take charge, whose name is Gaurishankar. Both of them are attracted to each other and would like to marry as soon as possible. But an increase in criminal activities compels Gaurishankar to postpone his marriage and focus on apprehending criminals, who are all set to replace the State's Chief Minister with a look-alike, after abducting the real one. Watch how Gaurishankar is joined by Raju and Farooq Khan (look-alike of Sanjay Dutt and Shahrukh Khan respectively) and together they attempt to rid the evil before it takes root.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249840</url></doc>
