<plot>A man is trying to get sleep, but is kept awake by the enormously irritating buzz of a mosquito. When he opens his eyes, the buzz stops. When he closes his eyes, the zooming starts again. When he tries to find the insect by putting on a light, the mosquito stops moving. With the lamp out, the buzz starts again. Finally the man has a great idea. He will fool the mosquito by closing his eyes and holding up his hand to hit it when it comes near. But the mosquito doesn't fall for it. As soon as the man lowers his hand, the creature starts buzzing again. What is this way too intelligent kind of mosquito? Is it a mutation or is there something else going on?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378004</url></doc>
