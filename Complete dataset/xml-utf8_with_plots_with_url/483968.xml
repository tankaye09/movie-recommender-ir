<plot>Secrets of the Reef is a feature-length documentary about life and death on a Pacific coral reef as seen from the perspective of three reef inhabitants: a sea turtle, a hermit crab and a reef fish. The sea turtle is searching for a mate, the hermit crab for a new shell, and the fish for a meal. Each faces numerous obstacles in its quest and at the same time, the entire reef community is threatened by an unseen threat that is getting closer every day. Secrets of the Reef was filmed entirely on location in high definition by Emmy Award-winning cinematographer Jonathan Bird. This epic tale of survival will enthrall viewers of all ages.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483968</url></doc>
