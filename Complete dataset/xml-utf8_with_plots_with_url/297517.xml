<plot>After being bullied by a nasty boy, a little girl decides to play a prank on him by building a rocket ship (actually a wooden rocket ship on a wagon) and allows him to get inside, riding him down to the deserted countryside where a cow was walking around. Believing that he is actually on the moon, he is frightened by his stark surroundings, and believes the cow to be a space monster. He also meets a small, bizarre-looking space monster (which actually turns out to be the little girl wearing over-sized gear)!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?297517</url></doc>
