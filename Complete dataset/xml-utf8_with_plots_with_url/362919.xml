<plot>Eleven year old Seema has issues with her skin colour. Surrounded by the white kids of her Canadian community, and inundated by her masi's (aunts) opinion that fair skin is better, Seema resorts to drastic measures in order to bleach her skin. Seema mistakenly believes that using Mr. Clean on her skin will lead to a fairer, more beautiful colour. When Seema ends up in the hospital, she comes to realize that skin isn't what defines the person - it's what is beneath the skin that counts. Me, Masi &amp; Mr. Clean is a short, bittersweet comedy about accepting the things you cannot change, and focusing on the things that can make a difference.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362919</url></doc>
