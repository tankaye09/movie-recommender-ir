<plot>As the nation prepares for war, the U.S. Public Health Service reminds people that the strength of the armed services depends on the health of the people, which depends on good teeth. At a Selective Service office, volunteers receive a physical exam. Bad teeth is the largest cause for failing the physical. With bad teeth, a person might be turned down by the army, business, and romance. Almost everyone has decayed teeth, says the narrator, so a regular visit to the dentist is a requirement.
