<plot>Futuristic role-playing game unofficially based upon Game Designer Workshop's "Traveler" pen and paper game. Players build their character by enlisting in one of the military services -- Navy, Army, Scouts, Merchant Marines, or Other Services -- and receive training in a number of skills that will help in later life. After each round of four-year service, your character may leave the military to embark on one of six scenarios: Defend, in which as an administrator for a far-flung planet, you must defend it from an alien invasion; High Finance, in which can dabble in the galactic stock market; Explore, in which you mine planets for their riches; Trader; in which you earn money by transporting passengers and cargo on your spaceship; and First Blood; in which you pit your dexterity, cunning and weapons against an adversary in a death match to collect all his possessions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?508891</url></doc>
