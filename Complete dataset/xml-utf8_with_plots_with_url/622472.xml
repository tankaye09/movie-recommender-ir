Joe wants Anthony to achieve the success in the ring that he was denied as a young man. When Anthony meets Kate, he begins to see his life - and the role violence - in a different light. He loses focus on boxing and, in a confrontation with his father, learns about Joe's painful past. Joe turns his back on his son. Anthony leaves the ring spending time with Kate in their blossoming romance. He earns his living as a nightclub bouncer . When Anthony becomes involved in a street fight at a public event Kate dumps him. Anthony reflects on who he is and all that he has recently lost. Tom, Kate's comedian brother helps Anthony see the world and his life from a different perspective Joe is betrayed by Nico another boxer of Sicilian decent.
