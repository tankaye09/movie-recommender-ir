<plot>When eleven-year-old Harry gets suspended from school, his mother, Cecilia, has no choice but to revisit her past. Working three jobs just to keep her son at a private school, Cecilia can find no one to keep an eye on Harry for the next few days. After more than ten years of distance, Cecilia swallows her pride and asks her father for help. Harry is suddenly thrown into a world he doesn't know, with a man he has never met. Cousin Charlie had told Harry tales about Grampa, but didn't believe him till he walked up to Grampa's front porch. Now completely scared and alone in a strangers care, Harry finds himself in trouble once again as he discovers the forbidden attic. Inside this dark and dreary room, Harry finds a story waiting to be told, inside something he thinks has no real value. A simple little penny takes them on a journey inside the lives that have been touched by this special coin. We go through a family's struggle to get out of the "family" when the mafia was king; we follow a woman married to a soldier who strives to keep hope alive during WWII; we see an African-American boy and his mother working hard to find goodness in the midst of all the hate, while a homeless little girl looks for a prayer to be answered; we dive into a love story of a young couple from opposite sides of the tracks who's love carries them through their family's hardships. As Grampa tells the penny's tales, we see the coin working its own magic creating a special bond between the two. Harry unexpectedly learns about life and himself, and in the end, the penny manifests the love and spirit that was once alive in this separated family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?581949</url></doc>
