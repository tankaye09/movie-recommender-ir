<plot>Nowhere on earth do meter readers run into more bizarre situations than in Los Angeles, so for Frank Adams this day started out like any other. Beautiful bikini-clad girls and vicious dogs are par for the course on his route, but before this day was over, Frank was to find himself in a predicament that no other meter reader had ever encountered. A premonition in a dream, a musty old cellar, the labored breathing of a maniac all would be part of the most frightening day Frank had ever known a day that could cost him his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097900</url></doc>
