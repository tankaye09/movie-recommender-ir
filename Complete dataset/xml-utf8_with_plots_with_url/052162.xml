<plot>Jason (Jeremy Greenwell) is an assistant campaign manager for a conservative city councilman. Katie (Elizabeth Goffena) is a college dropout working as a waitress. She doesn't know where she's going with her life; he doesn't know what he's doing with her. They both have a few things to learn. Matt and Deb (Matt Mulcahey and Sarah Schulte) are friends. They were lovers, several years ago; now they share an apartment. Deb's an actress with an eye on Brad (Anthony Marquez), the star of her play. Matt does nothing - even though his parents just cut him off. Their constant bickering masks a good friendship, a friendship threatened by Matt's jealousy over Deb's relationship with Brad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052162</url></doc>
