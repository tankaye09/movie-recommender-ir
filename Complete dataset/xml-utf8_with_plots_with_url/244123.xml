<plot>It's the suburbs of "Ozzie and Harriet" and of "Leave It To Beaver." A frazzled Paul comes home from work to his doting wife, Kathy. She fills his pipe with hashish to help him relax. At dinner, Paul and Kathy, their two children, and a friend of the kids sit companionably around the table smoking pot to mellow out. Later, as they watch TV, a hookah is at hand. Paul gets a great idea for the cola ad campaign he's been working on at the office. Kathy encourages him. On the next night, he comes home with a report on how it went.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?244123</url></doc>
