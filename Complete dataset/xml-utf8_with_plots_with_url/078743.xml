<plot>An exploration of the relationship between two teenage boys while they videotape an unknowing female, engage in mental masturbation, and talk about what they would like to do to her. Or maybe, what they really would like to do to each other. They talk and talk and talk until their words become meaningless and incoherent. These boys are repulsive human beings. They are also a dime a dozen at any college campus. This is reality...deal with it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078743</url></doc>
