<plot>One contestant and one celebrity partner played against another contestant and another celebrity partner in a game of puns. Play began with the host randomly selecting one of 100 computer (punch)cards from a spinning wheel and placed into an electronic scanning machine. Each card had one player (who would try to solve a puzzle) and one point value (between 300-1000) programmed into it, and the player selected by the machine would select one of six clues about a person, place, or thing. If the player guessed correctly, the points were added to the player's "bank", otherwise another card would be selected and play would continue until the puzzle was solved. A "Blankety Blank" was a pun with the punchline removed, such as: The tornado that hit the pretzel factory was a real ____. (Answer: Twister) If the contestant and celebrity partner answered correctly, all the points in their bank would become dollars for the contestant and the opponents would get a Strike. A contestant that lost three Blankety Blanks (Strikes) would leave the show with any money accumulated, and a new contestant would play. There was no end game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074254</url></doc>
