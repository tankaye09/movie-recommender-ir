<plot>"Johnny Mann's Stand Up and Cheer" was an energetic, feel-good half hour of singing, dancing, and occasional comedy. Despite the title's implications, "Stand Up and Cheer" wasn't all patriotic music; it was, however, mostly adult contemporary standards - and even show tunes - but no rock and roll. Among those who guest-starred on "Stand Up and Cheer" were Jim Backus (singing "You Gotta Have Heart," Mr. Magoo-style, with the regulars), Bob Crane (who also played the drums), Milton Berle, Ken Berry (who sang with the regulars and did a tap number), and even Lassie (the regulars sang "I Wish I Had a Puppy" around her while she was on stage)! Each show ended with Mann saying, "Always remember....," after which the chorus sang, "Keep your eye on the grand old flag!" as a giant American flag appeared behind them. A terrific variety show that could be enjoyed by the entire family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513144</url></doc>
