<plot>On 26/11/2008, a group of young terrorists attacked 5 star hotels and tourist spots in Mumbai, India, unleashing terror of a new kind. For 4 days, the city of Mumbai was on tenterhooks as the state battled to snuff out the agents of terror from their hiding places. And finally when it ended, what emerged was a wanton trail of death and destruction. Some survived the terror attacks, miraculously. And then, there were hundreds who perished, perhaps caught in the butterfly effect of negative thought and negative action. But some of the biggest victims of the attack were not necessarily those were caught in the crossfire...but families and friends who suffered trauma and the pain of losing their loved ones. But like always, there was a silver lining. Thousands of people lined up to offer help..monetary and otherwise..to support those who had suffered. As the dust began to settle, hundreds of human stories began to emerge. Stories of the reckless cruelty..and suffering..along with stirring human stories of courage, kindness and hope. Apollo Bunder is a compilation of 6 short films, each of which capture the effect of this cataclysm on various people, through the use of distinct 'morning after' and 'day before' scenarios.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?043559</url></doc>
