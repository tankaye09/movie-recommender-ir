<plot>Supertalk is a short film that confronts society's obsession with self-help and psychobabble and turns it on its head. Utilizing the character of Dr. Flora, a right wing self-help radio show host, we are treated to her version of 'tough love' as she lays waste to psyches like Godzilla does to Tokyo. The catch? All of the people calling in are superheroes, and with Dr. Flora's blithely ignorant counseling, they are almost all undone. Robin leaves Batman, Spiderman is reduced to tears and Superman's secret identity is revealed to millions of people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522856</url></doc>
