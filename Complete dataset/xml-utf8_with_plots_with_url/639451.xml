<plot>This is the story of a law-abiding young man, Vikram who is studying law to protect the rights of innocents. After attaining his credentials as a lawyer, he is aghast at the way the courts release criminals, mostly due to lack of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses. He, therefore, gives up his profession and calls himself Vicky Dada, the avenger of the poor and the helpless. As his career is null and void without any future, he foregoes his love with Shyamlee, and starts to love Savitri. Shyamlee is devastated at this, and vows to find out the reason behind the change in Vikram's behaviour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?639451</url></doc>
