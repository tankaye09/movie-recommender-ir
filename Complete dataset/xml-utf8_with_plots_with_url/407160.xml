<plot>A young woman, who is full of internal contradictions, and a maverick. Until her seventeenth birthday she always wanted to become a nun but things turned out differently. What were her reasons to radically change her life and which questions is she asking herself today? Through her personal stories we discover her singular life-path. Slowly the film sketches the pursuit of liberty of a longing feminist in the present catholic Poland.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407160</url></doc>
