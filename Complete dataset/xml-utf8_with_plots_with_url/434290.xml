<plot>Two guys sit in their Hollywood apartment discussing ordering a pizza. One wants sausage, one wants pepperoni. They flip a coin, which rolls out the door, down the stair, and through the streets. The men give chase. After they lose the coin when it falls through a grate, they settle for tacos; but when the coin suddenly rolls past, they run after it. It finally comes to rest deep in Griffith Park, with the sun beating down. What will it be?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434290</url></doc>
