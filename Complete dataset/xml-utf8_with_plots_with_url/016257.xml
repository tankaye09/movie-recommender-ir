<plot>A Soldiers Song is a drama which centres on a young army reservist Tony Doyle, played by Gary Lydon, embarking on Annual Military Camp. Doyle, as well as trying to come to terms with the painful memories of his boyhood, must also face the brutal realities of his present-day army life. As he bears witness to more and more acts of victimization inflicted on weaker colleagues by the barracks bully, he realises that he cannot change the past. Will he have the strength, however, to tackle the present and take responsibility for his future, as he struggles for control in the face of constant provocation?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?016257</url></doc>
