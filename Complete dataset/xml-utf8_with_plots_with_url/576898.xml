<plot>OCEAN (a struggling cartoonist), RICK (an unskilled actor) and CHRIS (a celibate personal trainer) find in LA, it is hard to draw the line between work and pleasure. After being dropped by his longtime, actress girlfriend ZORA, Ocean shuns all relationships, becoming a serial dater until he falls for his newly appointed writing partner TROI. Rick dates an older casting agent in hopes of a job, and Chris can't seem to keep his hands off his client, the spiritual and gorgeous PASQUAL. The film presents a hilarious and touching real life look at three friends in LA. It's a hip comedy done in the style of "Swingers" and "The Player" with a diverse cast.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576898</url></doc>
