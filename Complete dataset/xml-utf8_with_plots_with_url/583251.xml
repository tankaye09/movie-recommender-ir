<plot>John Hogan ran for the second congressional district for Missouri in August of 2006. Some would call John Hogan a politician, some would call him a man seeking change in society, and some would call him a dirty old man. The Politician is about a man who enjoys politics, ties, American flag pins, and the female body. Did he really run for congress? Or did he run from an angry husbands after Fillibustering with his wife? Its up to the viewer to decide whether it is true or false in this spin on an everyday old man's life of politics and big breasted females.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583251</url></doc>
