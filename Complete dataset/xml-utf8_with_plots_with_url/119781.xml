<plot>"Here is one of our crack cruisers which gave a good account of herself in the late war. Before leaving League Island Navy Yard, Philadelphia, this monster marine fighter was crowded daily by young and old who had nothing but admiration for her beauty and fighting capabilities. Our films excel all other warships live motion pictures for many reasons. The principal one is that the sharp, jerky motion shown by other film manufacturers in their marine pictures has been overcome by us, and you can see in our films the vessels gliding majestically through the water, and you are led to believe that you are viewing a real ship in real water instead of her photograph. These war pictures cannot be excelled."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119781</url></doc>
