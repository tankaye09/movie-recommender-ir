<plot>On July 13, 1994, the small coastal central Florida town of Madera Verde, was christened in blood. Olivia and Victor Mendoza were caught up in the midst of a bitter litigation process. The high-profile case was about to turn over in their favor when they were brutally murdered on the night of the town's annual founders' day celebration. Their killer was never caught. Over a decade later, Olivia and Victor's now grown daughters, have finally been able to heal after losing both their parents in such a horrific manner. All is going well for the sisters. Katrina, the youngest of the two, is engaged to be married to her very supportive Marine boyfriend, Greg Sanders. The sisters's world comes crashing down around them, when an elusive assassin begins a reign of terror, sadistically offing those closest to them one by one. To make matters worse, Katrina's fianc√©e has gone missing and ends up becoming the prime suspect. As the hours count down to the anniversary of their parents' deaths, the sisters rally to unravel the twisted web of betrayal, before they too, end up dead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365316</url></doc>
