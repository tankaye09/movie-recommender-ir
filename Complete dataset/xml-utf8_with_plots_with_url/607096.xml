<plot>Tiara Girls documents the struggles of several ambitious young women in their journeys to win what they believe to be the most coveted sign of success- a beauty pageant crown. See what really happens behind-the-scenes and what it's really like to prepare for a beauty pageant as we follow them. Most of these young ladies have competed in many, many pageants. Whether they've won or lost, they've got the ambition to keep pushing on. From hiring talent coaches to practicing in their bedrooms late at night, these ladies have got the will, but they've also got some intense competition. Will these young women have what it takes to win their tiaras, or will they leave the stage in tears?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?607096</url></doc>
