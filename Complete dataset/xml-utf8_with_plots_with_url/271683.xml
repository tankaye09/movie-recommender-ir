<plot>Mahant Chaturvedi did not approve of his daughter marrying outside of their caste to Gopi, and as such breaks off all relations with them. Years later, Gopi attempts to make amends by bringing his grown-up daughter, Sandhya, an accomplished dancer, to her grandfather. After witnessing her dance, Mahant approves of her, blesses her, and wants her to marry his ward, Brahmananda Chaturvedi, alias Nandu, who he has adopted years ago. The problem is that Sandhya is in love with a lower-caste youth by the Hari. Nevertheless, she does marry Nandu, only to find out that he prefers to go elsewhere at night, leaving her alone with her thoughts and of her love for Hari.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271683</url></doc>
