<plot>A nurse enters a park, with her baby in a pram - but she is pre-occupied with her soldier boy-friend. Dusty Rhodes the tramp has a thirst, and starts to quench it from the baby's bottle. Seeing him, the soldier chases him round the park bench, and throws him down, unfortunately onto the pram, flattening it and the baby in the process. Dusty makes off, pursued by the soldier, the nurse and flattened baby.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596741</url></doc>
