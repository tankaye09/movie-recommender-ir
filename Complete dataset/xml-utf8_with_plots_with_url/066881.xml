<plot>While wandering around a penny arcade, Bettina bumps into its quirky operator, James. He buys her a fortune and they plan a date later. At ballet rehearsal, Bettina unexpectedly has an epileptic seizure. Waking up in an ambulance, she then meets an unfriendly doctor at the hospital who gives her bad news. Bettina leaves the hospital and watches an old man practice Tai Chi in the park. In her state, the last thing she feels like doing is going on a first date, but she doesn't want to stand James up. Bettina does meet him at a caf√©, and the date goes awry. Sleep deprived and becoming increasingly nervous, she begins having little seizures. Spilling tea on herself, she leaves a bewildered James behind and the possibility of finding true love... unless that old fortune telling machine proves true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066881</url></doc>
