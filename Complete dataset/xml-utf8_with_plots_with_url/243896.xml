<plot>For a wounded American soldier returning home from Iraq, the conflict has just begun. "Home Front" captures the human story of what happens when Sergeant Jeremy Feldbusch returns to civilian life in his small hometown, as he readjusts to family, community --and most importantly, his new, altered self. On another level, the film is also about Jeremy's family, and how they cope with events that have forever changed them. By turns heartbreaking and inspiring, "Home Front" gets behind the often-sanitized myth of war to reveal its true complications and costs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243896</url></doc>
