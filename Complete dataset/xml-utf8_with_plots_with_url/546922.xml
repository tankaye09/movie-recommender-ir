<plot>This lightwight summer series (which apparently very few people remember) was a comeback of sorts for Dave Garroway. Over the last few years before this series aired, he had discovered most of the cast at various venues across the United States (e.g. nightclubs, dinner theaters). The series was supposed to be the launching pad for the regulars listed below, but very few went on to stardom and if they did they were in forgettable roles. Although this was primarily a musical show, there were also comedy sketches, with comedy troupe The Good Humor Company as regulars. This family-friendly show added the perfect touch to a warm summer's night back in 1971. Sadly, it hasn't been seen since it left the air on September 6 of that year. Maybe a good idea for a TV retrospective airing?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546922</url></doc>
