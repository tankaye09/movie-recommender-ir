<plot>The story has many twists and turns among its four main characters. Karen wants to leave her husband for "another woman". The other woman, Monica, is a former drug addict rescued from an almost certain death on the streets of Los Angeles. However their plan to be together becomes complicated when Karen learns that her husband is terminally ill with cancer. She feels obliged to stay with him until the bitter end. Meanwhile her husband, Ricky, asks Dr. Schreck for an assisted suicide (euthanasia) scheduled to occur on his birthday. After the husband's passing, life becomes idyllic for the two woman. Moreover, there is the promise of the imminent arrival of a large inheritance of 3 million dollars left by her husband. But the creepy Dr Schreck wont go away, and keeps appearing in the two women's lives. Schreck secretly drugs Monica in order to discredit her in Karen's eyes, which leads to a catastrophic ending of their relationship. Then on the day the inheritance money arrives, the characters converge one last time. Only one of them walks away... with the money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?484244</url></doc>
