<plot>Two rich capitalists want to marry their children, but they don't like the idea at all. She tries to run away, and meets him at the station. They fall in love, unbeknownst to their real identities, and decide each on their own that they have to wreck their parents plan. He asks his valet, to put a small postscript on his letter of introduction, stating that he's crazy and has sometimes (at least six times a day) crazy spells. To try this he uses an innocent victim, who promptly phones the insane asylum, that one of their patients is on the loose. At his future parents-in-law's home he acts crazy, till the moment he finds out, who the intended bride really is. Her completely shocked father asks the family doctor about how to behave with a lunatic and receives the advice to act crazy herself, follows it, and is promptly taken to the insane asylum.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118017</url></doc>
