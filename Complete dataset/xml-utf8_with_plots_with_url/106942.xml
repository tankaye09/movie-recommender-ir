<plot>On the Lehigh Valley Railroad. This place is described in books of travel as "The Switzerland of America." The scene begins with the camera looking down the hill toward the Mansion Hotel. The camera is slowly revolved from right to left, making an entire sweep of this most picturesque city nestled in the hills of the Pohohoka Mountains, with the Susquehanna River winding through their midst. The camera being on the side of the mountains, at an elevation of about 200 feet, furnishes a most excellent view of Mauch Chaunk and all the surrounding hills. This picture is absolutely perfect photographically and a most interesting subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106942</url></doc>
