<plot>Despite his self-invented wake-up system, which his knack for sabotage overcomes even in his sleep, Bean is very late for his dental appointment - so he changes from pj's while driving his car, and brushes his teeth while he's at it. In the surgery he absolutely wants the Batman comic a school boy is reading, so he eliminates the poor kid by wetting his trousers with vase water. His fiddling with the dentistry equipment results in rendering the dentist temporarily unconscious, so he does his own filling, then realizes he doesn't know whether he read the X-ray correct and ends up giving most of his teeth the treatment needed for only one. Next he goes to the park, offers to repair a kid's remote control boat but sets the frequency so it also operates an old lady's wheelchair; a car thief finds his steering wheel missing. Finally, his picnic turns into an unconventional duel with a wasp.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597178</url></doc>
