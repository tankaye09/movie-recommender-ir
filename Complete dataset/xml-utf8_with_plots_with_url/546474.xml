<plot>The Bug Man is about how an exterminator tries to connect with his clients and the consequences of these connections. Felix is a mild-mannered exterminator. At work, he moves from house to house, as invisible to his clients as the insects they pay him to spray. At home, Felix and his wife, Clarisse, dream of having a child to fill the silence of their evenings. Felix's most interesting client is a widowed beauty queen who spends her days alone in her large, dark house. When Felix suggests she go out with another one of his clients, a handsome, recently divorced attorney, he seems to have lifted her spirits. But when the relationship takes an unexpected turn, Felix is faced with a choice that could either ruin his career or make his dreams come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?546474</url></doc>
