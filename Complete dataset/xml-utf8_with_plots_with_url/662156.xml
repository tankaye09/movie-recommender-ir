<plot>The world stands on the brink of war. It's not a war with another country. It's not an alien invasion. It's a war with another of Earth's native species....Homo superior. MUTANTS The word strikes fear on those who hear it. It strikes fear into the hearts of those who are it. Mankind has made the first move, launching an army of giant robot executioners called sentinels, programmed to locate and eliminate the mutant DNA strand. Magneto and his terrorist cell of mutants are preparing to follow through on their threats of Homo sapiens genocide. The only force that can prevent total annihilation? Five akward teenagers and their crippled mentor. War is on the horizon, and the Tomorrow People are here. Pick a side.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?662156</url></doc>
