<plot>It the time span of a few months 4 students were put to the test of creating an 'A' quality documentary at the University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin. In their pursuit of a compelling subject they determined to follow ghost hunters on their excursions. In this quest the students found that the subject of ghost hunting is not as glamorous as demonstrated in Hollywood style films. Instead, there are a lot of technical devices to assist ghost hunters, a lot of sitting and waiting, and of course the most necessary ingredient of all, luck. Did the students get lucky enough while they followed the hunts? Only time will tell. See for yourself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214183</url></doc>
