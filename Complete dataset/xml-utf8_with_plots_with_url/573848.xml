<plot>In March, 2000, Glenn Hughes and a film crew of 30 people shot a video for "Days Of Avalon" off Glenn's CD "Return Of Crystal Karma". It was directed by Jim LaRocca of Riccochet Films. This video cassette not only features the promo clip for "Days Of Avalon", it also features an extensive behind the scenes look since there was a camera running constantly to capture all the action. The band in the stage shots of the promo clip consists of Glenn (bass, vocals), Hans Zermuehlen (keyboards), Mike Scott (guitar) and Matt Sorum (drums). A behind-the-scenes glimpse at the making of the video for the breath-taking new ballad from Glenn Hughes. This film provides the fans with a unique opportunity to witness the step-by-step development of Hughes' first full-blown concept video as a solo artist. Featuring 25 minutes of documentary footage which culminates with the video itself. "The Making Of Days Of Avalon" gives fans a rare opportunity to catch "The Voice" in the middle of the creative process, making this film an essential addition to any fan's collection.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573848</url></doc>
