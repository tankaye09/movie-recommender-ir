<plot>Apart from the sight of the earth and the moon in the sky at the same time, and the flaming rocks that fall at irregular intervals into the streets, it could be a slum anywhere on Old Earth... like the slums of Montevideo where Uncle Tio grew up. In fact, it is an abandoned mining colony in a giant crater of a large asteroid, precariously protected from vacuum. Just like the slums of Earth, the strong prey on the weak and the weak upon the weaker; and Tobi, who makes a meager living as a scrap collector and occasional bare-knuckle fighter, knows that the only chance of escape for himself and his friends lies in the monthly rocket from the Russian colony outside the crater. But the cost is more than he would usually make in a decade. Does the solution lie at the gaming tables of El Senor, who with his enforcers rules over the colony with an iron hand?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067173</url></doc>
