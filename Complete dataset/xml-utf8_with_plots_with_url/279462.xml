<plot>After sharing cookies with a group of children that have come to visit her, Lethe Tatge then shares her family history. She tells of her great grandfather, Jeremiah Robey, who was born in 1809 and would be baptised into the Mormon Church by Joseph Smith himself. Jeremiah worked on the Nauvoo Temple and knew Joseph quite well. Lethe tells how her great grandfather would share stories with chidren in the family, and how her brother Henry had asked if Joseph Smith was a man like other men. Jeremiah had answered that he was, and related how Joseph had held his hand while on horseback sharing thoughts about the church. Jeremiah held Lethe's hands and said that she had had her hand held in the hand that was held by The Prophet Joseph Smith. Lethe then holds the children's hands continuing the legacy. She tells the childen that Jesus was a real man as well, but not just a man, but the Son of God.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279462</url></doc>
