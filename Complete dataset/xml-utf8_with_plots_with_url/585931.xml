<plot>The Red Door is a blood-drenched psychological mystery through the distorted gaze of Lynda and her fantasy self, Loma, heroines who both try to redeem Lynda from a tragic past. Described as a modern "Giallo" film-a reference to the Italian exploitation shockers of the '60s and'70s- The Red Door takes us through a dark and visually striking journey set in the streets of Hollywood and in the bent mind of its heroine Lynda.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?585931</url></doc>
