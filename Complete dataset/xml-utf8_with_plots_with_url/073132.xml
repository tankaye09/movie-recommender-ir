<plot>Black Jack is the coming-of-age story of Jacky, a young, frivolous adventurer, searching for an identity and thirsty for love. As he is swept into the world of crime, he falls in love with a beautiful casino dealer and learns from her that in order to survive he must remain true to himself, and take responsibility for his own life. While Jacky is working as a hotel bellboy, he befriends a woman who entices him to rob her husband, a diamond dealer. During the robbery, Jacky is apprehended by a corrupt policeman named Reuben, who offers him to share the loot and split. Their encounter is caught on camera and the two are sent to jail, where they become buddies. Once released, they set up a used car lot. One evening, Jacky loses all his money in a game of Black Jack, and finds himself in debt to the tough gangster who owns the casino. As he tries to get out of this mess, Sophie the card dealer suggests that they rob the big boss. Jackie likes the idea, and adds his friend Reuben to the party. Tension develops as the dominant Reuben does not get along with Sophie, while Jacky unsuccessfully courts her. He becomes even more threatened when the boss's bodyguard tracks him down. At the moment of truth, Jacky takes matters into his own hands, and shows his partners the mettle he is made of.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073132</url></doc>
