<plot>Leatherface Speaks is an informal Q&amp;A with cult actor Gunnar Hansen, the man behind the mask of Leatherface in Tobe Hooper's seminal shocker The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The interview was conducted at Britain's National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television during a one-day event called American Nightmares in June 2000 and it takes place against an atmospheric backdrop as Hansen talks candidly about the film and role that has made him a horror icon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?327915</url></doc>
