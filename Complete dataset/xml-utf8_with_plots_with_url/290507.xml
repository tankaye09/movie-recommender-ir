<plot>Rajan and Rajni have been married for several years but are childless. Rajni goes to worship Hindu Devas and Devis in various temples in order to give birth, but this irritates Rajan. Then late one night when Rajni goes to Baba Bhairavnath to seek his blessings, Rajan follows her, thinking she is having an affair, and ends up killing Bhairavnath, prompting his evil brother, Bhootnath, to kill Rajan, and curse Rajni with a devil child. Shortly thereafter, Rajni gives birth to a male deformed child, Bhootnath takes possession of the child and leaves it in an open grave. The monstrous child grows up quickly and starts killing the townspeople one by one - and there is no power on Earth that can stop it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290507</url></doc>
