<plot>Dark Evolution is a sci-fi short based on the live action role-playing game with the same name that is set in post-apocalyptic future. This dark world is rife with violence, technology, and biogenics. It is the law of the fittest. Dark Evolution tells the tale of a cohesive team, and its struggle to survive. Each individual team member has complementing strengths and unique qualities that make the team stronger as a whole. But something goes terribly wrong. They were setup, and there is nowhere they can turn for help. They have been marked for death, and the only way to survive is to break up the team they have been a part of most of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?127149</url></doc>
