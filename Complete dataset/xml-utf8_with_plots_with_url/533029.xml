<plot>During their first weekend at college, Mike and George sneak into a bar to watch a beautiful erotic dancer. They get more than they expected when they find a lost credit card. Instead of turning it in, the boys decide to use it for one night of rousing hedonism. Using a vacationing friend's apartment, they order the most seductive 'Teasers' their new found credit line can buy. Things get too hot to handle as the police eventually catch up to them. As the two young men sit and await their fate in the police station, they are given one telephone call. Who do they call?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?533029</url></doc>
