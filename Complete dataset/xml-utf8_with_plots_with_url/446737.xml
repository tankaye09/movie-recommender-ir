<plot>This rock-driven description of life shows how providence can play a huge factor in the lives of both lovers and friends. Two best friends and band mates, Mark Walker and Jake Peterson, are currently fumbling through their respective romances and are attempting to cope with their insufficiencies through each other and the music. However, their romantic lives, which serve to inspire their success, may also be tearing them apart. Mark is diving into the band to catch the attention of his star-crossed love, Christina. Christina, however, is engaged to Mark's boss, Brett. When Mark discovers that Brett is cheating, he must decide where his loyalties lie, even if it means ruining his friendship with her as well as losing his job. Jake, on the other hand, just might be digging himself deep enough into the band to hollow out a grave for his marriage. Jake's wife, Marissa, has been becoming more distant from her husband's music scene, and the resulting chasm is causing him to lose faith in both the music and the woman he loves. Marissa is also hiding a secret that may shake him to the core. Fortunately for both Mark and Jake, Fate intercedes, to bring them and those they love closer to an understanding of Providence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446737</url></doc>
