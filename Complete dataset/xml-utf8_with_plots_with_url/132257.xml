<plot>Children with two fathers or two mothers are not an exception these days. Lesbian and gay parents are more and more accepted. Lately a new form of parenthood develops; gay- and lesbian co-parenting. In The Mamas and the Papas director Janine Bakker portrays a gay and a lesbian couple who want to have a baby and do the upbringing together, with all four of them. Iris, Manon, Edward and Patrick will share parental rights. The film starts with their wish to become parents and follows them during pregnancy, childbirth and the first months of their newborn. During the pregnancy Iris and Manon, Edward and Patrick realize that good intentions are not enough. The juridical aspects are complicated. Iris, the biological mother, gets more emotional. She is not sure she really wants to share the baby and Patrick feels left-out because of the focus on the pregnancy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?132257</url></doc>
