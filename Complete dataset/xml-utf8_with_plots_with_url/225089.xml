When Johnny Hung left, Gogo stood alone on top of a mountain of dead bodies. King of the city's underworld. Tonight Gogo is at war with the Federov family. And tonight Johnny Hung is back in town. Haris, Vigor and Marco were given a very simple job. Escort Johnny Hung from the airport to his target. They screwed up. Massivle. Repeatedly.
