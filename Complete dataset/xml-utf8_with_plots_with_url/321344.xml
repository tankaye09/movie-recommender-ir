<plot>"A magnificent picture of the launching of the 'Oceanic,' which up to that time was the largest vessel ever floated. The view is taken from a pier out over the water; the vessel coming stern on towards the camera and passing it by. A tremendous wave is thrown among the spectators crowded at the side of the pier, and the great excitement prevailing is very evident in the picture."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321344</url></doc>
