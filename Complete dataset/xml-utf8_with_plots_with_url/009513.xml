<plot>Doug wants to be like any other Hong Kong Chinese, and that is to be rich. Why? So he can pick up girls. Without money to buy brand names and live in a million-dollar condo, he is out of luck. That is, until a bathroom attendant convinces him he has the body to be a gigolo. He becomes one, but with a conscience. Later, after his "success," he falls for a client. He promises to quit the life of a gigolo, until one day he is tested...by his girlfriend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009513</url></doc>
