<plot>This entry in the series has five feature stories. The first one takes us to New York City and shows a class in the art of diamond cutting. Europeans are now bringing this skill to the USA. In Bremen Indiana, 'Rex R. Anderson' (qv) tows what appears to be a one-story house behind him. Turns of a crank raise the outer walls and turn the abode into a full two-story house. The next stop is Ottawa, Illinois, where we watch how small, round marbles are made in the world's largest marble factory. The owner gives away about $20,000 worth of marbles each year. In Waukesha, Wisconsin, eccentric inventor 'Russell E. Oakes' (qv) has invented a machine that recycles paper napkins. The last stop is Nashville, Tennessee. Here we visit a plant that assembles the Vultee Vengeance dive bomber and see several test bombing runs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?439074</url></doc>
