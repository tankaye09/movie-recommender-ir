<plot>Ten horse-drawn pieces of equipment of the Buffalo Fire Department pass by a stationary camera that looks down a broad avenue as they come toward it. They vary greatly in size, from a small two-wheeled runabout on which two men stand to three large wagons with six or eight fire fighters each drawn by two or three horses. Two of the wagons have steaming engines for pumping water, and the final wagon looks as if it carries a large mounted nozzle. Where's the fire?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085790</url></doc>
