<plot>Rats is a twisted tale of intrigue and betrayal set in the seamy yet seductive underbelly of Los Angeles's criminal fringe. In it, small time crook, Josh Green, decides to make a move to improve his fortunes by relieving his ruthless boss of a priceless jewel. He hatches an intricate plot, leaving no detail to chance, which he executes with craftsman-like precision. Just when he thinks he is home free, however, he discovers that the best laid plans of mice and men -- or in this case, rats and men -- often go astray. In the end, the tables are turned as the culprit becomes the victim in a world where nothing is what it seems and every man is out for himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?456033</url></doc>
