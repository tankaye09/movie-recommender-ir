<plot>This is rather a complete Midway of some great exposition, and is the only film we know of that shows so many different varieties of merry-go-rounds and scenic railways, beside the thousands of persons who have congregated there to witness and take part in the sights. It is a film that will please the masses, decidedly interesting from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?553251</url></doc>
