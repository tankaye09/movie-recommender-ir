<plot>Tells the horrific story of a Charles Manson type of character ordering his three impressionable followers to kill or be killed when four teenage brothers and their Mother are shot execution-style in their rural Indiana home in 1977. The brothers are killed but the Mother survives as she plays dead after having her wig blown off from a bullet to the back of her head. After the shootings, the four teenage killers go their separate ways and it takes even the FBI to finally bring them to justice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381836</url></doc>
