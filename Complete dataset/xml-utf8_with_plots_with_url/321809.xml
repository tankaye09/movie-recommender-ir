<plot>Syria, 1967, rumors of war. Abu Kamel, a peasant who farms tomatoes near Latakia, bullies his family. One by one, each rebels against him or finds a route to break away. One daughter marries, another has a clandestine relationship with a cobbler too fearful to ask Abu Kamel for her hand. A son away at university (at great cost to his parents) turns his back on his father's values and his father's plans; another son breaks a family taboo and turns to the army for a new start. The youngest wants to go to the city to study. Abu Kamel's long-suffering wife, Moti'an, may be called away. Tomato prices fall; jackals howl at night. Kamel needs a new center. Can an old dog learn new tricks?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321809</url></doc>
