<plot>It is late 1940's when the beautiful countess of Rudlov disappears. The legend blames the monster, the people blame the lagoon. Nearly 50 years later, the spirited Ilona Rudlov is a struggling ballerina living in New York and working in a strip club. When the Velvet Revolution occurs, she decides to go to Bohemia to reclaim her ancestor's castle. There she falls in love with a young hunter and experiences a mystical apparition of the creature. With the help of an old man (unaware that it is her grandfather,) Ilona escapes the creature's grasp. In the beautiful wilderness of the Bohemian mountains, Ilona is faced with the betrayal of love and the painful realization that the dreams of her youth have not come true.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077898</url></doc>
