<plot>Saving Planet Earth is a comedy showing the dangers of leaving climate change in the hands of politicians. A European president wants to solve climate change, in order to make his mark on history. Looking for a grandiose gesture, he finances a space mission to bring back a new planet. Although he plans ecopower, his understanding is confused and his real interest is in raising ever bigger taxes and getting a Nobel prize.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479178</url></doc>
