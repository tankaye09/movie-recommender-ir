<plot>Red Princess Blues Animated: The Book of Violence is an animated short film prequel to Alex Ferrari's upcoming feature film Red Princess Blues. Artist extraordinaire and Creative Director of the Visual Effects House Numb Robot, Dan Cregan will be making his directorial debut. RPB Animated is a chance to explore the world of "Princess," the main character of Red Princess Blues. In this tale we meet her as a 12 year old little girl who finds herself in a strange country looking for her father. She is then taken in by a "unique" looking man who goes by Nino. The short film is completely from the perspective of Princess and what she is going through. She soon discovers the "Book of Violence" and slowly begins her journey that one day will lead to vengeance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458263</url></doc>
