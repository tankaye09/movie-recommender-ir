<plot>Audrey, an innocent teenage girl has fallen in love with Kyler, her childhood best friend. Due to the pressures of popularity and his need for male acceptance, Kyler betrays his true feelings for her, which leaves Audrey to deal with her own insecurities. Audrey, now destitute and heart-broken, becomes easily persuaded by magazines that convince her that she doesn't fit the socially conditioned glass slipper; even while her gay best friend, who is confined to a wheel chair, urges her to find her own strength. As the pressure to conform and reduce individuality rise, the possible risks of plastic surgery become an imminent reality once Audrey insists on plastic surgery without her mother's knowledge. In seeking to solve her problems with a superficial fix, will she improve her situation or find disaster?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216268</url></doc>
