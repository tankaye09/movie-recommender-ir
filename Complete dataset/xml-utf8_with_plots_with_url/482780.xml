<plot>This is a fine piece of comedy from start to finish. A party of excursionists are grouped on the stern of a fast running boat. They are having a jolly time, wining and dining. One of the excursionists, who is a thin and rather delicate looking person, is suddenly taken ill, and discovers that he has business to attend to which calls him to the rail of the ship. He is laughed at by a rather stout individual, who thinks it a great joke, until he himself has business of the same nature to attend to at the rail of the ship. There seems suddenly to be a bond of sympathy between the fat and lean individuals, which greatly enhances the humorous situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482780</url></doc>
