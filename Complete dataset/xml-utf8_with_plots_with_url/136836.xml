<plot>Denim is the hilarious story of a date gone wrong, as discussed in a pub by drinking buddies Jim and Phil. In a series of flashbacks, Jim finds himself in over his head while on a date with the "soap opera hot" Alice. In order to stay afloat, Jim exploits the one common link between them, Bruce Springsteen. His plan works, but he has no idea the price he'll have to pay!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?136836</url></doc>
