<plot>The story begins at a pool hall, where sixteen year old Jamie, meets her first love while she and her best friend Marie are skipping class one day. Lying about her age, she pursues a relationship with the much older Jimmy, a small time drug dealer and all around bad boy. When her mother finds out, she runs away and moves in to the dank hotel room where her boyfriend lives. There, life takes a turn for the worse when Jimmy is arrested and the hotel clerk attempts to lure her into prostitution to pay the rent. Now in possession of Jimmy's 1959 Chevrolet Brookwood station wagon, she must learn to drive and look for a new place to call home. With no place to go, she hits the highway where she runs out of gas and encounters a new love, Scott. As two detectives search for the runaway teen, one struggles with his ethics and about becoming attracted to the young girl's single mother. His partner, who has been assigned to interview Jamie's estranged father, finds himself compelled to help the desperate man find a way out of his debilitating depression by bringing to light a secret that has kept him untrue to himself and others. Meanwhile, Jamie's situation becomes more desperate when she finds out that Scott is not who he seems to be. Faced with the truth about him, she takes some drugs she finds in the glove box of the car, and attempts to navigate the vehicle toward home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564442</url></doc>
