<plot>A simple-minded, yet loving young couple, Rajoo (Sunil Dutt), and his wife Maya, who allow their child to be adopted by Rajoo's sister-in-law/Bhabhi, Shanti (Kamini Kaushal). Shanti's child was still-born after an accident. But Shanti does not know this, and believes the child to be her own. She is misled and misguided by Gangajali (Lalita Pawar), and as a result Rajoo and Maya are humiliated, not allowed to come near the child, asked to leave the house, and ultimately are charged with kidnapping the child. Rafi's joyful song "Aaj mera haal na poocho..."; and Lata's lullaby "Sohya mera pyar aanchal me pehli bar...", are still popular on radio.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366436</url></doc>
