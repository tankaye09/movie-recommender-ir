<plot>Between the lines is a visually lyrical experimental documentary about women who cut themselves. The film is about gray areas in women's relationship to their bodies in the context of deliberate selfharm. the women in this film negotiate the fine lines between self destructive behavior and self-preserving coping mechanisms, as well as personal marking and the record keeping of experiences that defy language.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067159</url></doc>
