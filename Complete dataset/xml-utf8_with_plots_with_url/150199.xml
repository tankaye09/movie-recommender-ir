<plot>Vijay (Jeetendra) is a Crime Reporter and very often helps the police in apprehending criminals. When his stepmother (Kamini Kaushal) passes away, she asks him to look after his step-brother, Anand (Vijay Arora), which he promises to do so. Thinking that some girl named Saroj (Moushumi Chatterjee) is taking advantage of Anand, he secretly marries her, and abandons her. Vijay's mentor is Rai saheb (Ashok Kumar), who had deserted his wife (Nirupa Roy) and his daughter Saroj, and son, Chandu (Rakesh Roshan). Rai saheb unknowingly hires Saroj as a lady servant for his two daughters, one of whom is Laxmi (Sarika) who is secretly in love with Vijay, and other one, very young, is handicapped and confined to a wheelchair. Vijay and her dad want Laxmi to marry Anand, which she refuses. Chandu has fallen into bad company of a criminal boss (Prem Chopra) and his sidekick Kitty (Komila Virk). Unknowingly Chandu assaults his very own father, and kidnaps his younger sister to satisfy the boss. Saroj is determined to honor the marriage, but Vijay is not. Will these two ever get together? Will it be too late for Chandu to make amends?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150199</url></doc>
