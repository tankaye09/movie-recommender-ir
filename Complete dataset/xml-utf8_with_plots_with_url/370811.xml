<plot>Minette's journey of self discovery, and sometimes self fabrication, includes tales of being born on the Bowery, transforming into a female impersonator at the suggestion of his shrink, being run out of Boston by the Cardinal in the 50's and his days in the early Gay Liberation movement. A charming and disarming story of a long and fascinating life peppered with personal recollections of friends he has met along the way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370811</url></doc>
