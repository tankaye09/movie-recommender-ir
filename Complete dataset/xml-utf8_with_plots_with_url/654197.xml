<plot>A nurse girl in the park leaves her infant unattended while she chats with a park policeman. A tramp, seizing the opportunity, takes the baby's bottle. The nurse discovers the loss and is very indignant. The cop sets out to find the tramp and locates him asleep under a tree. The policeman beats the tramp's feet, but the tramp refuses to stir. The policeman then takes the tramp by the foot and attempts to pull him from the bench, but the leg comes off. In spite of his loss, however, the tramp gets up and runs away.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654197</url></doc>
