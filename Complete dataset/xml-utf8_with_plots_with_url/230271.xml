<plot>Lizzy Lyons' life sucks. She's eighteen, unemployed, broke and hopelessly in love with her wannabe rockstar boyfriend Matt. On the very day Lizzy finds out she's pregnant, she also finds herself the unwitting subject of a twisted television exposé perpetrated by the new world standard of unethical journalism: Hardcore Action News. Growing up isn't easy these days. Money's tight, relationships are tough and all around us, media and advertising constantly bombard us with competing messages. Meet a struggling young citizen of our chaotic attention deficit world: Lizzy Lyons. She's eighteen, unemployed, broke and hopelessly in love with her wannabe rockstar boyfriend Matt. On the very day Lizzy finds out she's pregnant, she also finds herself the unwitting subject of a twisted television exposé perpetrated by the new world standard of unethical journalism: Hardcore Action News. Using surveillance, bribery and conspiracy, HAN's blonde and busty investigative reporter, Fallopia Wigglesworth spins a bizarre web of deceit to net her young and vulnerable prey. Fallopia offers Lizzy the chance to become a pioneer in the most revolutionary field of modern medical science: In-utero advertising. If all goes according to plan, Lizzy's baby will be born a hyper-intelligent consumer, ready to plug and play in our dollar driven world. This could be Lizzy's only chance to start a new life and recreate the family she tragically lost as a child. Or this could be the start of a nightmare - the likes of which she could never have imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230271</url></doc>
