<plot>For years, urban legends have warned about an isolated Southern town where the locals ran-off their police department and outsiders fear to tread. To blues musician Big Mike Griffin, Iron City seemed like the perfect subject for a song. However, first, he must find out for himself if the legends are true. Join Big Mike and his guide, a cigar-chomping ex-Marine named Jason Neese, as they ride their Harleys through Tennessee's backwoods into a place that even cops fear. You'll meet a collection of unforgettable characters as you witness the creation of a blues song about the most notorious town in the South. Welcome to Iron City. Watch your back.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268576</url></doc>
