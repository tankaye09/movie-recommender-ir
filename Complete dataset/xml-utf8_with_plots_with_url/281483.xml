<plot>Jump 'n' go! Baron Aloha's greed! The Time: Far in the future The Place: Deep in space The Problem: Vanishing real estate! Viperous Baron Aloha has cooked up a diabolical scheme! He is stealing our planet--piece by piece! The evil astrophysicist has excavated vast chunks of the Earth, enslaved the inhabitants, and shuttled the whole works off into space as his own galactic continents! Greedy Aloha has turned our serene world into Swiss cheese to make his own private resorts! Can anybody - or anything - stop him? Robbit, the Super De-Pester Yes! One brave robot can do the job. Robbit, the perfect pest eradicator, is specially built to make bug juice out of Baron Aloha and his swarms of verminous helpers. Aloha has unplugged the Jet Pods that propel each world, and stashed them somewhere in the realm. Only he knows where they are. If Robbit can recover the Jet Pods, he can reclaim the world! Jump and go! Robbit's got the attitude. Can you stand the altitude?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281483</url></doc>
