<plot>An Islamic judge in north of Iran condemned a zealous Christian convert, Mehdi Dibaj, from Islam to death. His crime was apostasy. Dibaj had already served ten years in prison. Haik Hovsepian, the leader of Evangelical Christians of Iran, chose to speak out and launch an international campaign for Dibaj's sentence to be overturned. Haik's campaign was successful, and Dibaj was released only a few days before his execution date. But, there was a price to pay... On January19,1994, Bishop Haik Hovsepian disappeared. Twelve days later his corpse was identified by his son. The body had been stabbed 26 times. He was not the last to be martyred. Since then several other Christians have been brutally tortured and put to death. This is the untold story of their sacrifices, courage, commitment and faith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009051</url></doc>
