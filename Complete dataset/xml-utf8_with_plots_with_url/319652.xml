<plot>A story related to economics, big and small, to pleasure (1.100 million of people smoke) and to health; according to the World Health Organization every minute six people die in the world because of tobacco. An appetizing business and a deadly pleasure. Europe, who criticizes smoking, is also the first beneficiary of the tobacco business through taxes and although it battles against this legal drug, it also subsidizes the tobacco manufacture in countries like Spain and Turkey. For the first time an Spanish television team has obtained license to enter the packaging factory that Tabacalera has in Logroño. There, it has obtained images of the most secret procedure in the manufacture of cigarettes: seasoning. A bunch of products, like cacao, mint, cognac, coffee, urea, ammonia and vinegar that are added to tobacco to make cigarette flavor more pleasant, but, first and foremost, to reinforce the action of nicotine, to give it an even stronger addictive power.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319652</url></doc>
