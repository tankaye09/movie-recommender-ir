<plot>Terry Wiles was first featured in 1979 in ON GIANT'S SHOULDERS and told the story of his early years. A victim of Thalidomide, he was adopted and with his new family emigrated to New Zealand. This documentary tells of the fight Terry, now in his 30s, and his wife have had since they married. Ostracised by their families and recipients of hate mail, they have been married for eight years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193794</url></doc>
