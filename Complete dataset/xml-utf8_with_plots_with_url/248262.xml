<plot>Andy (Andy Clyde) runs a flophouse hotel but does have his standards...no women, kids or pets. So, first rattle out of the box, the local orphange burns down and the sheriff delivers a dozen orphans for Andy to board. This is not a situation to Andy's liking. He also does not like it when he is about to lose his hotel for failure to make his mortgage payments. But the kids stage a show and save the old homestead for Andy. Daisy the Dog, from the "Blondie" movies, is fifth-billed in the cast listing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248262</url></doc>
