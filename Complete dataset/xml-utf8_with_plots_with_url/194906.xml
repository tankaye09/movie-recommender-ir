<plot>Tired of being put in a box and relegated to making certain music and being viewed a certain way because of corporate stereotyping, artists are finally getting their views off their chests. 'Finally Sayin' What I Really Mean' is a feature length music documentary that, through conversations with various musical artists, poets, and social activists, explores the question of what good music is, and further discusses stepping outside of the industry's definition of what their music should be and how it should be represented. Over 30 signed and independent artists including Saul William s, Lalah Hathaway, Martin Luther, David Banner, Chamillionaire, and others, talk freely and openly about the music industry and how their music or image is stuffed in a box, packaged and sold. The documentary explores hip hop as a cultural voice, soul music as a movement and the art and creativity of poetry as the basis for it all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?194906</url></doc>
