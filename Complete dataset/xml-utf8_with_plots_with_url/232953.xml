<plot>It's springtime in the Ukraine and a healthy young man's thoughts naturally turn to wrestling. Yes, that's right. The ancient art of Greco-Roman grappling becomes youthful obsession and exciting entertainment in Baikal Films' latest kid-sport's spectacular HEADLOCK. Beginning in the days of the old Soviet Union, there was an eternal quest to find and nurture the best athletes. And to that end, every local coach became a talent scout for the State selecting out the most promising youngsters. Some as young as seven were sent on to elite, state-run boarding schools. There, along with the usual academic requirements, these budding sports superstars would train daily in hopes of one day representing their country in world-class competitions. This amazing tradition continues today in the Ukraine and its success shines bright on the handsome, happy faces of the amazing and inspiring adolescent athletes you'll come to love in HEADLOCK.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232953</url></doc>
