<plot>An impossible dream. An undefeated perfect season. The fulfillment of a national championship. Pittsburgh Passion is the inside-look at the growing sport of women's full-contact football in the United States. The film profiles athletes from immeasurably different walks of life who overcame all physical and historical odds to pioneer a new sport for a nation. From backyard ball to screaming stadiums, and from local newspapers to ESPN -- it is as much about the human heart and having dreams as it is about football.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434201</url></doc>
