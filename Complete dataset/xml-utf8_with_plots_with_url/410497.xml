<plot>Christmastime in the midwest means snow, lights and lots of decorations. Brendan McConville is a teenage boy who makes a mockery of his elderly neighbor's, Bull Harrington, decorations. When his mother informs him that Mr. Harrington recently lost his wife, Brendan volunteers to help Mr. Harrington put up his Christmas decorations and clear his guilty conscience. Of course, Brendan will have to come clean when Mr. Harrington uncovers the truth. As snowballs fly, Brendan and Bull understand the old adage, tis' better to give than to receive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410497</url></doc>
