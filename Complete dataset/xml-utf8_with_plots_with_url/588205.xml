<plot>Tipu and his family are the Ruti-Eaters. They come from Bangladesh and are in America for a new way of life, but their ways and their dress draw suspicion from neighbors who eventually watch them to the point of harassment because they think it is their duty as law-abiding citizens. In response, Tipu fights back the only way he knows in this quirky and warm-hearted short.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?588205</url></doc>
