<plot>On the eve of his 27th birthday, a multi-platinum Rock Star, on a day off in Paris during a worldwide tour, stumbles across an article about the 27 Club, a list of incredibly talented Rock legends whose lives ended abruptly during their 27th year. As the next few weeks pass, he becomes obsessed with the list and the stories behind each of the members. Slowly almost methodically, every stable part of his life begins to unravel, and spiral out of control, pushing him closer to joining the list. As he tries to pull out of the spin, and looks to put at least one piece of his life back together, he uncovers that a series of events caused the last miscue and that it wasn't just a chance occurrence. Upon further investigation he begins to notice connections between several of the deaths and a common thread, which links most of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383195</url></doc>
