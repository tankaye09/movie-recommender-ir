<plot>While orbiting the Earth, the Commander and First Mate of the Orion space capsule bear witness to the demise of all life on the planet below. With only eighty five days of oxygen left, the two astronauts must decide how they will spend their remaining time. The First Mate attempts to reestablish his routine by continuing the experiment they were sent to space to complete. The Commander, overwhelmed with the futility of the First Mate's actions, suggests that they take the provided cyanide pills. The First Mate ignores this request and even tries to extend the amount of oxygen they have by drawing power from unnecessary systems. Everything comes to a head, when the First Mate's rewiring sets off the automatic fire extinguishers, and he must finally face the reality of the situation. The two astronauts reach an awkward compromise that appeals to both sensibilities.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?634968</url></doc>
