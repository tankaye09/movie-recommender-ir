<plot>This film shows a crowd of bathers at a natatorium, including high diving, somersaults in mid-air, etc., and is universally pronounced to be one of the most popular films ever shown. The most comical effect can be produced from this film by reversing and running it backwards. The bathers come up from the water feet first, and springing upwards through the air in this reversed position alight on the springboard. An illusion which never fails to bring down the house.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060837</url></doc>
