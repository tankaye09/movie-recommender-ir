<plot>A comical cookout course with "The Cookout" culinary experts Willie &amp; Nelson...twins Jared and Jamal Mixon. Jared &amp; Jamal share their simple steps to a cookout your friends and family will always remember. For those who are gastronomically inclined, our grill masters offer insight from their vast cookout experience ranging from the correct way to flip a burger (in your mouth) to the right balance of food groups (read: all) to the appropriate garnish (anything edible). For the Martha Stewart fans, J&amp;J will also reveal the fine art of proper cookout presentation - Gingham tablecloths and plastic forks &amp; knives, of course, as well as proper backyard BBQ etiquette (forget the forks &amp; knives, if you wanna really enjoy it use your hands! Forget everything those cooking shows taught you, this is the definitive HOW TO that will put a smile on your face!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651772</url></doc>
