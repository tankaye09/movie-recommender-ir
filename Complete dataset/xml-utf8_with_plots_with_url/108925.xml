<plot>Close Up: Portraits features a roster of the world's top photographers, caught in the creative act, behind the camera. As captured through the lens of Albert Maysles, a legendary filmmaker (Gimme Shelter, Salesman, Grey Gardens) and photographer in his own right, the intimate moments of fellow artists in their creative element are brought to life. Artist to artist, photographer to photographer, Close Up: Portraits explores the philosophies and techniques with which the photographers approach every shot. The images the world knows and loves, the photographers that create them: Maysles Films' Close Up: Portaits is a window into the creative state of mind of some of today's top working photographers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108925</url></doc>
