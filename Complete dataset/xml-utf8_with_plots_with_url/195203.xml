<plot>The seventh of Universal's sound-era serials (slid between two Tim McCoy serials, "The Indians Are Coming" and "Heroes of the Flames") has secret service agent Gary Gordon assigned to run down a band of smugglers known as the River Gang. Unknown to him, John Mackey, father of his sweetheart Lola, is a member of the gang. When Mackey's partner Joe Burke is killed, Kent Martin claims he has evidence that will convict Mackey of the crime, and tries to blackmail Mackey to gain his consent to a marriage with Lola. The latter is not thrilled at this prospect and even less thrilled is Martin's sweetheart Jane Madden. When the blackmail ploy fails, the ever-romantic Martin kidnaps Lola and takes her to his cave hide-out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195203</url></doc>
