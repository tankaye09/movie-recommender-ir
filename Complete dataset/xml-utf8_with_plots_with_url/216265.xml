<plot>This film documents Jewish daily life in Girona, a city in the northeastern Spanish region of Catalonia, from its "Golden Age" in the middle ages through the expulsion of Spanish Jewry in 1492 and up to the present day. Recognized as the "Mother of Israel," a name given to just a few sites in the world considered Jewish spiritual resting places, Girona was once home to an important school of Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) and holds a significant place in Jewish history. In addition to interviews with historians, the film includes Catalan-Ladino folk music and footage of Girona's Jewish quarter as it appears today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216265</url></doc>
