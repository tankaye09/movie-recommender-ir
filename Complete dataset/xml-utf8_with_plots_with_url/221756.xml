<plot>A gangly young girl (M. C. Brennan) strolls onto a basketball court and makes numerous painfully bad attempts to make a basket. After one of the misses, the ball bounces into the lap of jer watchful Grandma, a 99-year old lady in a wheelchair (Mae Owen), who launches a long-range bomb that sails through the hoop. Agitated, the girl moves the old woman farther away, but "Grandma" takes this as a challenge, snatches the ball away and lets sail another perfect long-distance shot. The furious girl spins Grandma around backwards so she can't see the basket, daring her to shoot, which she does with a laugh. Finally, the girl blindfolds Grandma, who makes trick shot after trick shot in reverse. The girl swipes the ball from Grandma and shoots a vengeful basket which ricochets off the rim and bonks her on the head, delighting Grandma and the assembled crowd. Shot at various film speeds for a "silent film" effect and featuring early '30s recordings by the Mills Brothers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?221756</url></doc>
