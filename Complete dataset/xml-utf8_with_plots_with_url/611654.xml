<plot>A mockumentary about the filming of the second season of Tom Goes to the Mayor, co-created by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim. Creative differences turn total control of the show to Eric, while Tim is forced to look for menial work as Bob Odenkirk's intern's assistant, occasionally showing up at the Tom office, bitter, lonely and desperate. Meanwhile, Louie Anderson comes aboard as Tim's creative replacement and Michael Cera takes over the part of Tom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611654</url></doc>
