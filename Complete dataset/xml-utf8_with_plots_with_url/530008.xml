<plot>Osman earns his living as a porter. He lives in a small house with his wife, children and mother-in-law. He is in debt from top to toes. His wife and mother-in-law belittle him a lot. Osman buys a lottery ticket from Sakir and hides it somewhere. As he finds out that the the jackpot has been won by one of the tickets Sakir has sold, he believes that the lucky person is himself! He is happy to be a millionaire! Everybody hears this and in the neighborhood they treat him extraordinarily kind and spoil him with gifts. But the truth comes out as he finds the ticket - he has won nothing! Now all his fake friends blame him and even send him to court for deceiving them. The Lottery Institution hears about Osman, and offers him to take part in their commercials of the Lottery. However, Osman doesn't want to even hear about the word "lottery"!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?530008</url></doc>
