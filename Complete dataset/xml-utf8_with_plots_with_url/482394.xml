<plot>Used to be, Bill and Gooley were best of friends. They grew up in a small town, went to high school together and both loved the same girl, Louise. After graduation, Louise married Gooley and they settled down together as a young farming couple. Bill started roaming the ditches, looking for people's cast-aways. Funny thing was, Louise grew up. Bill and Gooley stayed about the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482394</url></doc>
