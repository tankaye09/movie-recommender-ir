<plot>Herbert H Woolworth, great-grandson of the great FW Woolworth, spends his last few days on earth much as he has spent his entire life, obsessed with New York's Woolworth Building. His obsession leads him into contact with agents from another dimension who transport Herbert to that other world. Ninety-six years later, Nathan DuPree arrives in this other world, where Herbert has been trapped for almost a century. Herbert has been plotting his escape, and Nathan DuPree's arrival may be the moment he's been waiting for. Finally, the Narrator, who has led us through this tale, explains everything before receiving a strange visitor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?390505</url></doc>
