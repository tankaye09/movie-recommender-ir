<plot>Flush everything you've seen in other home renovation series before sitting down to The Outhouse. This series takes a decidedly comic point-of-view to the seriousness of home renovation! In every episode two of the crappiest homes in a neighborhood are chosen to have their exteriors glamorized under the watchful eye of our 2 comedic hosts, Brad and Chris (who just happen to be identical twins), and a team of contractors. Working with a $5,000 budget each homeowner team has just 48 hours to work their magic. Who will win the coveted "Golden Outhouse" trophy? You'll find out at The Outhouse Street Party, where the neighbors vote on who best turned crap into gold. The blood, sweat and tears of home renovation have never been so funny!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580964</url></doc>
