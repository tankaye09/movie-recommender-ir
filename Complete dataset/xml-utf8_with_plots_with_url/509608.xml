<plot>Special Mike is a good-natured bachelor. Honey Girl is Special Mike's adoring roommate. The problem is Special Mike's cluelessness to Honey Girl's affection. There's also that other problem. You see, Honey Girl is Special Mike's dog. More than a story about a man and his best friend, "Special Mike and Honey Girl" is a tale of true obsession. Okay, it's comic obsession, but obsession nonetheless. When another woman enters their lives, Honey Girl launches into action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509608</url></doc>
