<plot>Filmed during Bad Religion's August 1989 Suffer European Tour, Along the Way shows Bad Religion playing gig's in their early 20's. This was filmed during an entire European Tour then mixed together so it's not uncommon to see the band warping from concert venues or changing T-shirts. It is also mixed together with interviews from the band members at the time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032619</url></doc>
