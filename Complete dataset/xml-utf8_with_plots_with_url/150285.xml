<plot>Illiterate Banke Lal lives a fairly wealthy lifestyle in a village along with his widowed mom, Laxmi. He has earned an award from the Government as well as had been interviewed on All India Radio as he had excelled in farming. He is in love with Parvati, the daughter of the village Sarpanch, Charandas. When Charandas refuses to permit him to wed Parvati as she is more educated, Banke vows to wed a city-bred woman who is even more qualified than Parvati. He re-locates to Bombay, and after a few weeks return home with his new bride, Lata. Shortly thereafter chaos reigns in his life when he finds out that Lata is a mentally unstable runaway bride, her to-be spouse is wealthy Advocate Shamsher Singh, and the entry of Savitri - who claims that Banke married her and that she is pregnant with his child.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150285</url></doc>
