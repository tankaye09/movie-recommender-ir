<plot>"At Spuyten Duyvil there is a short stretch of track where the main branch of the New York Central and the Putnam Branch run on parallel lines, only about ten feet apart. Two of the fastest trains on the two branches frequently meet at Spuyten Duyvil, and whenever they do, a running race ensues. Our camera succeeded in taking a picture of one of these races and was placed directly between the two tracks, so that the effect is as if the two trains were rushing toward the spectator at high speed."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?587148</url></doc>
