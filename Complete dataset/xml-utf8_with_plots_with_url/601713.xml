<plot>Jeffrey and Glenda play two lovers about to embark on a three-day cruise to nowhere. Their plan is to be married on board by the ship's captain. As Glenda is packing to leave, she receives a threatening phone call from her obsessed, former lover who has taken residence just two floors above her apartment. Glenda sneaks upstairs to confront Leo and tell him that it's over. Leo, a high-powered attorney calls a hit-man to have Jeffrey eliminated. Glenda knocks Leo over the head before he can give the hitman a name. Leo is dead. Glenda sneaks back into her apartment, goes off on the cruise with Jeffrey and pretends that all is swell. Leo's partner, Stephen Bessemer, suspects Glenda and follows her to the ship. Bessemer stages a mock trial aboard the ship and cleverly draws a confession from Glenda. Jeffrey, also an attorney, represents Glenda when she is arrested upon arriving on shore. A skeptical district attorney, and the fact that Jeffrey horsewhips the star witness (the hit-man), combine to get Glenda completely off the hook.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?601713</url></doc>
