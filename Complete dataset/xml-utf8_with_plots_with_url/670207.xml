<plot>Spaceships, faster than light travel, interstellar economy, colonies scattered across the sky - even in the 2164 you need to have a job. This is one of them. Literally down to their last dime, two deep space prospectors, the crew of the Waltzing Matilda - Alex Coleman (Brian Pace) and Rick Scholer (David Woods) - have stumbled across the find of a lifetime, a solitary rock containing untold riches in monopole ore. Problem is, they may just be too desperate for anyone to take them seriously. With nothing left to lose, they manage to make a deal with an old enemy - Sandra Groves (Lisa Fugate) - and secure enough funding to survey and claim this space-borne mother lode. Mix in a dose of double cross and an old rival with an axe to grind - David Coreman (David Flemming) - and you have a workingman's tale of adventure and survival in deep space. Zero Prospect promises to be gritty, fun and as down to earth as you can get twenty-eight million light years from home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670207</url></doc>
