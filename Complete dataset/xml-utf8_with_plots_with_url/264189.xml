<plot>According to Jewish tradition, a day lasts from sunset to sunset. On Friday 14.05.1948, in a house on Rothschild St. in Tel Aviv, the ceremony of the declaration of the independence of the new State of Israel was hastily held. The time was 16:30. Several hours later, the Egyptian air force struck Tel Aviv, thus marking the beginning of the Israeli War of Independence. In the meantime, the Sabbath began, a new day commenced and so Israel was "awarded" a single day of independence. Ever since the State of Israel has been constantly in a state of war... As a tribute to this occasion, the movie was filmed during a single Independence Day. The film is a personal and national journey into the cultural, social and historical landscape of ourselves, as it examines the distinctions between the founders' intentions and the result, encounters figures who are part of this landscape and attempts to create an image for remembrance of a state on a day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264189</url></doc>
