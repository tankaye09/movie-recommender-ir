<plot>A workman glues an advertisement in the center of other adverts on an outside wall along a city walk. It's an ad for "love on credit," featuring a comely lass. The posters come to life, interacting with the characters in the surrounding adverts: a publican's wife is jealous of his talking to the midnight cutie; a cook dumps food on a character beneath him. Then, two flics walk by, and the characters become inanimate. After the cops walk on, life returns. The poster people attack a swell beneath the wall, and he runs for the cops. They return, and the wall falls on them, revealing a gate behind which the poster folks laugh. Chaos ensues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329696</url></doc>
