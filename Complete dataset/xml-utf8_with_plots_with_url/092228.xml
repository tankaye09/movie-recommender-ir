<plot>Jack Thompson, the 26-year-old, unemployed, spoiled brat, receives a rude awakening when Paul, his lover (and unlimited source of income), dies suddenly, leaving his entire estate to Wendy, his homophobic sister. Banished from Paul's house, penniless and clutching a blank sum, Jack halfheartedly follows the advice of his parents and numerous credit agencies and pursues a variety of minimum-wage jobs. He repeatedly and predictably gets fired, ultimately succumbing to the lure of easy money by becoming an "independent hustler," a trade at which he is uncannily adept. As the cash begins to roll in, he and fellow sex worker/aspiring artist Ray pool their client√®le into an agency: "Harden Up, Inc." Ray wants to get out of the business eventually and open an art gallery; in the meantime, the recruitment of new hustlers and the excitement of a growing client roster puts Jack back on top, but just how long can his luck last?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092228</url></doc>
