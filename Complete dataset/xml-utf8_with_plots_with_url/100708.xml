<plot>Scott Kramer is a young man who has been overly obsessed with filmmaker Smith, Kevin. This is a mockumentary about his fall to madness due to the real condition Chronic Obsessive Filmmaker Neurosis. Randy Appell, his best friend, narrates and tells how Scott wrote his script, "Employees" about their job at a shoe store, how they embarked on a mission with Randy to Red Bank, New Jersey to meet Smith and Mewes, Jason themselves, how Smith encouraged Kramer to make his independent film, and how afterwards Smith denied knowing him, turning Kramer into an insane stalker who was later confined to the "Filmmaker's Ward".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100708</url></doc>
