<plot>This was the pilot to the long running series, about a cop, Rick Hunter, who has two things going against him. The first is that his family is involved with organized crime. So, most of the cops don't trust him. And most of his partners get seriously injured. Now his commanding officer, Captain Cain, has it in for him. Currently, he is forcing him to see a psychiatrist, and that if he wants to work in the field, he has to have a partner and the only one who is willing to work with him, Bernie Terwilleger, a less than competent cop. Hunter then decides to team with the only other cop, who has a hard time with partners, too, Dee Dee McCall. Currently, they are working on a case involving a possible serial killer, but since Terwilliger was the first cop at the scene, it's his case. But Hunter sensing that Terwilliger will not give it his all, decides to investigate on his own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250402</url></doc>
