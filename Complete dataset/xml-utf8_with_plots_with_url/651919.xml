<plot>Funston works as a driver for a funeral home to support the family while his older brother, Ender, stays at home taking care of their sick mother. In response to the overwhelming air of sickness and sadness within the home, Ender lashes out through petty acts of delinquency while Funston cleans up the messes his brother leaves behind. Driven by nostalgia for a time when he admired his older brother, Funston agrees to take Ender along on a delivery in the hopes of restoring their relationship. When the van breaks down and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere with a rotting corpse, their already fragile relationship is pushed to the breaking point. When it comes to family, how much is enough?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651919</url></doc>
