<plot>In her mid-twenties, Jeong-hae is a postal worker who lives a monotonous daily routine. She is kind, detached, and delicate, and accepts being cut off from the outside world as natural. When she takes in a stray cat she happens to remember things about her mother, and when an aspiring writer who comes to the post office expresses interest in her, her unexplained peacefulness is shaken, and hidden trauma begins to make its way to the surface of her emotions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664832</url></doc>
