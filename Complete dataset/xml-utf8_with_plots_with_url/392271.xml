<plot>Nishad lives a wealthy and noble lifestyle with her Delhi-based dad, Khan Bahadur and mom. She has three suitors who would do anything to marry her. The first is Shaukat Khan, the son of Nawab Hamid Khan, who also comes from a noble family and meets with the approval of her dad; the second is Shibbu, who is distantly related to her mom, and also meets their approval; the third is Anwar, the only son of Nawab Ajmutullah Khan Farooqui, who was initially rejected by her parents, but is now on their approval list, as he, too, comes from a noble background. After a few dates, Nishad falls in love with Anwar, much to the chagrin of Shaukat and Shibbu. What Nishad does not know is that Anwar's dad was a Hajam (Barbar) by profession, and had assumed the title of 'Nawab' after winning a lottery. Watch what happens when Nishad and her parents find this out on the very day of her wedding to Anwar.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392271</url></doc>
