<plot>Everything is relative - especially the truth! Impulsive seven-year-old Cielle bursts in on her Mother, Marcia, as she is having sex with new boyfriend, Frank. One funny, shocking incident, which we see from their three different points of view. But which, if any, is the truth? A dark, comic, quirky take on modern family life which also explores the relative nature of truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?459601</url></doc>
