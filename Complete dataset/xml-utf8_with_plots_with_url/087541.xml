<plot>It's a typical day in Bushville. The Chief Bushman is sittin' pretty in his favorite saloon when Medianto, his trusted ally and messenger to the People, arrives on the scene. This time, however, he brings different tidings: His People KNOW he's a fraud. The People know everything! "What everything are you referending to?" The ever-eloquent Chief Bushman asks. This launches a lineup of lies and lawbreakin' that puts the most desperate of desperados and baddest of badmen to shame. Luckily for the Chief Bushman, he doesn't have to face the barrage alone. With his right hand man, the heavy gunning Rummage, the Chief Bushman is ready to do battle with the Truth and bury it once and for all!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087541</url></doc>
