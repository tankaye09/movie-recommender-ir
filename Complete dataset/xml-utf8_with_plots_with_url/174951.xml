<plot>It's Wilbur's 95th birthday. Someone brings him a slice of cake, but the festivities fail to interest him. Then, Wendy catches his eye and brings her electric wheelchair over toward him. This gets Wilbur's own motor running, and soon they're flirting with eyes and with the switches on their motorized chairs. Then Wendy heads for the exit with Wilbur is right behind. Where are they headed? Who will strike first?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174951</url></doc>
