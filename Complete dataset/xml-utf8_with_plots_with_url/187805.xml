<plot>Fairfield, Idaho is never far from Dayton Miller's mind. It's where his father shot himself in the head at 33, just as Dayton's grandfather did. Now, as Dayton nears that fateful age himself, he's facing unpaid bills, an eviction notice, and the lost faith of his long-suffering girlfriend, Maddie, and their young daughter. Seeing his salvation in a quick drug deal, Dayton unwittingly sets in motion a chain of tragic events that just may fulfill his destiny after all. Torn between the love of his family and his loathing for himself, he shuts himself up in a skid-row motel room, where, in one drug-addled night, Dayton must deal with his demons one last time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187805</url></doc>
