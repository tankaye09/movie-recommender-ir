<plot>Two composers from opposite musical worlds (ear playing and sight reading) race to learn to communicate with each other in order to meet a career-defining deadline. Will they land the job co-writing music for the biggest blockbuster movie ever, or will the blackmailing, femme fatale mother of despised unethical composer Rachmanibach succeed in setting them up to fail? Join our heroes as they sashay through film noir parodies, court rooms, psychiatrist offices and dream sequences -- and meet an odd assortment of characters who give them clues about how to understand each other. At the same time, the viewer learns how songs work, how to play music right away, and how easy (and fun) it is to LIVE OUT THEIR PIANO (and music) DREAMS!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431606</url></doc>
