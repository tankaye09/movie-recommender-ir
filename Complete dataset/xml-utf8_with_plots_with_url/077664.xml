<plot>Charades have long been a staple of TV game shows, and "Body Language" provided a return to the durable format. Two contestants, each paired with a celebrity, competed in this game. In round one, the celebrity member of the team pantomines up to five words to the contestant. Each correctly-guessed word is placed in an often-punny word puzzle containing seven blanks; at least two spaces will always be left blank. If the contestant correctly guessed the puzzle, he/she won $100; an incorrect guess allowed the contestant member of the opposing team to fill in any one of the remaining blanks Correctly guessing the puzzle was worth $100; an incorrect guess allowed the opposing team to fill in any of the remaining blanks and guess the puzzle. Round 2 was played identically, with the contestant members of the team pantomining the clues and the celebrities trying to decipher the puzzles; correct guesses were now worth $250. A tie-breaker was played if necessary, with the contestants shown a new word puzzle with seven blanks and the contestants simply calling out numbers to fill in the spaces. The first team to win $500 won the game and advanced to the two-stage bonus game. In the first part, the contestant had 60 seconds to guess up to 10 words pantomined by his/her celebrity partner, with each word worth $100. The contestant could multiply his/her winnings by 10 by guessing three additional words within 20 seconds (e.g., if the contestant won $600 in the first part, he/she would play for $6,000); up to $10,000 was possible. Contestants could lose twice before defeated; surpassing CBS' $25,000 (later, $50,000) limit retired the contestant undefeated.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077664</url></doc>
