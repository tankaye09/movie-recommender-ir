<plot>Aliki, granddaughter of a destitute fisherman, captain Kostis, meets one day at the beach an unscrupulous bad guy, Papoulas, who tries to rape her, but she is saved by a young man who accompanies him, Stefanos. To make sure that Aliki won't turn them in, Stefanos keeps Aliki in confinement while her grandfather is looking for her and notifies the sergeant of the gendarmerie of the neighboring island about her disappearance. Stefanos explains to the young girl how he was seduced into criminality by a beautiful singer, Ntina, who was Papoulas' lover and stole an amphora from a ring of antiquity smugglers. The amphora is buried on a deserted beach of the island. During his quest, Stefanos and Papoulas fight over its possession, and Papoulas is killed. Stefanos is arrested by the sergeant, who, however, believes the story that Stefanos tells him, and so he lets him free to enjoy with Aliki their love that has just began.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026145</url></doc>
