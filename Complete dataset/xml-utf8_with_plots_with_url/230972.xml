<plot>The story of the 1976 De La Roche family murders has become the stuff of urban myth and legend. But what really happened? Indeed, everyone has a breaking point, and only one person really knows. Now, after nearly 30 years, he's finally talking! HARRY:A Communications Breakdown is the documentary that separates fact from fiction. This must-see film includes an exclusive recorded video interview with Harry De La Roche. Now, for the first time ever, Harry sets the record straight. Plus, through additional testimony from classmates, teachers, and top investigators, you'll go back in time to that tragic weekend, as this film provides responses to still unanswered questions. Hear Harry's explanation for yourself, available exclusively in this documentary film. If you ever wanted to know what really happened, then this is the film you must see.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230972</url></doc>
