<plot>This grand film shows President McKinley accompanied by his suite and guard of mounted police upon the occasion of his visit to the exposition at Buffalo which proved to be his last public appearance. This picture was obtained the day before the happening of the tragedy which plunged a sorrowing nation into deepest affliction. Our martyred president is plainly seen. This successful film has proved the most popular of the numerous series which have been taken in this connection. No exhibition however humble or however large can afford to omit this film from its list.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442801</url></doc>
