<plot>At a huge baseball stadium ship it's the Pirate Baseball King playoffs. Hosted by Bon Clay/Mr. 2 &amp; Buggythe Clown. The Straw Hat Pirates are now up showing off their skills in baseball. All 7 of them are up against the Arlong Pirates(This includes Arlong, Momoo, Chuu, Kuroobi, Hacchi, and several Skypiea characters for backup on both teams). This is unlike any ordinary baseball game. As Arlong's team uses iron spiked balls instead of regular baseballs. To make Luffy and his team loose. After one strike out to another, it becomes 3-0 for the final inning. Will Luffy's team be able to defeat Arlong's team?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413046</url></doc>
