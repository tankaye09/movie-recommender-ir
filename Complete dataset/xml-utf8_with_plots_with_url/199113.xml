<plot>The human spirit pitted against the urban mindset. Nicola draws from past eras to determine his future. Unaware of the power of prose, he types out a poem. Out on his lunch hour, he stumbles upon a dead body. Propriety instinctively forces an apology. A response from the corpse has him second-guessing himself. The horror deepens by the familiar text under the man's head. Unable to ask the question directly, he engages in useless small talk. A caustic reply has him wishing escape but he's psychologically trapped. Staring into the complexity, Nicola toys with the skeleton of his own words and possibly the same fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199113</url></doc>
