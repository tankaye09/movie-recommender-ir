<plot>There are decisions in life. Some you make yourself. Some are made for you. Some you can never get back...those are the hardest to let go. After abandoning her family seven years prior, Samantha returns home for the first time since. The bomb of Samantha's arrival shatters the world her ex, Trey, has created for himself and their daughter, Emily. Looking back is never easy but the memories are there, and maybe, just maybe they're there to stay. The surprise appearance of her seven-year-old daughter she barely recognizes shakes Samantha to the bone. She must now decide how far back she is willing to delve in order to move on with the future. You can only look off into the distance for so long, before you must face what is in front of you. Will she pay the price for the memories she has left behind?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073861</url></doc>
