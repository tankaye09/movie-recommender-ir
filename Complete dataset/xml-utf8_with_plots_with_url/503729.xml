<plot>During the fall of 1942, in the Polish village of Pinczow, as the Germans deported Jews to the gas chambers, the Banya family offered to hide Israel and Frania Rubinek in their one room farmhouse. Despite enormous risk and hardship, Zofia and Ludwig Banya, along with their young son Maniek, sheltered the Rubineks for 28 months. Interweaving docu-drama sequences with archival material, this film follows Israel and Frania Rubinek on their emotional return journey to Poland, and documents their poignant reunion with Zofia Banya, the peasant woman who saved their lives 40 years earlier. Actor Saul Rubinek, co-producer of the film, accompanies his parents not only to achieve a better understanding of his family's past, but also to come to terms with his own identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503729</url></doc>
