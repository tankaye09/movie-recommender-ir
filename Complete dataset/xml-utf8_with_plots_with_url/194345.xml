<plot>Filmart Takes Position is the name of an international appeal for artistic contributions issued and organised by Sixpack Film every two or three years. Each time there is a new theme concerning a social and political topic in the widest sense of the term. Alien/Nation has been chosen as the theme of the first film reel to enable film artists publically to state their position. The upsurge of problems of social exclusion, migration, prejudice, political and governmental repression and the global feeling of threat and alienation have been the themes of the films submitted throughout 1996.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?194345</url></doc>
