<plot>"Taken at Tampa, Fla. Up the road from the camp comes a double file of cavalrymen, a hundred or more, each man leading another horse beside his own. The leader rides a magnificent dapple gray. They approach at a fast walk, with an occasional frisky animal prancing and pirouetting. As they pass by, the spirited action reminds one forcibly of Rosa Bonheur's celebrated 100,000 dollar painting, 'The Horse Fair.' The figures of both men and horses stand out in relief."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007299</url></doc>
