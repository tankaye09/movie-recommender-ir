<plot>This movie is actually called "Clubhouse detectives in Scavenger Hunt". It's about four nine-year-olds who come across an old violin at a yard sale. One of the four kids happens to play the violin and decides to buy it to add to his collection. As the kids return home to their club house, they are stalked by a man whom they saw at the yard sale. For some reason he is eager to buy the violin (which we later learn is really a fiddle), but the kids resist his generous offers. While examining the violin for clues as to why the man is so interested in it, they discover a treasure map along with a heart shaped key. On the opposite side of the map is poem that seems to hint to where the treasure lies. What does the poem mean, and where is the treasure? Watch, and find out for yourself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109369</url></doc>
