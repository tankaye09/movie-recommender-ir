<plot>"Whacked", a raucous romantic comedy, takes us on a trip through the seedy underbelly of Ruth's fantasy. Ruth is a young married woman who has always fantasized about getting a good hard whack - but she wants to pay for it. She finds Jim, an older jaded man who has been working in the "sex" business for years, and gets him to agree to take her on her carefully scripted journey. However, Jim is transfixed by Ruth's innocence and excitement and it wakes him up to a part of himself that he thought had died long ago. The adventure goes a bit "off script" and Jim eventually gives Ruth even more than she paid for, expected or planned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651377</url></doc>
