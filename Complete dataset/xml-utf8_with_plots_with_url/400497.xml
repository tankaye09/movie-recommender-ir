<plot>Here is shown the elk of North America in all its majesty. The noble-looking animal is well worth seeing, and always attracts a larger percentage of visitors to the pen in which it is enclosed than any other in the Zoo. This film is true to nature, and you imagine you are looking at the real thing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400497</url></doc>
