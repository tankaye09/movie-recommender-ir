<plot>Modern day secular India sees riots break out between extremists elements belonging to Hindu and Muslim groups. To pacify them, Haji Ali Baba appeals to them, and asks them to return peacefully to their homes and families, which they do. This does not auger well with the perpetrators of the riots, who want to destabilize India, take over Kashmir, and infuse terrorism in every walk of life. One of the employees, Raghu, of these instigators finds that his child has been killed, so he makes a file and takes it to Haji, and is killed shortly thereafter. When Haji goes through the file he finds that the conspiracy involves big name politicians, and he decides to confront one of them. He does so, and is killed, but after leaving the file in a secure location. The big-wigs hire two friends, Veeru and Akbar, to locate the file for a fee, which they do. Then they find out that they have virtually turned over the country to extremists, and decide to repent for their actions by recovering the file and handing it to proper authorities for disposal. What they do not realize is that there seems to be no "proper authority" for dealing with such wrong actions, and it appears that everyone is involved in this deep conspiracy to make money for themselves. The two hapless friends now realize the situation they are in, and must prepare themselves and their loved ones against the onslaught that will surely wipe them out from this world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068017</url></doc>
