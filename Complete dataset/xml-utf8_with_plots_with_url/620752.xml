<plot>Tulip Time is a profile of Trio Lescano, a musical group of Dutch Jewish sisters who were stylistically similar to the Andrews Sisters. The three Lescanos were enormously popular in Italy in the 1930s and 1940s. Their career took off in 1938 with the songs "Anna" and "Tulip Time". Sandra, Giuditta, and Caterinetta, daughters of Hungarian circus artist Alexander and Dutch operetta singer Eva Leschan, grew up in Holland but performed widely. They were discovered by Italian impresario Carlo Prato, who changed their name to Lescano. Their meteoric rise was simultaneous to the ascent of the fascist regime. Ultimately their recording contract was cancelled in 1943 because their songs were declared anti-Fascist. They were arrested and held in custody for weeks. Marco De Stefanis and Tonino Boniotti's first-rate documentary features rare found footage from the Fascist period in Italy and entertaining film sequences of these unique performers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?620752</url></doc>
