<plot>Fifteenth century England saw the turmoil of a bloody struggle for power between the House of York and the House of Lancaster. The Wars of The Roses would culminate in a ferocious encounter on Bosworth Field in 1485 - a battle which saw the death of King Richard III. With Henry VII's victory, the Tudor Dynasty was born. This program features battle reconstruction plus computer effects and dramatized re-enactments. The program also combines computer mapping techniques and period imagery to tell the story of the mighty clashes between the White Rose and the Red Rose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363451</url></doc>
