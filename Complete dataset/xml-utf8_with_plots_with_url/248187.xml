<plot>We meet a young couple as they find a new home to share together. Things are rosey, and our ever-optimistic boyfriend (after noticing the dimmer switch) gives the new place his signature tick of approval. "Ten out of ten." You see, things are pretty simple for our loveable rogue. He sees something he likes, and gives it a mark out of ten. Invariably a ten out of ten. And things are pretty simple for his girlfriend too. All she has to do is put up with a bloke who gives his poos a score. A young happy couple with nothing more to get in their way than a really bloody annoying habit. Sound familiar? "How much do you love me?" - Exploring the notion of unconditional love, patience and wheatgrass smoothies - it's a very unromantic comedy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248187</url></doc>
