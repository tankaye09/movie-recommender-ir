<plot>Isaac Khor Bher was violently driven from his family and village at age six. He made a 1000-mile journey to a refugee camp barefoot. The next fifteen years would be spent in a series of harrowing flights to other crowded camps in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Throughout, Isaac chose to be a student, not a soldier. In the summer of 2005, Isaac became the first Lost Boy of Sudan to be reunited with his family. His mother, unaware that he was alive, embraced him after a twenty-year separation. An eloquent personal account, 'one story' chronicles Isaac Khor Bher's journey of survival, a narrative that transcends his own experiences to bear testament to the desperate struggles of child refugees worldwide.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412666</url></doc>
