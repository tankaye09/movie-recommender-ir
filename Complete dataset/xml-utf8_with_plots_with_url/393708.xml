<plot>How the hell does an unsigned band headline a 7-week tour spanning Japan and Europe? No one's ever heard of it til now. Never Heard of It (NHOI) is far more than a rock band out of Los Angeles, California. NHOI is living proof that ingenuity, dedication and a touch of charm can embrace the modern, global music scene in ways that outmaneuver traditional barriers. Energetic artists who moon-light as crafty hustlers, NHOI has managed to complete 10 US tours including 2 full Vans Warped Tours, headline several tours in Japan, Mexico and throughout Europe, and sell over 100,000 albums all on their own. This DVD provides a back-stage, uncensored view of NHOI's latest trek through Japan, England, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Packed with personal interviews, live performances and goofy foreigners, this journey gets you up close and personal with these rockers and their unique approach. From intimate, amazing on stage footage of the bands live show, to hilarious bonus features, everyone's sure to enjoy the trip.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393708</url></doc>
