<plot>Tom is about to begin the best day of his life. He begins his morning with a mantra, 'I'm a lucky man, and today is my lucky day!' He has a job interview for the perfect job, he has his woman (Janine) sleeping at his side. Tom has it all. But before he even gets out of bed to prep for the beginning of his perfect day, Tom's luck runs on the edge as he takes a beating from an unaware Janine and his morning is turned to chaos before he even leaves the door for his interview. A comedy with slapstick and romance about when things go wrong, THINGS GO WRONG!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082171</url></doc>
