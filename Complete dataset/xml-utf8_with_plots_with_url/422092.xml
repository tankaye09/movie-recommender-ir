<plot>August 1999, The days of the Total Solar Eclipse. A rundown villa on the edge of the sea is transformed into a dogs' home which frequently also provides shelter for chance visitors. The lady who owns it was once a famous opera singer who now shares her loneliness with an old friend. Her extravagant shows are a daily occurrence for the visitors. Every year she plays out her own death like an opera performance, the date of which has been predicted by a famous clairvoyant without specifying the year. Every new visitor becomes unwittingly involved in these performances. One evening, a 20 year-old boy turns up at the home. The singer falls in love with him and tries in every way possible to attract his attention. Her elderly friend tries in Vein to overcome his burning envy. The conflicts between the main characters become more and more cruel while the performances of the singer become madder and madder and more and more humiliating. She drags an elderly tramp that makes a living imitating Charlie Chaplin into her cruel game. The boy who has no idea about the passions he has unleashed is also drawn into the performance. However, he is wounded by events and he tries to find refuge in the drugs and alcohol of his peers who have pitched their tents on the beach. The two elderly inhabitants of the home remain alone, face to face with hatred, love and death. There is only one gesture left - that of friendship towards the dogs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422092</url></doc>
