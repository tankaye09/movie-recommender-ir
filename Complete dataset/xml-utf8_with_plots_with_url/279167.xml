<plot>"Jones' wife has been telling her troubles to his friend, who becomes very loving and affectionate. He abuses Jones' confidence in him and consoles the lady with the most touching sympathy. Just at this point the door opens and Jones appears in his night-gown. He is still in a happy state, but not too much so to appreciate the position. Grasping the false on by the collar, he throws him bodily out of the window; his hat, stick and valise follow. Taking his wife by the arms, he pushes her from the room. Overcome by the excitement and the exertion, he collapses in the middle of the room."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279167</url></doc>
