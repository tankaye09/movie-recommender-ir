<plot>"L'Aspect rose de la chose" was shot in Grenoble in 1980. It is one of the few openly political films on homosexuality in France. By offering a collective description of members of the G.L.H. (Homosexual Liberation Group) the films raises issues such as being in a relationship, ghettos, sisterhood, militancy, working-class gays and lesbians, or growing old. It also shows what Grenoble was like back then, and how it tried to approach tolerance, borderlines and the struggle for identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?302110</url></doc>
