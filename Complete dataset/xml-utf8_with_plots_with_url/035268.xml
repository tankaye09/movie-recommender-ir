<plot>AMERICAN WAITRESS, new mexico is a documentary feature film that examines the lives, attitudes, perceptions and experiences of waitresses. But it is not just a film about waitresses. It is a film about life, about social structures, about human nature. The film reveals the human side of this service industry through interviews with waitresses, restaurant employees and customers and explores in-depth the personal lives of four of these waitresses. We go home with them and out with them-- to tattoo parlors, bars, motorcycle shops, mountaintops, welding classes and even hunting. American Waitress, new mexico uncovers a very human dimension to these individuals and by inference, to all those among us who while in uniform, practice the art of service with a smile. Will we ever perceive our friendly food server in the same way again? Not likely.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?035268</url></doc>
