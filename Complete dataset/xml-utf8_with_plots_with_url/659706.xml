<plot>Twelve year old Jackie Archer Thinks his life is over when his parents move him from Colorado to a small Texas town in the middle of summer vacation. With little to do except ride his skateboard, Jackie takes off to explore the town where he eventually meets Maggie, a local girl, and learns that there is a murderous psychopath terrorizing the town! Convinced that the creepy old man across the street is a werewolf, Jackie sets off for the adventure of a lifetime with the help of Maggie and their friend Damien in an attempt to uncover the truth. But things are about to get harrier when Jackie discovers that he too has become a werewolf! With a corrupt sheriff after him for a murder he didn't commit, it is up to Jackie and his skateboard to end the curse before it's too late.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659706</url></doc>
