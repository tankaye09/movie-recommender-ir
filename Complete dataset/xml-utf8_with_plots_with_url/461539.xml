<plot>A Long Island man (Joe Marzano) becomes nostalgic as he walks through the area of Brooklyn where he lived as a child. Marzano described this autobiographical film short as "a poignant visit to an old neighborhood. Old sounds, songs." A few months after it was filmed, he incorporated it into his _Trilogy (1961)_ (qv), and the plot situation is echoed in Marzano's final film, _Stranger in Town, A (2000)_ (qv), thus completing the circle of Marzano's life in cinema.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461539</url></doc>
