<plot>Based on the popular cartoon of the same name, Extreme Ghostbusters: Code Ecto-1 has Eduardo Rivera and Kylie Griffin on a quest to rescue their kidnapped teammates from the half-human, half-demon Count Mercharior. The young duo must explore 12 massive levels in four enormous worlds to find the clues needed to locate their missing friends. Each new area begins with an overhead race through New York City in the Ecto-1 ambulance. Players must reach the haunted location within a given time limit. Skilled drivers can pick up time bonus icons along the way. Each area has a formidable end boss that must be defeated before moving on. Players must use both of the heroes' strengths to defeat bosses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186211</url></doc>
