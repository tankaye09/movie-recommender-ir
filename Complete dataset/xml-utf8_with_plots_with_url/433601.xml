<plot>Caught by the Piutes, pony Express Rider Dick Carter falls in love with pretty Dorothy Earle, who belongs to that seemingly endless supply of white girls kidnapped in childhood and raised by Indians. Unfortunately, Dorothy is promised to Bud Osborne, described in a title as "a renegade white who dominates the simple minds of the savage horde." Does Dorothy succeed in taking her own life rather than face an uncertain future with evil Bud? Or does the stalwart Dick rescue her in time?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433601</url></doc>
