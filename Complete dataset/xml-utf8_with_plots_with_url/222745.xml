<plot>Since the 1860s, Cubans have lovingly played baseball, a game that represented independence and modernity. Both Cuba and the U.S. embraced the game, but in distinct ways. Set against the back-drop of the choppy history of U.S.-Cuban relations, Greener Grass documents how both countries have used baseball as a political tool and how the sport has operated as both a bridge and barrier between the two lands. The film features interviews with current and former baseball players in both countries, media commentators and baseball historians on both sides of the straits of Florida. Greener Grass is a provocative look at the ironies and complexities that emerge when two nations share one pastime.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222745</url></doc>
