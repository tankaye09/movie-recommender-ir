<plot>Rahul is the only child of a wealthy family in the toy manufacturing business, consisting of his dad, Raj, and mom, Urmila. He attends college, meets with Neha and both fall in love, get very intimate so much so that Neha gets pregnant. He then takes Neha to introduce her to his parents, who initially approve of her, but after finding out that her parents are Akansha and Tarun Awasthi, they instruct Rahul to take Neha home, and later ask him not to see Neha again. Rahul will soon find out that the young woman he has impregnated could well be his very own sister, mainly due to the (un)doing of their respective parents years ago. Watch how the two families deal with this new crisis and the impact this will have on Neha and Rahul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273580</url></doc>
