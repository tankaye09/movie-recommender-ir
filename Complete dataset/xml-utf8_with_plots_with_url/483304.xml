<plot>Jake lives a life of routine. Everyday he is haunted by disappointment in unachievable dreams and missed opportunities. In the midst of the Christmas season, the emotions he used to push aside are wearing on him. Colorful, fresh, happy, childhood Christmas memories arise around every corner, only to remind him of the joy and hope he has lost. Jake does everything he can to just get past Christmas and avoid the memories. His memories bring up frustration, and in the process he ignores the loving acts of his wife to cheer him up. When he wakes up on Christmas morning, only start his normal routine again, he receives an unexpected wake up call. Jake chooses to try and right the wrongs of his recent actions. He gives Christmas a second chance, and in turn himself a fresh start.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?483304</url></doc>
