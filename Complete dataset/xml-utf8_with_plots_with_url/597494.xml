<plot>A documentary filmed at Moton Field in Tuskegee Alabama, home to the airmen of the 99th Fighter Squadron. They were the first African American fighter pilots trained to fly in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. Nearly 1,000 pilots trained in Tuskegee and about half of those saw combat, destroying or damaging about 400 enemy aircraft, but found themselves fighting two wars-- the one against fascism abroad, and the one against racism at home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597494</url></doc>
