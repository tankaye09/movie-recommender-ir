<plot>The Hunters Excited to start his annual weekend hunting trip with the guys, Charlie stops to pick up his 14-year old son from his ex-wife's house. He's annoyed to find Danni, his 12-year old daughter eagerly waiting to step in to take her ill brother's place on the trip. Although she realizes her dad doesn't want to take her, Danni holds firm. As the trip unfolds, Danni struggles to be accepted into the male-dominated world of hunting, a thoughtless act of cowardice becomes the key to unlocking Danni's relationship with her dad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?565777</url></doc>
