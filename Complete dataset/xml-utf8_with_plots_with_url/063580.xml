<plot>Jeff Scott finds himself constantly dreaming of the night he killed his wife; or at least that's what he convinces himself to believe. But the fact is that he was in a car accident that only he survived; leaving his wife dead. He seeks the aid of a hypnotist to help him find clarity. But instead, the process awakes memories and moments he and his wife once shared, and he becomes obsessed with the hypnotic process. Caught in the web of confusion he's forced to make a decision on whether to live or die; as obsession, suicide and life hang in the balance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063580</url></doc>
