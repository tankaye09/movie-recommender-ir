<plot>A stop-motion animated grasshopper named R.B. Bugg works as a reporter who gathers information for live-action news anchorwoman Red Green at TV station WORD. With each report submitted, lessons on grammar and sentence structure are taught as R.B. Bugg edits his writing with Red's help. Each episode includes a segment in which the grasshopper sings "Palabra Jot, Palabra Jot, Write a Little, Write a Lot," to encourage children viewing the show to do their own writing. The end of every show finds R.B. Bugg fallen asleep in front of a TV set on which the U.S. National Anthem plays as the flag is lowered, followed by static as the station goes off the air for the evening.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602500</url></doc>
