<plot>As he dies from the wounds received from the Morrow outlaw gang, the sheriff (Pierce Lyden) of King City, Texas hands his badge to his deputy, Tod Merrick (James Ellison as Jimmy Ellison). In the Morrow gang are Bart Morrow (I. Stanford Jolley), his son Steve (Lee Roberts) and Ed Mason (Terry Frost). Texas Ranger Johnny Mack Brown (Johnny Mack Brown) is assigned to the case. Johnny meets Tod who is also visited by Bart, who is his father, who once forced Tod to help in a bank robbery before Tod left and tried to make a new life under an assumed name. Johnny and another Ranger hold off an attempt by the Morrow gang to rob a stagecoach, and Johnny becomes convinced that Tod is giving the gang inside information. But when Tod is seriously wounded trying to arrest Bart, Steve and Ed, learns otherwise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536838</url></doc>
