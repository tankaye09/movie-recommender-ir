<plot>A struggling painter in a crumbling marriage seeks refuge in his work and cheap beer. Disgusted with him, his wife suddenly leaves, forcing him to go looking for her. His desperate search becomes strangely surreal after a little absinthe and marijuana are thrown into the mix. During his quest, he plumbs the depths of his feelings for her, discovering how much she means to him, but fears that his epiphany may have come too late. "Splitsville" is a black comedy presented with fresh wit in a unique style that incorporates the art and animation of acclaimed painter David Schwartz.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510936</url></doc>
