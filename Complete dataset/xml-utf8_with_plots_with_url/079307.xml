<plot>The Thomsons - parents Thomas and Francie, and children Willa, Arthur, Beatrice (nicknamed Booky) and Jakey - are a loving working class family living in Depression era Toronto. In the lead up to Christmas, Thomas loses his job as a harness maker for the Eaton's company as the company is moving into the motorized age in an effort to keep up with the times; Eaton's is facing as challenging a time as any business during the Depression. Thomas' job prospects in this changing time are not good. Ironically, Eaton's has a Christmas Fund where each child in the city whose father is not working is eligible for a Christmas gift from the company. Because of the Thomson's new situation, Booky risks losing her best friend Laura Westover, whose snobbish and social climbing mother wants her daughter to associate with a higher class of friend. By happenstance, Booky befriends Mr. Eaton, the owner of the Eaton company. Because of circumstances, Booky, who knows Mr. Eaton was the Eaton's Christmas parade Santa Claus, believes he really is her Secret Santa. Booky is granted a wish by her Secret Santa, Booky whose selfless request is rewarded several times over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?079307</url></doc>
