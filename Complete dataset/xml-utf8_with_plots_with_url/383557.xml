<plot>One in four people in Britain suffers from mental illness at some point in their lives. The consequences can be devastating but what is it like growing up in a family when one of your parents has a mental illness? My Crazy Parents follows three families, all of whom have a mum or a dad with a long history of mental health problems, including psychotic depression and hearing voices. Often through the eyes of the children themselves, we see how family life is affected and how children cope with traumatic situations. What is it like to have your parent overdose or repeatedly self-harm? And how does it feel to be repeatedly taken into care? My Crazy Parents is deeply moving and shocking in its honesty. For this intimate series we filmed with each family over a six-month period. The families also filmed themselves and made extraordinary video diaries recording their thoughts and experiences.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383557</url></doc>
