<plot>Cape Town, South Africa - 1994: While the world cheered Nelson Mandela's victory in South Africa's first multiracial election, unpredicted and underreported was the ANC's overwhelming defeat in the province of the Western Cape. Fueled by the votes of so-called "Coloureds" -- a racial classification from the Apartheid years -- and some clever, yet racist campaigning, FW de Klerk's National Party won a surprise victory. Filmed in Cape Town during the campaign, "Cape Divided" examines how the National Party -- which was responsible for the oppression of Apartheid -- could have won the election in a region where whites do not hold the majority. With a dramatic and innovative visual style, the documentary also takes an investigative look at South Africa's future, with a focus on ethnic conflict and poverty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?093327</url></doc>
