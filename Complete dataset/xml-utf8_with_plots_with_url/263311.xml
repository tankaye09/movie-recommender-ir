<plot>Two men find themselves reevaluating a long-standing relationship in the early hours of the morning. The older man - a professor, a writer, a recovering alcoholic - has become even more distant and cold over the years. The younger man - a former student and aspiring writer - feels increasingly alienated. This intense film explores the issues of older and younger, powerful and average, and the feelings of isolation when a relationship grows stale.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?263311</url></doc>
