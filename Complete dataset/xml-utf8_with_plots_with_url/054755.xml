<plot>This film represents the baby show on the Boardwalk and is very interesting, in that you can see all styles, shapes and sizes of the proverbial "squalling kids." One tot falls overboard, but is immediately rescued by one of the crowd who dive after it. A very fine picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054755</url></doc>
