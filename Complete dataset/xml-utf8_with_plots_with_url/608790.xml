<plot>Timor Tour of Duty is an Australian made war documentary film giving a raw and first hand account of Australian soldiers under fire in East Timor in 2001 and the trauma they later suffered. But it is a universal story of humans and the side effects of war. Deliberately shot in hand-held camcorder home video style and seamlessly interwoven with soldiers' actual footage, never before seen photographs and reconstructed scenes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608790</url></doc>
