<plot>The story of Donald Campbell's record attempt in which he was killed; and of his earlier attempts on the world water and land speed records in the legendary "Bluebird" machines. The film was shot during the last months of 1966 and early 1967 when Campbell was at Coniston Water with high hopes of attaining the goal that was so important to him - to break the 'magic' 300 mph mark.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583882</url></doc>
