<plot>A small town in rural India is being terrorized by wild animals, and bandits. No one is able to stop them from killing and looting the residents. The only one who was able to stand against the bandits was master Dina Nath, but he was arrested and is imprisoned. When Dina Nath returns home, he befriends a young man by the name of Shiva, and asks him to protect this town. Subsequently, Dina Nath is killed. Shiva is blamed for Dina Nath's death by the townspeople, severely beaten, and left for dead. But some compassionate townspeople rescue him as they think he is Lord Shiva reincarnated to save their town. They do not know that Shiva is an escaped convict, and by playing God to the simple-minded townspeople, he is merely whiling for time, so that he can carry out his very own secret agenda.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162436</url></doc>
