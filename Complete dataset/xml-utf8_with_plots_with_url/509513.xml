<plot>An unusual destiny of man named Deva who lost his mind while grazing camels in the desert of northwestern India. He was tied to the only tree in his village for years. Deva's wife left him, meanwhile his mother looked after him. Till one day, a massive earthquake erased the region. The disaster killed thousands and made millions homeless but Deva found his mind, his sanity, and his life -again. Natasha De Betak passionately followed Deva and his story over five years of filming. Today Deva stands at the crossroad -which world to choose that of sane people or that of insane.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509513</url></doc>
