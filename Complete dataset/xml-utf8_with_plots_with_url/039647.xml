<plot>An off-screen narrator introduces us to Andy, a three-and-a-half year old orangutan that lives at the Bronx Zoo. We see at least one animal for each letter of the alphabet; almost all are filmed at the zoo. Aided by a male keeper, Andy visits a few: riding on a camel and a tortoise, feeding an apple to a rhino, and watching lions; or, a few animals visit him. He's wary of a skunk and a frog. The narrator provides a few facts: where an animal is from, what it eats, or some distinguishing feature and talent. A few letters of the alphabet get more than one animal. The soundtrack begins and ends with children singing their A B C's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039647</url></doc>
