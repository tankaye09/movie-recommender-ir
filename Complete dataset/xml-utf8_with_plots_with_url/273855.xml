<plot>This Rajput romance is about Commander Ambar of Ajaygarh who triumphs over neighbouring Ramgarh capturing its king and the beautiful Princess Rama (Gulab). Ambar falls for her but problems arise when the king of Ajaygarh wants to give his own daughter in marriage to the victorious commander. Ambar covertly helps Rama and her father escape but he is killed in the process and dies in Rama's arms. The major portion of the film deals with Ambar's imprisonment at the hands of his own patron, remaining seven days without food. Highlights include spectacular battle scenes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273855</url></doc>
