<plot>This impressive ceremony is performed in the order as officially published. Their Majesties, Royalty, Clergy, and other Distinguished Personages taking part in the Coronation are impersonated by accomplished actors and actresses, every detail as to costumes, robes, regalia, coronation chairs, chair of state, Abbey arrangements, etc., being as faithfully reproduced as possible, in order to convey the scene to the millions who are not privileged to witness the actual proceedings. Only such portions of the ceremony as would admit of action have been selected for purposes of this representation, thus greatly reducing the duration of the actual performance, and blending the same into a consecutive series, enacted in the most impressive and dignified manner, and in the following order, viz: 1. His Majesty taking the oath. 2. King Edward kissing the book and signing the oath. 3. The annointing 4. The oblation of the sword. 5. The imperial mantle 6. The orb and sceptres. 7. The crowning of his Majesty in St. Edward's Chair. 8. The King and Queen ascend to the chairs of state.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550242</url></doc>
