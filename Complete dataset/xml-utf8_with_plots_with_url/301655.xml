<plot>The story of Dynasty, a ballerina whose dream was to become famous at the local Vaudeville theater. Unfortunately, she slipped further and further away from reality. Now Dynasty is desperately searching for a new role both in her real life and as an actress. Haunted by her own nightmares and fantasies, there is only one frightening option left: the notorious Pygor and his outdated L'amour Toujours Theatre. After reading an ad placed by Pygor in the local newspaper, Dynasty is confronted by Pygor and his 'freak cabaret' and is about to face what will turn out to be the audition from hell. This film is about anarchism and tyranny, big moustaches and trashy track suits, cocktail parties and terrorism, French cheese and pantomime, new abstract realities and claustrophobic mazes. It is about Princess Stephanie of Monaco and Noam Chomsky. It is a film about nothing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?301655</url></doc>
