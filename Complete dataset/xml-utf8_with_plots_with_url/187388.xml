<plot>Filmmaker Mitch Gavin documents artist Ricardo Aguilar as he spreads creativity throughout Southern California. "Galleries are too slow and too few," says Ricardo, which is why he decided to take art to the people. He shows up at festivals, art shows and any place else where something interesting is happening. He gets the people involved personally, by having them color his Faces of Hope. In doing so, he has united all walks of life and thanks to the film festival circuit: North Carolina, Washington DC and Milan Italy as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187388</url></doc>
