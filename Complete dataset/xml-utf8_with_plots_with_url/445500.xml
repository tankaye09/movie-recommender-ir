<plot>This scene was taken on the outskirts of Pekin, China, and shows a number of Chinamen passing in a procession. The expressions on the faces of some of them as they turn around to look at the camera are very funny. At times, it is with great difficulty that the leaders of the procession can keep the throng moving.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445500</url></doc>
