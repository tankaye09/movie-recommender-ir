When Kunverji looks into this further, he finds that both he and Reshma are lovers from a past birth, and they were fated to meet in this birth, as they were unable to wed each other in the last birth. This fascinates both of them, however, Reshma's and Kunverji's dads are furious at this, and attempt to make sure that the two are separated.
