<plot>When they're not busy picking our pockets, or telling us we have to give up liberties to have freedom, they're selling us garbage and calling it food. The manufactured food business is bigger than Big Oil; that kind of money buys inconceivably large amounts of propaganda, misinformation and corrupted science. Processed People is a wake-up call with factual, hard-hitting health commentary that is rarely heard. If you're searching for the un-processed truth about diet and health, look no further.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445481</url></doc>
