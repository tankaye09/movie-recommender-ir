<plot>Chronicles the misadventures of four friends as they make their way thorough today's slightly askew dating scene. Tom, the voice of the group, finds himself dumped by his girl and fired by his job. He has to make the choice to either sit around and mope forever, or to get on with life. Mike, the moral center of the gang, is about to get married. He finds himself asking if he really wants to do this, or has he just convinced himself he should? Clyde, the ladies' man of the four, meets a woman he cannot easily seduce. How far is he willing to bend the truth to get what he wants? Jerry, who's never been popular with women, finds himself caught between two of them. He also finds himself skirting the border of propriety, legality, and common decency. LIARS, a Romantic Comedy about how modern men lie to others - and to themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?334530</url></doc>
