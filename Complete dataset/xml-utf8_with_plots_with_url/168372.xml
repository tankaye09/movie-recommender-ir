<plot>Lalchand Dogra lives in a palatial house with his wife, Anjana, and three sons, Sunny, Raj, and Jay. Due to circumstances beyond their control, all get separated, with Lalchand himself ending up serving time in prison for several years. Years later, Lalchand is released from jail and sets out to find his family and try to put the rest of his life together. What he does not know that Jay has been adopted by the Commissioner of Police, Paramjeet Singh, and is currently looking at ways to get Lalchand back in prison; Sunny has been hired as his bodyguard; and Raj has just received a contract to kill Lalchand at any cost. It looks like the Dogra family is headed for another separation - this time permanent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168372</url></doc>
