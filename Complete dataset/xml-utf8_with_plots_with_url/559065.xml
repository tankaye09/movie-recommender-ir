<plot>The anticipation of a great day's sport is very evident by the interest taken alike by horses and hounds in the early part of this picture. As they start forth from the kennels, expectation is apparent in every motion. The vaulting of the steeds over bars and the loping of hounds as they start tend at once to interest all in the exciting chase for the brush that must occur later on.
