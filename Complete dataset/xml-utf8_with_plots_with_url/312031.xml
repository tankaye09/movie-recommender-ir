<plot>A factory siren sounds, workers punch in, the machinery starts. A worker opens small bags under a spout that spews beans into the bag. The worker must open a new bag quickly before the spout dispenses more beans. He sets each full bag on a rack; another worker seals the bags. When the worker loses his rhythm and gets the bags late to the spout, beans pile up around him. His boss hollers. Cut to his flat where his aproned wife cooks dinner as their daughter plays. He storms in, snarls at the cooking food, and stomps out. Mom snivels, then trips on a toy, so the kid gets yelled at. The child kicks the dog who worries the cat who pounces.... The factory siren sounds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?312031</url></doc>
