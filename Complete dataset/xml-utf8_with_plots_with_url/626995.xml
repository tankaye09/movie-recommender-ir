<plot>The service-station attendant Giuseppe lives in Rome when he receives an invitation from his father to visit him in America. There Giuseppe finds out he has to take part in a television program to win $10,000. Afterwards he follows his father through The States in search of money and success, pursued by the criminals his father was in debt to. Giuseppe discovers that his father lives by his own wits and has no money at all. When his father is arrested because of fraud, the only thing Giuseppe can do is to take his old job as a service-station attendant, this time in America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?626995</url></doc>
