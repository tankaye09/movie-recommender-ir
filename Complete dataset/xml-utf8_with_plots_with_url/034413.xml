<plot>Lasting for about two and a half years, this travel documentary enjoyed an on-and-off run at various positions in the ABC evening lineup. For Americans, it is possible to travel to an amazing variety of locations without ever leaving the country, and this travelogue presented viewers with a look at some of the more interesting or unusual places to go. Locations included, among many other locales, the natural wonders of Yellowstone and Hawaii, and the urban variety of New York and San Francisco.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034413</url></doc>
