<plot>During the past few years coffee prices have dramatically dropped due to unjust pricing. Because of eroding urban economies like that of Salvador Urbina, Chiapas, Mexico, many Mexicans have left their homelands fleeing to northern Mexico and the United States in search for better economic opportunities. The goal of this documentary film is to illustrate the simple, yet creative solutions which can help alleviate illegal immigration in the United States. The company Just Coffee, with the support of residents of Tucson and Douglas, Arizona, have created a coffee cooperative that offers more than mere coffee, but a way of life for Mexican natives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282203</url></doc>
