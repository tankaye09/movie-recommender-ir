<plot>This half-hour reality show is based on the life Ky-Mani Marley, Bob Marley's sixth son. Being known as the "wild one" has put Ky-Mani in a category of his own. His American influence and love of hip hop have crossed him over into popular culture and allowed him to star in movies such as Shottas (2006), Haven (2004) and One Love (2003). Cameras will follow Ky-Mani on his accelerated ride to fame as he records his new album, Radio and preps for his three-month tour with legendary rock band, Van Halen. This is no ordinary Marley. You will see a flamboyance and tenacity unlike you've ever seen from any of his siblings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339323</url></doc>
