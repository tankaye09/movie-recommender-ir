<plot>In 1909, the New South Wales Aborigines Protection Board planned to break up Aboriginal communities by forcibly removing children and hiring them out as servants to white 'masters'. The children were paid sixpence for their services, but many never saw their 'lousy little sixpence'. In the 1930s, Aboriginal people began to organize and to fight the Aborigines Protection Board. Through old film footage, photographs and the memories of Aboriginal elders, we are presented with an account of their lives and their struggle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344250</url></doc>
