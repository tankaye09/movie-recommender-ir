But Rajoo's dad vehemently opposes this marriage, and refuses to accept Sheetal. Then Rajoo is accidentally killed in a vehicle accident, leaving Sheetal pregnant and totally devastated. She eventually gives birth a baby boy Deepu (Master Alankar). Sheetal than seeks employment, and gets a job as a teacher. One of her students is a child named Muni, whose dad is a widower, Ravi (Shammi Kapoor). Since their circumstances are similiar, they become very close, and eventually decide to marry. But Ravi's mom )Achla Sachdev) objects to this marriage, and accuses Sheetal of being a woman of questionable means.
