<plot>A party of Chinese soldiers appear leading a prisoner with his arms bound behind him. They unbind him and he is placed in a pillory. A number of men pass who tease him unmercifully. Finally the soldiers return, and take him back to jail. Very good.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?444350</url></doc>
