<plot>Invitation follows one night in the life of three roommates, Dan, Balazs and Stefan, as they host a house party. Stefan, a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser, doesn't want the party to happen but is quickly suckered into participating. When Anais, Stefan's girlfriend, doesn't show up at the party, he goes on a quest to find her. Balazs the youngest of the three roommates, is cornered to pay up on a debt by the end of the night. Desperate for cash, he attempts begging his friends and lovers, finally offering to publicly humiliate himself for the cash. Dan is seemingly the most centered of the three but it is evident that he harbors hostility towards his bohemian sister, Amy. The more drunk and flirtatious Amy gets, the more agitated Dan becomes. He eventually confronts Amy about his worst suspicion - that Amy had an affair with his fiancée. Invitation is a voyeuristic glimpse into the experiences of three roommates as they struggle to maintain control of their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268062</url></doc>
