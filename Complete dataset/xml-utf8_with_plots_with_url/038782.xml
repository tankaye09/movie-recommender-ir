<plot>We all remember the first time we fell in love, our first kiss. Or do we? What if things didn't exactly happen the way we remember. Shima was from a traditional, noble family. Nikko was from a new generation, and was leaving for America. Their summer together was coming to a close but their paths had guided them to this moment. Would she get the courage to tell him how she feels? Would he find the courage to kiss her? What happens next would crush them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038782</url></doc>
