<plot>Our hero is the town's photographer and its sheriff. He' in love with a young woman who's also pursued by the older, more devious Dudley Somerset. First our hero must do a few heroic things, saving the lass from danger. He must also not move too quickly on the romantic front. Once she's willing to marry him, he must balance the duties of groom with that of sheriff, while Dudley tries to convince the lass that our hero is untrue to her. Once all is straightened out, the hero makes peace by inviting her family to a photo shoot. Her little brother wrecks havoc.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?502496</url></doc>
