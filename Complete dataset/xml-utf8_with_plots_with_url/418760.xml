<plot>We have just received from our operators accompanying President Roosevelt on his great tour of the Pacific Coast, a splendid series of films covering his reception in San Francisco. The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 1. An automobile ride down San Francisco's busy Market Street, showing the elaborate decorations, crowds of people, traffic, etc. A very novel and effective picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418760</url></doc>
