<plot>Set against the backdrop of a run-down Jersey shore town, Flesh Wounds follows three people with few opportunities and even less sense. When her occasional boyfriend Mark isn't around, Kelly's been distracting herself with Mark's brother Eddie - an aimless, jobless, and ultimately harmless punk who fancies himself a dangerous rebel. This situation plays out to its logical end, and sparks a violent confrontation between the three. Two days later, Eddie, like some ridiculous combination of 70s drive-in anti-hero and Springsteen song protagonist, drives through his small hometown, looking for his brother Mark, revenge on his mind. Kelly tags along, trying to keep Eddie both out of trouble and out of danger. Armed with as much grim determination as he can manage, Eddie will have his vengeance - if he can ever find his target. During the course of one long night, the three will discover that things aren't always as dire as one might want them to be, and that while life may indeed imitate art, it doesn't always do a very good job of it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197393</url></doc>
