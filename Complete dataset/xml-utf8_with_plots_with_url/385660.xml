<plot>Myth of Dreams explores the myriad of reasons for people to immigrate to Hong Kong and captures the luxuries and spoils of such decisions. Many relocate to the former British colony in search of opulence; however, find themselves further impoverished both financially and emotionally. While others make the move with greatest ease and comfort. This dichotomy is exposed visually as the viewer is able to see that the struggle is not an issue of race, but rather of class. Myth of Dreams will expose the fallacy of promises, the triumphs of freedom and the eternal human search for the coveted prosperous life. In the summer of 2007, filmmaker Tony Lau returns to his native land of Hong Kong to see the landscape has changed. Many people have flocked to Hong Kong in search of a better life, however, have found the same stresses that pushed them away from their native land has followed them to Hong Kong. From an old, Chinese fruit packer to a successful Malaysian businessman, Lau captures the story of the immigrants and adequately contrasts their struggles with the success stories. Furthermore, he exploits the differing views on the advantages and disadvantages of coming to Hong Kong.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385660</url></doc>
