<plot>The prophecies of Michel de Nostradame have provoked controversy for more than 400 years. This is the story of his extraordinary life and an exploration of the predictions which, incredibly, appear to have come true. In light of these facts, can we afford to disbelieve? This program combines specially - commissioned dramatized episodes from the life of Nostradamus and classic period images to provide a portrait of the man and his work. It also features commentary and analysis by author and historian Dr. Les Prince of the University of Birmingham.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?594382</url></doc>
