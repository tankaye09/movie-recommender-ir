<plot>Life in the fast lane is full of challenges for anyone who enters the raceway of life. When Ami, Brillante and Camarada start a fashion shop to sell their own clothing and jewelry designs the struggles sometimes seem bigger than they are. Berg, Hermano and Little Man also find out there's more to opening their tuner garage where they hot rod and trick-out cars than they first thought. Not to be discouraged by the hard work ahead of them, the Cool Rules Crew works together to help each other shift into high gear for a trip down victory lane. Driving the coolest cars around, they have a blast everywhere they go all the while building the most successful shops in town.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115155</url></doc>
