<plot>A vaudeville routine: two denizens of the Bowery dance while under the influence. She's wearing a light dress with a full skirt. He wears a white sport coat and tie. Both have hats. On a small stage, she approaches him gingerly, leaning forward. He grabs her close, she leans into him, and he waltzes her around. In her alcohol-induced haze, she hasn't much animation. He wheels her around, his leg behind hers so he can dip her off balance. Back upright, he lets her go and she stands leaning forward; he leans into her and the wobbly movement continues. They stand apart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080864</url></doc>
