<plot>It's the 1930s and a carnival unlike anyone has seen has come to town. This is the story of Catherine, a 14 year-old girl, trapped in the surreal and distorted world of the carnival where she has grown up as a puppet. She is the sole, female lead of an act led by sinister magician, Rambouillette, who is accompanied by Marigold, a dark and ominous clown who masks his pain, and Ambrose, a mute dwarf with a visceral love for her. Merely an emotional marionette to the manipulative Rambouillette and Marigold, Catherine's only outlet is her secret friendship with Ambrose. In front of the curtain, Catherine is an angelic, porcelain doll, yet behind it, she is a pale and pained soul, desperately yearning freedom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393351</url></doc>
