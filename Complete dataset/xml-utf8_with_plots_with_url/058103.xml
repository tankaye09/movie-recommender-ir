<plot>"Dawn Herbert feels she knows where she is going in life: she is about to graduate from Mt. Bishop University, she finds creative expression through her photography and writing, and she is in love. But then her world falls apart and she is forced to reassess her definition of love, marriage and her life's journey. Dawn's coming of age- her finding of her identity and her core self-means she must shed her idealistic perspective of life, of her future, and of her boyfriend as the knight in shining armor. As events unfold, Dawn learns about love by realizing what she does not want in a relationship. She does not want a lie- an illusion. She realizes that she does not want a marriage like her mother's, and she does not want to become a prisoner like the University parkkeeper's wife. Instead, Dawn learns that she has a choice. Fate is only what life offers, while destiny is what she will make of herself. Dawn summons the strength to take action, and she chooses her destiny."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058103</url></doc>
