<plot>Eighteen-year-old Sam Barley is an All-American high school quarterback who lives and breathes football. Just days away from committing to Notre Dame University to fulfill his dream of becoming a college football star, America is struck by the tragedy of Sept. 11 and Sam's life is forever changed. "A Hero's Heart" is the story of a young man's courage to sacrifice his future (and possibly his life) for a greater cause, and a father who is willing to stop at nothing to prevent him from altering his destiny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011478</url></doc>
