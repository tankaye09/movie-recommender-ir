<plot>This is a doctor's office, wherein is seen the doctor and two of his servants. While the doctor leaves the room, one of the servants dons his coat and as a boy patient enters, he prescribes for him as well as for a lady and gentleman. A man comes in with a broken leg and the would-be doctor takes away his crutch and kicks him on the game leg. The patient protests and the quack turns a seltzer bottle on him, and as the doctor enters, he receives the full contents of the bottle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153675</url></doc>
