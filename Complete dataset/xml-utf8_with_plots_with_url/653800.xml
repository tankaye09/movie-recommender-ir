<plot>As Operation Iraqi Freedom enters its 6th year, the domestic legacy is now the return home for those who have been injured during their service. Where Life Is follows three severely injured veterans pursuing sport as a means of rehabilitation and readjustment to civilian life. The film follows these veterans, as they face the realities of making the Paralympics. They swim in the ocean and ride a bicycle again for the first time, as well as face their demons and moments of despair. This is a privileged look into their lives - a portrait of their courage to overcome their injuries with the help of friends, family, and sport.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653800</url></doc>
