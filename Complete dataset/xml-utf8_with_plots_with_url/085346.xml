<plot>Buck's recollections are foggy and muddled. It may have only been a tv show, or he may have actually floated through his roof, into space and beyond. He may have landed on a strange red planet and joined a civilization, only to topple it with his carelessness. He may have expanded to proportions so dizzying that he himself became the big bang shedding light on all existence. Having done all that or not, Buck's conclusion is that he's no better or worse off sitting at home in his lazy boy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085346</url></doc>
