<plot>Screaming for the world to hear him, James' mind has reached the breaking point and with his last moments darkness stops the light. He journeys into his mind and finds alone the darkness and himself. There is no turning back but with the sharp buzzing sound from the alarm clock. At work he is nothing more then a fly, unnoticed by all. Except for one man, John the office asshole. The only person who will talk to him is the better successful version of James. With his love in the office he couldn't get her to notice him even if he stood to feet from her and screamed her name. Just like that the silence of the city is broken by the sudden appearance of a stranger. The stranger breaks the ice and offers the first words. Before long James is in a one word conversation with the stranger. He is taken and scared by the fact that stranger knows so much about the inner feelings of James; his need for recognition, acceptance, and need attention. Just like that James attempts to leave the stranger but he is brought back by the strangers offer of a gift a gift that would change his life. In a single handshake his life was no longer the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?112963</url></doc>
