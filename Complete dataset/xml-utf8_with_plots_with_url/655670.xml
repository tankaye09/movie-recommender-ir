<plot>Scene in the interior of a Chemical Professor's laboratory. On the shelves are arranged the professor's many bottles of chemicals and experiments. Bridget is sweeping the floor of the laboratory. She suddenly remembers she is very dry, and her attention is attracted to a closet door, over which there is a sign "Spirit Closet." Bridget cautiously looks around, opens the door and takes out a large bottle. After relieving her thirst, she places the bottle back in the closet and leaves the room. The professor enters, goes to the spirit closet for a drink, and discovers the bottle is empty. He decides to check Bridget's appetite for "John Barleycorn." He rigs up a skeleton and a bucket of water in the closet so that the bucket will dump automatically on whoever opens the closet door. The scene then dissolves and shows the laboratory and Bridget entering for another drink. When she opens the closet door, she is clasped around the waist by the skeleton. The water is unceremoniously dumped upon her head, and the skeleton, bearing a sign, "Beware of Rum," pushes her violently to the floor. Bridget is terror-stricken, and from the expression on her face we gather that she desires to give up drinking permanently.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655670</url></doc>
