<plot>Born in Houston, Texas,, in 1905, Hughes was known as a notorious and shrewd business man and a captivation ladies' man. By the time he was 35, he has produced three celebrated movies: Hell's Angeles (1930), Scarface (1932), and The Outlaw (1941), had founded his own aircraft company where he was responsible for designing, building and flying several aircraft, and had broken a number of flight records. Renowned for his shyness and aversion to publicity, Howard Hughes lived the better part of his life as a fashionable daredevil and a man with an eccentric curiosity. With age, however, he began to recede from the public limelight, and eventually locked himself away for the last decades of his life among rumors of mental illness and speculations of extreme paranoia. Filled with rare photographs and images, "Howard Hughes- Aviator, Director, Billionaire" is the biography of a fascinating and enigmatic man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248841</url></doc>
