<plot>There is no documentation that a film of this title was ever produced by Biograph, or written by D.W. Griffith at this time. It is possible that production may have been suspended before completion or else the film may have been released under another completely different title, most possibly When Knights Were Bold (1908) q.v.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652956</url></doc>
