<plot>It's 1949 and detectives Miles Gage and Matt Squire are on their way to their biggest arrest yet-underworld kingpin Eddie Wise. Miles' neighbor Hadley spends evenings smoking in his apartment and trying to convince him to quit the force to write about all the "gunplay and redheads" she's sure make up a detective's existence. When Miles and Squire witness the murder of Wise's only remaining competitor-a slap in the face that occurs in public and on Miles' own street-it's clear the game is about to change. Even Hadley's evening appearances, ostensibly attempts to hide her cigarillo habit from her fiancé, Squire, are more complicated than before. And Eddie Wise seems to have nothing better to do than hang around and heckle Miles about the progress of his investigation. Enter Devon Russell, a survivor of the hit who might have some light to shed... if she chooses to tell what she knows. It's starting to look like Hadley might be right about the gunplay and redheads, and it might just make a good story, if Miles survives it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012488</url></doc>
