<plot>"Midtown"(1998) shot in New York during a single day, in which she brought together sequences which show the streets of midtown Manhattan combining the anonymity of the crowded side-walks with the power of the buildings that frame the everyday movements of the city. Almost a catalogue of peripheral actions, which take place in every film ever made, it explores the narrative possibilities inherent in the simplest actions, and the typical activity of the street. The fragmented narrative emphasise the structure of modern life as well creating a space in which theviewer takes an extremely active role.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?369125</url></doc>
