<plot>When the picture opens, a Physician is seen bending over a little girl lying in bed, apparently dying. After leaving instructions with the mother, he departs, after which the child sees a vision which is in view of the audience, showing an Angel who appears in a mist and hovers over the child. The Angel finally disappears and the child jumps from her cot restored to health.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008473</url></doc>
