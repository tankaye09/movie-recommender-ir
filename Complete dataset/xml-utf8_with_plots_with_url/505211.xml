<plot>Barstow Gibson, an overworked Production Manager for Pelican Isle eMedia, (also known as P.I.E. by employees &amp; competitors), starts his morning on an off note. Two corporate vice-presidents, charged with restructuring the company by the CEO, are waiting by the main elevators as Barstow struggles to round up his staff. Then he realizes that he forgot to reserve the conference room - a major corporate faux pas. Barstow gathers a couple of his direct reports as well as a fellow manager to help him combat the waiting VP's. Finally, the group assembled, Barstow sets out to find an alternate conference room, but is thwarted, when he finds each room to be occupied in strange ways. Barstow and staff, embarrassed by the failure to find a room, and the now-frustrated VP's end up in the dreaded 'empty room by the server room', a hole-in-wall filled with odd items and dilapidated fixtures. Lulled almost to sleep by the droning voice of a VP, Barstow and his staff experiences strange visions of themselves. Then, after the VP's expel his staff, Barstow's worst fears are revealed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?505211</url></doc>
