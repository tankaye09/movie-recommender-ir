<plot>A 'typical American family' emerges in the 50s, grows together in the 60s, falls apart in the 70s, and finally, the remnants of the family comes to terms with their past. Using a unique family archive of 8mm-movie footage compiled from 1945 to1975, a record of this particular family narrative has been created and "folded back on itself" by the addition of contemporary audio interviews with family members. The intersection of these 'public' images with spoken private recollections of the past create another opportunity for insight, both for the viewer and the viewed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?028996</url></doc>
