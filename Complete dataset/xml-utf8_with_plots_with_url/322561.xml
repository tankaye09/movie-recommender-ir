<plot>This is an illusion. A man of huge proportions is seated in a high-back armchair and is turning over in his mind what he will do to amuse himself. Rising and placing himself behind the chair, he produces from a cloth held in his hand two figures, a man and a woman, each one a tiny dwarf, who proceed to do a cakewalk. He changes to another couple, after which he produces a counterpart of himself out of a white pasteboard box, shows how a cakewalk should be danced and disappears. Very good, indeed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?322561</url></doc>
