<plot>After a life of hard knocks and wrong turns, boxer Ed Jones gets a second chance at fulfilling his life long dream of a World Boxing Championship. With the help of veteran promoter, Arliss King and the guidance of a former champ, Ed embarks on the come back of a lifetime. When Ed starts winning and with his popularity soaring, he draws the attention of an unscrupulous fight promoter, White Ferguson. Although tempted by promises of big money and boxing glory, Ed makes a decision to remain loyal to Arliss. His dream in sight, Ed is on top of the world and at the top of his game. With a new found confidence he goes on the road leaving his pregnant wife at home. His sacrifice seems justified until tragedy strikes with the death of his wife leaving him a single father with a fading dream. Haunted by guilt and regret, Ed turns away from boxing and returns to a path of self-destruction. Out of shape and out of luck, he agrees to one final fight. The house is packed, the fans are cheering, the bell rings as Ed steps into the ring to fight the demons of his past to reclaim his dignity as a man and a champion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?584266</url></doc>
