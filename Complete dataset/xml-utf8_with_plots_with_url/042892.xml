<plot>The anxiety-ridden experience of not feeling confident in one's own ability to entice the opposite sex. Although the prospect of going on a blind date makes him more anxious than he would care to admit, Oliver, nonetheless, agrees to go along with it. His string of bad luck with women is long and he's ready to try anything to find love. He's prepped properly: a new haircut, a snazzy shirt and an impressive floral bouquet. He's sporting a positive attitude and ready to try it all again. But is it enough to overcome the onslaught of humiliation, intimidation and rejection that is waiting for him at his faceless rendezvous of love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042892</url></doc>
