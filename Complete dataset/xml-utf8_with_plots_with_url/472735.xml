<plot>Manoharlal Agarwal is a wealthy businessman and lives with his family consisting of three sons: Pratap, Dilip &amp; Babu, two daughters Nirmala &amp; Munni; his wife, Sharda; &amp; Pratap's wife; He asks Satyaprakash Agarwal to be the sole arbitrator in a matter concerning himself and Hariram. Before the arbitration, he gets his daughter, Nirmala, who is studying in college, to get engaged to Satyaprakash's son, Ajay, who has recently completed his college. Hoping that this will get the arbitration verdict in his favor, he gets a shock when Satyaprakash gives a decision in Hariram's favor. Angered at this humiliation, Manoharlal breaks off the engagement between Ajay and Nirmala, and gets himself appointed as a sole arbitrator in a matter with Satyaprakash on one side and Manikchand on the other. Manoharlal intends to use this position to financially ruin Satyaprakash, and he also intends to wed Nirmala with a man named Murli shortly. What Manoharlal does not know is that Nirmala and Ajay have fallen in love with each other and have decided to elope and get married. Watch what the powerful and wealthy Manoharlal does to prevent Nirmala from getting married to Ajay.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472735</url></doc>
