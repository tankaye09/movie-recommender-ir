<plot>Fathers and sons. Yaron plays junior league soccer for the Haifa Maccabees. They're having a great season, in part because Yaron lifts the team's spirits by enthusiastically broadcasting their games from a microphone at the bench. When a player is injured and Yaron plays, it's a disaster. But the one person who can't find out is his dad, Danny, whose football exploits as a youth are his favorite memory. Now a stevedore, Danny works when the games are played and thinks Yaron is a star. The Maccabees are set to play a Jerusalem team for the league championship on Saturday - Danny wants the day off and Yaron goes to the coach and begs to play. Can he be a hero to his dad?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217813</url></doc>
