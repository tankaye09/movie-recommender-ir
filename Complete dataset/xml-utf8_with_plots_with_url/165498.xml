<plot>Edgar is offered $150 by a nurseryman for a tree on his property, and he plans to remove it with the tractor he won at the county fair. But his neighbor demands some of the tree money as some leafs are hanging over his property. Edgar, on the tractor, ruins a warehouse, smashes a fire hydrant, wrecks a streetcar and tears up the concrete road pavement. Edgar is hauled to court and has to pay the damages. At home, when he yanks the tree out of the ground, it crashes down upon his car.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?165498</url></doc>
