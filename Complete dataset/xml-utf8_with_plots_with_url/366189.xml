<plot>In the midst of terrorism and corruption, India and it's citizens see a bright spot on the horizon in the shape and form of Inspector Divakar. Divakar comes from a honest and diligent family, and like his forefathers is quite capable of sacrificing everything for his Bharat (India). When a group of terrorists abduct a bus-full of passengers, the Government is prepared to negotiate so that the hostages can be freed. But Divakar does not agree, he would sacrifice the passengers rather than negotiate with the terrorists. When the terrorists learn of Divakar's opposition, they put forward a proposition: they will release the passengers in exchange for Divakar's sister. Faced with sacrificing his own flesh and blood will Divakar relent and let the Indian government negotiate with the terrorists?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366189</url></doc>
