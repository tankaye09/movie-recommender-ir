<plot>One of the greatest attractions in parks and summer resorts. When the litle engine and line of cars ready to start the passengers, including many children, scramble aboard, the engineer blows the tiny whistle, and they are off. The train is then seen rounding a long curve and coming head on at full speed. It passes with all the dash of a limited express. A receding view of the same train ends the picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370899</url></doc>
