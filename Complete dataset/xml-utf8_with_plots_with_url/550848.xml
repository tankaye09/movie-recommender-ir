<plot>"This is a very clever magician's trick. The wizard uses no other apparatus than a board and two saw-horses. On the board he stands a pretty girl and covers her with a paper cone, which he shows to be hollow and empty. He immediately sets fire to the cone, and it burns completely, revealing a skeleton where the girl stood an instant before. A few waves of the magician's wand, and the girl appears instantly in the place of the skeleton."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550848</url></doc>
