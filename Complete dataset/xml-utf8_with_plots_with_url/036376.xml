<plot>Catherine Henson has been busily preparing for her wedding to her fiancé, Steve Parker, for several months when both she and her friend and work colleague, Kim White, find out separately that a mutual friend and colleague, Amy North, has been having an affair with Steve. Following a heated exchange with Catherine in her office about the affair, Amy leaves work early in an emotional state and is then involved in a car crash which results in her untimely death in hospital the following morning. The sad news of Amy's death results in the majority of her work colleagues, including Amy's close friend, Natalie Lewis, blaming the crash on Catherine. They argue that Amy's concentration at the wheel may have been greatly reduced due to being upset from a row which had just taken place between her and Catherine. Still devastated by the news that her fiancé has had an affair with one of her best friends, Catherine now finds herself being sent to Coventry by her colleagues who blame her for indirectly causing Amy's death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036376</url></doc>
