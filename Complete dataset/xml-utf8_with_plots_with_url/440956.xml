<plot>It's winter of 1891, Jo Van Bonger (Theo Van Gogh's wife) has packages of letters with her. She tucks them carefully in a box. Two men are fitting the packing for Vincent Van Gogh's paintings. Her brother, Andries nervously begs her to discard them all - the paintings and the letters. It's 2008, Vincent van Gogh is universally recognized as a genius; he has become immortal in the eyes of the world - all owing to a woman who literally hauled his paintings and his story around her back for twenty-five years before anyone wanted them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?440956</url></doc>
