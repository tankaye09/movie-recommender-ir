<plot>The young George Washington has to do much to take care of his family. Good with math and numbers, Washington becomes a surveyor. As a youth, Washington was close to his half-brother Lawrence. When Lawrence dies, George inherits Lawrence's land and home at Mount Vernon. George Washington is elected to the Continental Congress, and when fighting breaks out between England and the colonies at Lexington, the Congress names Washington commander of the new Continental Army. Washington is not sure he is up to the task, but he loyally accepts the Commission. At first the British win easy victories over the colonial army and capture New York City. But Washington turns into a great leader. He rallies his troops, and takes his army across the Delaware River on Christmas Eve, surprising the British and winning important victories. All through the long war, Washington shows discipline, persistence and courage, inspiring his soldiers, even in the desperate days of winter encampment at Valley Forge. At this lowest point he thwarts a plan by Inspector General Conway to have him removed as head of the army and and keeps his men motivated and unified for final victory. That ultimate success is assured by the arrival of troops and equipment from France. The combined French and American forces under General Washington finally defeat the British at Yorktown. The new nation will survive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?211948</url></doc>
