<plot>The fourth of six periodic shorts,made from 1934 to 1940, by Columbia starring Walter Catlett. Mrs. Catlett (Ann Doran) is planning a surprise birthday dinner for Walter (Walter Catlett), who, while on the way home,demostrates his hatred of radios in various mishap ways. Walter's boss and his wife are among the party guests, at which Walter receives a short-wave radio set as a present, but his boss has to leave early to take a sailing trip on his new boat, but not before Walter's obnoxious brother-in-law Chester (Charles Williams) sells him an insurance policy on the boat against Walter's wishes. Later, Walter becomes intrigued with the radio set, especially when he thinks he picks up Australia but it is only Chester playing a joke. But Walter does pick up a distress call from his boss's boat, and manages to summon help.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514541</url></doc>
