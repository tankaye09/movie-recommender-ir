<plot>Imagine sixty kids staging a full-scale musical in six days. The film records the emotional highs, lows and in-betweens of more than 250 kids in five communities when Missoula Children's Theatre, via its signature little red truck, comes to town. It's magic and mayhem captured through the lens as the kids, under the direction of the two professional tour actor/directors who come with the touring truck, audition, rehearse, mess up, have the occasional meltdown, overcome personal obstacles, learn teamwork, acceptance and commitment, jump for joy, don costumes, and eventually grace the stage for a one-hour performance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?571589</url></doc>
