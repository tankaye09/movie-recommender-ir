<plot>As relations between the United States and Iran devolve into military aggression, fear of conscription for young American men becomes very real. Eric Snyder and Neil Ward have watched their friends go to war and are now faced with an impossible choice; fight for a cause in which they do not believe or abandon a way of life they do not wish to lose. As control of the Canadian and Mexican borders tighten, Eric and Neil decide to leave their friends and family behind to venture into the American West for solace. After months of seclusion, other dodgers arrive only to jeopardize their plans. Eric &amp; Neil are forced to re-enter the civilized world only to find that it is much worse than they had imagined.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411191</url></doc>
