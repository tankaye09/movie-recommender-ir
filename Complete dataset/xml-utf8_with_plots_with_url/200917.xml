<plot>Mild mannered accountant Egbert Impelson, at the end of his rope, stumbles into the Formosa Cafe in Hollywood to drowned his troubles in a whiskey sour. He stares at the timeless head shots of stylish movie stars that line the walls of the bar. He wonders to himself what Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart or even "The Duke" himself John Wayne would do if they got the news their wife was a cheating whore, their son was gay and his company just fired him. Moments later to Egbert's surprise, he finds himself caught between the real life James Cagney, Rita Hayworth and many other movie stars of the golden era that have mysteriously materialized like magic right from their photographs on the wall. Relying on the tried and true methods of the 1940's and 50's yester year, they plot, plan and argue in a attempt to help Egbert solve all his modern day dilemmas.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200917</url></doc>
