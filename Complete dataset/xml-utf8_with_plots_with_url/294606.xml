<plot>Everybody has something to hide in the murky shadows at Stone River Hotel. Shane, a loner night porter, doesn't seem to need a knife, and yet he keeps one in his locker. Shouts can be heard late at night behind door 110, where the beautiful and fragile Rachel is staying with her bully-boy husband. And when a hotel guest turns up dead, Shane finds details of his stay have been changed on the hotel register. All trails lead back to room 110, but when Shane gets there, he finds the prime suspect is himself. Will he be able to convince the police he is innocent, or will his fascination with Rachel bring about his downfall?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294606</url></doc>
