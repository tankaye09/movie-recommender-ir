<plot>"This picture is a dandy. Two children are first seen in this picture doing acrobatic feats. The acrobat appears and as he passes the children they disappear. His acrobatic feats are most wonderful and after performing a number most difficult he dons his hat which immediately returns to his head. His coat does likewise and he appears to have considerable difficulty to make them remain on his person. They finally do and after wraping his cloak around him and re-opening it the children again appear as mysteriously as they disappeared."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385415</url></doc>
