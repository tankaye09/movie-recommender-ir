<plot>Chutki (Antara Mali) lives in a small village community in Central India, and has developed a talent of mimicing bollywood actress Madhuri Dixit in every aspect. Her friend, Raja alias Rajeshwar Singh (Rajpal Yadav) is always there to encourage her. When Chutki proposes going to Bombay to meet Madhuri and be like her, she faces opposition from her parents, who are anxious to get her married. So Raja proposes marriage of convenience to her, in order to enable her to go to Bombay, which she accepts. They are married, and shortly thereafter they move to Bombay. Once there, Chutki and Raja face harsh reality, as they are virtually humiliated, and conned at every point. Then they meet talent agent, Pyarelal (Govind Namdeo) and that's when reality strikes home even more, as they learn what their real worth is.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352775</url></doc>
