<plot>"The washwoman's daughter would rather sit by the stove reading a French novel than help her mother. A visitor comes in and protests against the old lady's allowing such a lazy girl about the house. The criticism is not received with good favor, and a quarrel ensues which ends in a lively fracas."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?599997</url></doc>
