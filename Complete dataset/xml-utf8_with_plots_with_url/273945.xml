<plot>The early tribes of Japan were strongly influenced by ancient China. Eventually a closed feudalism developed, which produced a distinctive civilization. Life was controlled by emperors, shogan generals and samurai warriors. Once the nation was forced to open to the "western" world, there were major changes in their technology, and in fact in all aspects of life. This eventually led to a major war, their destruction by atomic bombs, and the need to rebuild. About all that was left was their cultural value of national pride and loyalty.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?273945</url></doc>
