<plot>The real-life Jerry Lewis opens a camera store in Los Angeles, and Ralph Staub drops by to visit with Jerry, as does Diana Lynn, Rhonda Fleming, Georgie Jessell---who never let anything happen in Hollywood without showing up with his home-movie 16 mm, and may have bought some film from Jerry on Grand Opening Day---and also, of course, Jerry's comedy-team partner, Dean Martin. Later, Ralph drops in on former 20th Century-Fox star, Dick Haymes, who was now working as a radio-Disc Jockey. This entry in Columbia's Screen Snapshots series got more bookings than the usual shorts in the series, as theatre exhibitors saw a chance to bill it as a "new" Martin &amp; Lewis film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243231</url></doc>
