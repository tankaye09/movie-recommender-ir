<plot>Mattie (Michael Learned) thought her life was going fine. Her long-time husband (Ed Asner) was a good provider, and her son was grown with children of his own. But there were things they didn't discuss. That is, until her first husband (and her son's biological father), showed up after many years. Two-time Tony Award winner John Cullum played the first husband, Clyde, while his son, noted actor JD Cullum, played the same character in the black &amp; white flashbacks (with Kate Anthony as the young Mattie). The program was distributed as a FamilyWorks! special, and a closing voice-over promoted adoption and provided a phone number for Family Services America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361324</url></doc>
