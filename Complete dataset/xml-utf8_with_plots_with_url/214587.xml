The first drive-in theater opened in New Jersey, Bonnie and Clyde were killed in an ambush in Louisiana, Porky Pig and Donald Duck made their national debut. In the hollows of the Great Depression, one of America's most astonishing sports stories sprouted. A team of knobby-kneed Bellfountain High boys, whose school had 27 students, were pitted against schools with over 1700 students in the 1937 Oregon State Basketball Championship.
