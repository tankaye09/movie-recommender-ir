<plot>25 Cent preview is a very real look at the physical and emotional side of two street hustlers Marcus And DotCom, as they tour the Tenderloin district of San Francisco, with every intention of doing wrong, even their lies are true. On this fateful night of board meetings, and negotiations with Sex Money and Drugs, a surprise visit propels them both to examine who they are, and where they come from. As DotCom says, "As a man some things in life you just can't sleep with." 25 Cent preview hurts where it hurts, and loves where it loves.</plot><plot>25 Cent preview is a very real look at the physical and emotional side of two street hustlers Marcus And DotCom, as they tour the Tenderloin district of San Francisco, with every intention of doing wrong, even their lies are true.
