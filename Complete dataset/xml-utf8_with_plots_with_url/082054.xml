<plot>Bread from Heaven is an account of how Jesus has compassion for the multitudes that have come to hear Him minister. The story begins with a young street urchin named Jonas who is begging for each bit of food he can get. After an incident of trickery, he takes bread from the local bakers, Zeke and Jethro. He refuses to share his bread with an old man who is weak and clearly in need of nourishment. Later Jonas finds himself listening to the words of Jesus on the mountain. He is inspired by His message. When Jesus asks for food to feed the people, Jonas unselfishly offers the five loaves and two fishes. After Jesus prays over the food, the disciples feed the people. Zeke and Jethro are amazed at the miracle of feeding the masses and come up with a plan to make Jesus king. They want Jesus to perform miracles so they will no longer have to work. When Jesus tells them He is the Bread of Life, the bakers think He is joking and return to their ovens. Jesus goes to pray and soon sees that His disciples are caught in a storm. As the disciples fear for their lives, Jesus calms the waters by walking upon them. Peter proclaims his faith in Jesus as the Son of the living God. Jonas' faith has given him a new compassion, and he shares bread with the bullies in the street. In the end, Jonas returns to the old man who was denied the bread. He shares his bread and tells him of the man he met named Jesus, who is the Bread of Life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082054</url></doc>
