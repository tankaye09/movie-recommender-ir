<plot>The Exam portrays the difficult school life of the high school students Mert, Sinan, Gamze, Kaan and Uluç, who suffer under the pressures of the forthcoming university entrance exam. In order to study, they must keep their grade point averages as high as possible, which is not the case yet. When one day they succeed in stealing exam questions of a lesson, they come up with the daring idea of cracking the university question database as well, in order to pass the nightmarish entrance exam. But this is easier said than done: How does one access the exam questions that are prepared by a governmental agency and are protected by armed guards like Fort Knox? There is only one thief (Jean-Claude van Damme) in the world, which possesses the skills required to do this... But how can one convince him to come to Turkey and do the job? It quickly becomes clear that the reckless idea has become a consequence-filled adventure, dragging the five friends rapidly with it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?498019</url></doc>
