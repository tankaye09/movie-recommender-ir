<plot>We have always had warriors, from as far back in history as one can go - warriors are timeless. Warriors have a moral code and are not simply trained killers (as they are all too frequently portrayed). If we did not have warriors, we would undoubtedly be speaking another language, German, Japanese, Chinese, or Russian. Warriors are born, they are not created. Certainly they are trained, but to be a warrior is a calling. We should be forever grateful to our warriors and to their families who are all so courageous. We should honor our warriors. Warriors are NOT, as they are commonly portrayed, victims with no where else to go but the military. This project will show people what intelligent, honorable, and brave people we have standing in the way of the free world's demise.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647691</url></doc>
