<plot>The poor cast and crew of the series try so hard to make a relevant science fiction show, but end up with, you know, Star Fury. From their overly-method lead actor to their feminist director who isn't above trying to sleep her way to the top, Star Fury has a cast who can just as easily play it slap-stick as they can skewer political sacred cows. Plus, to drive ratings, you can trot out science fiction icons as guest stars because, let's face it, they need the work. All this hilarity, and on the cheap, too. Throw together a single sci-fi set, a production office, craft services room, and you are good to go. Later, we can take our cast on the road to conventions, out on dates, and maybe a jail scene after a misunderstanding with three transvestites. The possibilities are as endless as the galaxies that Star Fury visits.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513517</url></doc>
