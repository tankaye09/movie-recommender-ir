<plot>In Everything Is Ordinary, a family waits for its patriarch to die amid the petty dramas that make up their lives. Throughout, the little girl, Sarah, just wants to share her discoveries, but can't pull the adults away from their own concerns. In the end she connects with the only person able to hear her. This is a work of memory and how, when we look back on the big events in our lives, what so often comes to mind are the small details of what we were doing at the time. In this sense, everything is ordinary. Because in the moment of extreme emotion, we cannot truly reflect on what is happening. There is no perspective. Only the little girl can truly connect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184518</url></doc>
