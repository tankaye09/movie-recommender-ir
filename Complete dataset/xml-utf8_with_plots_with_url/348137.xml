<plot>By following the Lynne Stewart's case this film explores how the Bush administration used the September 11th attacks to push forward a concerted attack on the American justice system and in a number of cases changed strongly held judicial traditions like habeas corpus and the right of a defendant to have adequate legal counsel. Most importantly this film look at the long-range impact of these actions and pose the question: has something fundamental been altered in the US and international justice systems and impacted individual freedoms and the very essence of democracy - something that will outlive the Bush administration and persist far into the 21st century?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?348137</url></doc>
