<plot>This video game follows the tale of a man who was so cocky that he declared even Death couldn't best him in battle. Of course, Death appeared and challenged Chakan with a proposition. If Chakan could defeat him, he'd be granted with eternal life. If Chakan lost the match, he'd become Death's eternal servant.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?098987</url></doc>
