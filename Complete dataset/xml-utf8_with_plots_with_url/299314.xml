<plot>Ciechocinek, a famous spa in Poland is visited each year by thousands of people. In a short period of time they want to be cured and feel better - both physically and emotionally. The characters of a film meet in one sanatorium - they get their medical treatment, but also enjoy their strolls in a summer sun, concerts and dancing parties. Three weeks spent together is not much, but may be enough to find happiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?299314</url></doc>
