Years later, Anand has grown up to be a doctor and travels to Bombay, India, to work together with Dr. Pradhan for six months, thereafter he must return home and get married to Lalita, who is the daughter of Thakur's Legal Advisor, Jackson. Six months go by and Anand does not return, the Thakur, along with Jackson and Lalita, also travel to India to bring him back. This is where they find out that Anand has been romancing Rajkumari Sanyogta and both are expected to get married soon.
