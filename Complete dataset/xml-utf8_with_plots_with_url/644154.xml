<plot>A drunkard believes he has killed a man during an bar-room brawl and as a result is forced to flee and live his entire life in hiding. His two young daughters suffer greatly under these conditions, and the punishment inflicted on the father seems all the more harsh for the fact that his victim had not perished after all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?644154</url></doc>
