<plot>This subject is most mystifying and humorous from start to finish. A cripple enters the doctor's office, hobbling along upon his hands, both legs having been taken off just below the hips. He asks the doctor to fix him up, and the doctor indicates that this is an easy matter. He places the cripple upon a table, and taking two legs from a closet, places them on the cripple, one after the other. The cripple finds to his delight that the legs adhere firmly, and he jumps from the table and dances about the room in great glee. One of the best of the mystical series.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578059</url></doc>
