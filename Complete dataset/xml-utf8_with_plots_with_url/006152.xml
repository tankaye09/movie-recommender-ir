<plot>Vic, the super-agent, negotiates with the corrupt, alcoholic Albanian producer over Sal Macino (Vic's client) and his commitment to the action blockbuster, "AK-47th St." Vic pleads with Sal to accept the starring role in the movie for fifty million dollars. Sal does not answer him because he only speaks in his past movie quotations. Vic's other client, List Balken is second in line for the job, and ventures over to Sal's home to discuss the deal. List also only speaks in his and other past movie quotations. Dredo, a character from Sal's past movies is always present in Sal's home. As the deadline approaches, Vic resorts to extreme measures to seal the deal.</plot><plot>Vic, the super-agent, negotiates with the corrupt, alcoholic Albanian producer over Sal Macino (Vic's client) and his commitment to the action blockbuster, "AK-47th St." Vic pleads with Sal to accept the starring role in the movie for fifty million dollars.
