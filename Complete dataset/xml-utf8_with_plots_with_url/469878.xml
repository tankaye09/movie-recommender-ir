<plot>David Rubinoff, who appeared in the vast, vast majority of his films (and there were many) and radio appearances (of which there were hundreds) billed simply as Rubinoff(and his Violin),and most film goers and radio listeners of the time never knew he had a first name, or thought "and His Violin" was his last name, is performing here in a night club setting. As the plays the violin, guests at tables ask him questions, such as "Are you married?", etc. He answers them by playing certain selections on his fiddle. Since the songs include "Fiddlin on the Fiddle", "Give Me a Moment Please", "When Day is Done" and "Dark Eyes", the questions had to be somewhat contrived. Claire James ( as Clair James,fresh from her 1938 runnerup in the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City) sings a song, June Hart and Jack Holland (III) dance to one, as also does the team of Collette &amp; Barry. "Footage from this short was later incorporated into a 1946 "Melody Masters" called "Headline Bands", and this short itself was reissued by Warners on January 3, 1948.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469878</url></doc>
