<plot>It has been six months since newlyweds Summer and Derek have made love. The reason? Her parents are staying with them, their ashes are anyway, and she doesn't want to have sex while her folks are in the house. The problem that she's having trouble letting go. Her parents were Hollywood's top movie extras, appearing in nearly 200 films, and one of their last wishes (before dying in a car accident) was to have their ashes put into urns and given to largest prop houses in Los Angeles so they could continue their film careers even after death. It's been half a year now and Derek has had enough. Finally he gets Summer to agree to fulfill their final requests. This is the last day with her parents urns, and Derek a wanna be director, records the whole thing... eagerly because he knows that after it's done he gets his life back... especially his sex life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009503</url></doc>
