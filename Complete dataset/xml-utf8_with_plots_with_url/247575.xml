<plot>Curtis Harrington began making films as a teenager in the 1940s, beginning with his take on Edgar Allan Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" on 8mm. During his fifty year career as a director, Harrington made many horror films dealing with the unseen and the macabre, featuring legendary Hollywood stars. "House of Harrington" profiles Curtis' fascinating career, which ended with a full-circle return to the work of Edgar Allan Poe in 2002.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?247575</url></doc>
