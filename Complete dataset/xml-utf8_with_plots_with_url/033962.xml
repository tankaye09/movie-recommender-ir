<plot>'Amazing Adventures of a Nobody' is a documentary/factual entertainment TV series that follows Leon, the presenter, on his travels around the UK on just 5 pounds a day. The 5 pounds has to cover food, accommodation and travel; the 5 pounds reflecting the average hourly wage according to the Department of Trade and Industry in the U.K. Leon had certain cities he had to pass through and was only ever allowed to stay for 24 hours in each city. The 5 pounds could not roll over and had to be spent, with each morning being presented a new five pound note for each new day. The public could buy him things and he could work for goods, but was never allowed to be given money directly. The results were truly amazing, hence the name, with our "nobody" meeting some fascinating people such as Jack the lobster fisherman in locations as grand as Lord Glasgow's Scottish castle and as beautiful as the Welsh Coast.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033962</url></doc>
