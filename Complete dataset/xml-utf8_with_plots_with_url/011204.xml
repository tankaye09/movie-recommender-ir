<plot>Rebecca cheated on her husband Isaac one time, out of a need for a man's touch, which Isaac has not provided for a long time. On Rebecca's one fling, she happens to encounter a vampire, who makes love to her before taking her life and turning her into one of the undead like himself. Blaming Isaac's inattentiveness for driving her into the arms of another man, and thus becoming a vampire, she returns to him to seek her revenge. Isaac must withstand Rebecca's wrath, and save his daughter's life as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?011204</url></doc>
