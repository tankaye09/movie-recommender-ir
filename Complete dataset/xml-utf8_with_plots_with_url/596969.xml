<plot>An intellectual drama concerning America's most controversial poet. The Treason and Life-Long trial of America's Poet Laureate gone haywire! Interspersed between interrogation are flashes from his life. An intellectual drama concerning America's most controversial poet. The guru to T.S. Eliot, Frost, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Ginsburg and more was a seriously flawed intellectual giant; his fears of conspiracies, secret societies and Jewish banker cabals caused him to make pro-Fascist broadcasts during WWII. This story addresses mankind's chronic problem with popular delusions and theories, based upon inaccurate knowledge and racial, religious, and conspiracy fear that plague society. This is the story of America's most controversial poet and critic. He was tried for treason after WWII for his pro-Fascist broadcasts made during the war, found not guilty, but remanded to a prison hospital for twelve years just the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596969</url></doc>
