<plot>Wealthy Lillian Belton attempts suicide by taking a drug overdose, so her physician, Gordon Phillips, sends her to psychiatrist Mary White for treatment. Lillian calls Jack Kerry from Mary's office and then tries to jump out of the window, being stopped by Mary, who learns that Jack is the reason for Lillian's distress. Jack is an alcoholic and doesn't care for Lillian, who loves him dearly. Mary convinces Jack to enter a rehabilitation program to cure his alcoholism. After some setbacks and eight months, Jack is apparently cured, but has developed a strong attachment to Mary, who reminds him that Lillian's dependence on him is just as strong. So Lillian and Jack are married and are apparently happy. Meanwhile, Gordon has been trying to persuade Mary to give up her practice and marry him, but Mary feels she's too devoted to her practice to give it up. At a costume ball, Jack tells Mary he loves her and that she also must love him. As they dance, Lillian gets intensely jealous, accusing Mary of trying to wrest Jack from her, and threatening a scandalous divorce. Although she has strong feelings for Jack, Mary reminds him of his obligations in his marriage and hopes he will reconcile with Lillian. At the same time she examines her relationship with Gordon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?558253</url></doc>
