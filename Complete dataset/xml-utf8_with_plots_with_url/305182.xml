<plot>An entire evening of magical entertainment is included in the 100 feet which composes the film. Hermann himself would have been proud of the result obtained. Our friend, the magician, first steps forward and produces an ivory billiard ball from space. With a wave of his hand he changes it into a full sized bowling ball, and in order to show that there is no limit to his ability makes one more change and holds in his hand a large cloth, known in magician circles as a "foulard." From this he produces a sleek and prosperous-looking rabbit, and then, apparently from nowhere, the stage is graced by the appearance of a charming lady in fancy costume. Holding the foulard in front of the lady, but allowing her head and shoulders to appear, he gradually raises the lower part of the cloth when it is seen that her "visible means of support" have entirely disappeared, leaving only the head and shoulder pendant in the atmosphere. These in turn disappear and the stage is empty until a large hoop covered with paper is seen to swing from side to side and, upon a pistol being fired, the lady makes her final appearance by jumping through the hoop as it swings and the film closes with her final bow to the audience. This also is a new film and one which in itself is an entire evening's entertainment. Don't overlook it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?305182</url></doc>
