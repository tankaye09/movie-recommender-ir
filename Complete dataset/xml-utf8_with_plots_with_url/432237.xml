<plot>Two creatures compare their hearts, each believing that its own is the best. One has a heart that is really big and smooth while the other has a brightly colored and clean heart. They argue for a while, each trying to convince the other that its own heart is the most perfect. Suddenly, a third creature appears. It stops the two from fighting and explains how its heart, even though it is ugly and made of differently colored and shaped pieces that don't fit together quite right, is the best of all. The third creature explains how he shares its heart with others and the heart grows, becoming filled with friendship and love. The first two realize that this third creature is right. So, they all decide to share their hearts and become friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432237</url></doc>
