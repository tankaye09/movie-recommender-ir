<plot>La jaula (The Cage) narrates the situations family members live through after the arrival of a pair of birds to the house (a gift from the father to his daughter). This event awakens certain attitudes in the little girl, Isabel, as she diverts all her attention on her new pets. At the same time, the members of the family interpret in different ways what Isabel is thinking and feeling, according to the situations they are living though. Isabel feels that the birds are sad, which is why her mother (Ana), father (Julio) and grandmother (Doña Pilar), try to interpret the sadness of the birds to satisfy Isabel's wishes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?310568</url></doc>
