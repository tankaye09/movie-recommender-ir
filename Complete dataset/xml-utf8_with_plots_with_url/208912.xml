<plot>The time is 1589 in Pisa Italy. As a professor in a university classroom, Galileo questions the ideas of Aristotle. Knowing that he could be convicted of heresy, he continues to teach that the sun is the center of the universe and not the earth. He proves his theories by improving a toy called the spyglass. With his new invention of the telescope, he discovers Jupiter has moons revolving around it. This was the proof he needs to show that not everything revolves around the earth. Clavius, a friend of Galileos, convinces him to sign a document that says he will not teach that Aristotle is wrong, so he can continue to share his theories. Pope Urban tells Galileo that he can write a book if he presents both his and Aristotles views fairly. Columbe, being jealous of Galileo, finds the document signed by Galileo promising not to teach that Aristole is wrong. Columbe has a forger add to the document that Galileo also promises never to teach his own theories again. Galileo is found guilty of heresy and is sentenced to house arrest. His faithful servant, Sagredo, is at his side as he dies. Sagredo takes the writings of Galileo and smuggles them into Holland where they can be printed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208912</url></doc>
