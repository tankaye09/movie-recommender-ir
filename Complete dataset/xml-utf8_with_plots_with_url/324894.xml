<plot>Francoise, 25, and Alexandre, 27, live in Lausanne and plan to marry soon. Alexandre suggests having the religious ceremony in Cameroon, where Françoise was born. With the help of Francoise's African uncle the couple embark on extensive marriage preparations. In Africa marriage is a big event, and celebrated accordingly, so inevitably, the couple's families have rather different ideas and hilarious misunderstandings ensue.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?324894</url></doc>
