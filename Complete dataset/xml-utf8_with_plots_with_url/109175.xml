<plot>A maid shows the coal man where to deposit the coal he is bringing in. As he appears a clown assails him with a club. Discovering who his tormentor is, he hides behind a door, intending to return the beating with interest. In his excitement he knocks over the maid, and a lively scene follows. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109175</url></doc>
