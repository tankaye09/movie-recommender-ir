<plot>The 2720s: The Earth is in decay and so are many of its colonies. A young and terrible kid is growing up by himself in a single-room "kindergarten cell" surrounded by the high-tech of the new millennium. For one of his birthdays, he receives an android nurse: beautiful woman-transformer, programmed to teach and protect the kid. Eventually the kid grows, gets accepted in the Space Academy and discovers enemies and friends as he races through the known Universe in the search for the Space Firebird, a semi-mythical creature of energy. In an effort to know the race of such a tenacious explorer, the creature "enters" the android and falls in love with its master and friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238299</url></doc>
