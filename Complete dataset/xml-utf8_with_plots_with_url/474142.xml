<plot>Saint of 9/11 presents the turbulent, restless, spiritual and remarkable journey of Father Mychal Judge. Compassionate champion of the needy and forgotten, a beloved Fire Department Chaplain, rousing Irish-American balladeer and iconoclast, Father wrestled with his own private demons while touching others in powerful and miraculous ways. Mychal Judge knew the pain of loss and suffering. He struggled with alcoholism and was an outspoken AA advocate. Father Judge was a gay man who loved his priestly work. Saint of 9/11 portrays Mychal's life as a spiritual adventure and an honest embrace of life, where alcoholism and sexuality were acknowledged. Saint of 9/11 is the story of a life's journey interrupted. Inspired by his life, the documentary embraces Mychal's full humanity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474142</url></doc>
