<plot>On a grey, cold Sunday in November four young 'skins' meet as usually on the premises of a gas-station in a high density area of a German city. Bored the three guys and one girl begin to accost passers-by and customers especially if those seem 'different' or 'foreign'. Competing for 'coolness' the young men become aggressive and take to violence. The cashier, a girl of Turkish origin is seriously attacked although one of the guys seems to have known her closer. On open ending in brutality, flash-backs suggesting the possibility of different turnings and additional material included with the film (as well as interviews with the protagonists) invite classroom discussions on subjects like discrimination against minorities, xenophobia, violence and what to do about that as an individual or in group</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210503</url></doc>
