<plot>"The surprising speed with which a wreck of some of our leading American railroads is cleared up due to the fact that expert crews are drilled to respond to an alarm with as much vigor as may be seen in a metropolitan fire station. This view illustrated a most remarkable feat. At the opening, a locomotive attached to several flat cars carrying the wrecking apparatus is standing quietly in the yard. A messenger rushes up with a telegram announcing a wreck. Within 30 seconds a crew of about 50 men, including the engineer and fireman, have boarded the train, got it under headway and out of the field of the camera. Several belated employees running to catch the train give an amusing spirit comedy to the picture."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?190438</url></doc>
