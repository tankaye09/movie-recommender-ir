<plot>Intellectual property rights is a new, poorly understood and rarely enforced concept in China. Often intentions are to "do the right thing", but the cost of being law abiding can be overwhelming. Blindness: Saramago in China tells a story about the adaptation by China's top drama company of a play based on Nobel Prize winner Jose Saramago's novel 'Blindness'. After contacting Saramago's agency, rounds of dramatic and frustrating negotiations took place. Our camera followed the negotiation and the preparation of the play. The documentary turns abstract differences in mindsets into a vivid story through the actions of the people in this documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074858</url></doc>
