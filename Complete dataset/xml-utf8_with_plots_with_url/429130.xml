<plot>At a time in need of humanitarian innovation, one man, Dr. Albert Hofmann, determined to ease the pain of mankind toiled endlessly in search of a cure for migraines. With his only assistant, Maxwell, by his side, the two worked fruitlessly for five years. Finally, April 19, 1943 the day of the 25th experiment, their hard work and perseverance paid off. In his directorial debut, writer/director Chris McInroy weaves together the events of that momentous day. The day a substance was invented that would change the brainwaves of mankind forever. A substance that would not only cure migraines but would open the doors of perception for generations to come.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429130</url></doc>
