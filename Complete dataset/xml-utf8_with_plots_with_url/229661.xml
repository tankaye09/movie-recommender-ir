<plot>Hooligan happens in at a country cottage, and after disturbing the ladies proceeds to investigate the interior of the cottage by thrusting his head through the window. Unfortunately, he brings the window down on his head and hangs there kicking until Gloomy Gus rescues him. An extra good subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229661</url></doc>
