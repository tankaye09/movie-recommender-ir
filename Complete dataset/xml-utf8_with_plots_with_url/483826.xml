Bobby catches Jonathan writing a love letter, and Bobby assumes its to the new girl, Sylvia. But when Aimee reads out a love letter she's received, Bobby knows who the culprit is. Only problem is, she thinks it's from Travis! When Sylvia decides to toy with Travis, and go over to his house to work on their school project - he assumes she wants to spend the night with him, with disasterous consequences!
