<plot>A woman who's off camera asks eight guys questions: what are other words for penis, what would your penis wear if you dressed it, two words it might say, ever measured it, how long is it erect, how long when flaccid, and has it ever been a nuisance?

All wear shirts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109791</url></doc>
