<plot>A comical looking man facing the audience and reading a letter, evidently from his wife, who is on a visit to her mother. Judging from his smiling countenance, she has started the letter with some very nice story. Suddenly the expression on the man's face changes. His mother-in-law is going to pay a visit. Here he is seen almost crying. He braces up, however, and as the picture closes, it brings his face closer and closer, until it is of enormous size. Very humorous facial expressions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?464204</url></doc>
