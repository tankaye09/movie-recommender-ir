<plot>The plot is like a combination of a 1970s made-for-TV crime drama and Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew." Vikram (called Vicky) murders in self-defense a man who was blackmailing his father over an illegitimate son he once had. Encouraged by his uncle, Vicky goes into hiding, where he meets a rebellious girl named Anju, who has organized a group of women who physically beat up men for doing anything so bad as even winking at girls. Disguised variously as a woman and as a wealthy prince, Vicky converts Anju to the path of womanliness, and they decide to get married. However, at the engagement party, the police finally catch up with Vicky and take him away. It is then that Vicky remembers for the first time a detail which proves that he couldn't have been the man who shot the blackmailer. It is then up to Vicky, Anju and the rest of the cast to find the real murderer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?492710</url></doc>
