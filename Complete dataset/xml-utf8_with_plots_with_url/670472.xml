<plot>Xiao Lan grew up in an environment like that of many others: she had a home she wasn't sure she could go back to; she had a group of friends she wasn't sure she could trust. She never bothered to think over and analyze such time-bound problems. For her, being young was the only way one could combat this environment: there was no need to dwell upon being hurt and all that. Yet, upon her good friend Xiao Lan's suicide, she finally realized that some things were heavier, much graver than she had originally thoughts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670472</url></doc>
