<plot>A small Russian town is prospering, because it's main industry is the chocolate factory. But this kind of prosperity comes at a very high price. Everybody in this town is eating plenty of chocolate, and everyone is suffering from diabetes. There is a thick smell of chocolate in the air, and the local river has brown water, that is filthy with chocolate pollution. So people decided to put an end to their suffering and to shut the chocolate factory down. But the chocolate business is so lucrative, that the factory is expanding, and rapidly increasing the production of chocolate. Conscious citizens are terrified, and an anti-chocolate riot is brewing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?493941</url></doc>
