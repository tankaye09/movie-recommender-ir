<plot>In these 4 short films the characters are at odds with themselves and with their environment. The kitchen and the dining room suite turn out to be settings in the film that can be both stressful and unsettling. In 4 different ways the characters rearrange and adapt their individual spaces. In the first part a woman, sitting alone in front of her dishes, makes shoulder pads with coffee cups. In the second part a man, on hands and knees, carries on his back a table covered with tableware and a woman. In the third a woman stretches her body forward to the floor, while a sinister hand puts teapots and saucers in her dress. In the last film a woman is sliding across the table on top of cups and saucers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430681</url></doc>
