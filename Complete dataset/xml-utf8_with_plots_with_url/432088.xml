<plot>On the day of her best friend Brian's (Hoke) funeral, Ana (Lucas) is paid an untimely visit from Brian's estranged sister Gina (Stacey James). Through their conversation, Ana explains how the two met, their dating disasters and ultimately, Brian's final days after being diagnosed with cancer. Though she came with simple memories and questions of her brother, Gina also brought along her brother's final gift to Ana, a picture he has worked his entire lifetime to achieve. Scored beautifully by Zack Ryan (ASCAP), the film is also accompanied by an unreleased song from Singer/Songwriter Kyle Puccia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432088</url></doc>
