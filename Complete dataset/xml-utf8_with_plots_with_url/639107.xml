<plot>Via Rio is an ode to our human desire for relationship. The film tumbles through a series of relationships woven around one woman's narration of her parents' marriage. This woman is a fresh and fecund personality who relates the story of her mother's infidelities while sitting naked and pregnant in a garden. Interspersed around this narrative are a number of other scenes which feeds the complex nature of human interaction. Interaction that is sometimes comic, sometimes lonely, but as the very pregnant Mafra indicates-inevitably part of life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?639107</url></doc>
