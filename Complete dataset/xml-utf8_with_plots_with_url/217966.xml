<plot>Arun Prajapati has been trying to be a successful TV anchor but success has always eluded him. He only blames God for this. Arun is head over heels in love with Alia, who is a TV anchor and a well-known star working in the same channel but he has never been able to express his love for her. Destiny plays a cruel game with him when Rocky is appointed as an anchor for the channel. Arun starts believing that Rocky will win over Alia. Circumstances go out of hand for Arun and he gets thrown out of the channel. He has nobody to blame but God Himself. And very soon he has an encounter with the Almighty. An argument ensues between the two. God then decides to give Arun the power to run earth for seven days as Arun claims that he can do a better job. After Arun becomes God, he becomes successful. He puts Rocky into an uneasy spot and wins Alia's heart. Also, he grants everybody's wish. But much to his dismay this becomes the biggest problem of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?217966</url></doc>
