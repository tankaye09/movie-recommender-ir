<plot>During Holy Week, millions of people in the mainly Roman Catholic country of the Philippines celebrate the Passion of Christ in an almost unique way. During these days the roads turn red in blood due to the thousands of penitents who decide to flagellate themselves and, thus, to atone for their sins and those of their community. In the pinnacle of the processions someone gets to the point of being even nailed to the cross: Ruben Enage is one of them and, after 22 years of crucifixions, he is still willing to sacrifice, as an extreme act of penance, faith and compassion. In the meantime, while Ruben and many other faithful take their sacrifice very seriously, thousands of tourists and 'camera-toting gawkers' flock in and give the opportunity to commercial businesses of every kind to mushroom all over. They call it 'Maleldo' (the 'beloved week'), and San Fernando Pampanga is one of the most important centers of these practices in the Philippines.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354298</url></doc>
