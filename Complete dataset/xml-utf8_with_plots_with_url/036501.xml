<plot>This moving picture is made after the celebrated painting by the same name. A number of young women are seated in a restaurant partaking of liquid refreshments. One is accompanied by her best young man who is flirted with by a young lady at another table. When the young man's lady friend discovers the flirtation she insults the other female and they instantly arranged for a duel. The scene changes and the women with their seconds are seen on the battle ground. Both the principals are stripped to the waist. They engage in a sword fight which ends in one of the contestants being mortally wounded. She is picked up from the ground by her adversary and the seconds place her in the carriage which originally carried them to the spot, and they all disappear before the officers can arrive. This picture is bound to create an encore wherever shown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036501</url></doc>
