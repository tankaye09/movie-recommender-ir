<plot>Does your life have a pattern - or is it just a random series of freaky coincidences? This is the question Anya Mandelbrot has been asking herself ever since the day her father was killed by a can of cat food. In the universe of TRIPTYCH, anything can (and must) happen: chance meetings, bizarre deaths, prophetic dreams, and life-changing revelations. Along the way, Anya confronts her childhood fears, finds unlikely new friends, and begins to look at her messed-up life from an entirely new vantage point. Anya's not-in-Kansas-anymore odyssey begins the night she meets Austin, an artist who has somehow managed to capture her entire life story on canvas...even though they've never met. Soon after, Austin is killed - leaving Anya to wonder if she really is bad luck for any man who gets close to her. She sets off on a journey to find the missing panels of Austin's three-part portrait of her life. What will the Triptych reveal - and is Anya ready for the answers?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?618491</url></doc>
