<plot>The story takes place in a dark, magical Victorian era London. Spring Heeled Jack, a tiny goblin with spring for legs spends his nights smelling the cold night air for the distinctive odor of a naughty child fast asleep in bed. As soon as he catches the scent he's away, springing across the snow covered rooftops of the city until he arrives outside the right window...he's never seen, at least not by anyone who ever be able to speak again as Jack's night time assignment is to steal as many voices as he can to fill the rows and rows of empty jars in his endless cavern lair.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511629</url></doc>
