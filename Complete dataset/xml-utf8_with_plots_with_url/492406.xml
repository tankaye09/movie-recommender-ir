After the Battle of Hastings, Saxon Thane Robin Aelredson of Denby fights for justice under the iron fist rule of his new King William the Conqueror. Forced from his home by the Norman invaders, Robin takes refuge in Sherwood forest with a band of loyal supporters, outlawed and risking death at the hands of Ralf FitzGerald, the dangerous and enigmatic Sheriff of Nottingham.
