<plot>Alfonso Malaspina is a famous stage actor. He is forced to stay at home since almost two weeks for a multiple fracture at his leg, as a consequence of a car accident. Malaspina is in a very depressed mood, from which he looks for a relief in alcohol. In short, at the Central Theater, "The Tempest" by William Shakespeare will open, a production where he was supposed to play the main role. Given the accident he has been forced to give up and to see the main role given to another actor, his worst opponent. One morning he breaks the radio. After fixing it, he realizes that he can set only one frequency, 97.4 FM. All the other stations produce nothing but static noise. He will also realize, later on, that the news given at the radio are 24 hours ahead of reality. Malaspina tries to take advantage of this weird temporal phenomenon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007216</url></doc>
