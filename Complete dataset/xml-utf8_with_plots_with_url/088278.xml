<plot>When a 21 year old computer geek, Akira finally saves enough money to buy a computer, a model 9821, he rushes to the store to find it sold out in five minutes! On his way home, a man tries to sell him the same PC he just tried to buy... or does he? He finds it isn't quite a personal computer. Instead of a 9821, the man on the street sold him a model 2198. In a nutshell, the 2198 model is a new super advanced "bio-type" girl shaped computer named Mimi. She needs constant memory upgrades, which come in the form of Akira's "active molecules," out of his "installer." Yup, life is good, considering Akira's new computer follows him to school, all the while being attacked by other bio-type computers. Oh well, better start on more of those memory upgrades Akira!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088278</url></doc>
