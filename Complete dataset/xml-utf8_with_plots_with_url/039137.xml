<plot>Saint-Josse-ten-Noode is the smallest borough in Brussels, the capital of Europe. It is also the poorest. A socialist Mayor has been ruling there for almost 50 years, defending the right to difference and staying attentive to the community. The film draws a subtly shaded picture of a political entity, as one might find anywhere in the world, forming a portrait of an out of the ordinary Mayor, in the daily practice of his duties.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039137</url></doc>
