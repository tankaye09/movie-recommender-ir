<plot>An early educational series. Short films produced by the Encyclopedia Britannica were followed by lecture by Dr. McClintock. About ten months after its debut, a readers' poll in Television magazine rated this program as important but dull. The sponsor, U.S. Rubber, relying on this poll, made one of the oddest decisions in TV history: they insisted that a musical segment featuring new talent be added. This new format lasted a few weeks before the series was canceled.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?487016</url></doc>
