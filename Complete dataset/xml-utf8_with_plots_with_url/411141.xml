<plot>Set against the scenic backdrop of a vibrant New England fall...a story of homecoming and healing unfolds when Kurt (Dan Clay) hits the streets of Garrison Falls, New Hampshire. Traveling for nearly three years after his mother's death, Kurt is back to reconcile with his father Kenneth (Bill Humphreys) and brother Elijah (Jeff Fritz). But his plans are quickly derailed when he befriends Dwayne (Jerry Howe), a benevolent comrade of the town misfits. Over a game of cards, Kurt meets Eddie (Michael Walsh), a deadbeat dad hiding from gambling debts, and Seamus (Matt Magennis), an antisocial pack rat withdrawn from the world around him. Together, the four characters form an uncompromising fellowship that pushes them into the fringes of society. This is a stirring and complex vision wrapped in breathtaking scenery.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411141</url></doc>
