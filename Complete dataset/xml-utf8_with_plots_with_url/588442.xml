<plot>Since discovering an ancient scroll in Hebron, Israel, American biblical historian Thomas Hamilton and his trusted friend and colleague, Israeli biblical linguist Michael Sieff, have been consumed with the notion of the Samson Effect-the idea that a long-lost elixir can allow an ordinary person to perform superhuman feats. When they happen upon a second parchment that not only confirms the existence of the Samson Effect but could potentially lead them to its source, the scholars embark on an impassioned crusade for the truth behind the myth. But Hamilton and Sieff aren't the only ones intent on uncovering the secret of Samson's strength. It isn't long before their pursuit becomes a deadly one, and Hamilton and Sieff come to the grim realization that the Samson Effect is more powerful and far-reaching than they ever anticipated. In the wrong hands, it could trigger a worldwide catastrophe. A chilling and suspenseful tale of political and religious intrigue set in the unforgiving landscape of the Middle East, The Samson Effect wanders the boundaries of obsession and love, betrayal and allegiance, and vengeance and justice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?588442</url></doc>
