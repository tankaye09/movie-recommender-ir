<plot>Hosted by Stargate SG-1's Amanda Tapping. Proof Positive Evidence of the Paranormal explores the blurry line between science fiction and science fact. This weekly, one-hour series uses cutting-edge forensics to test evidence of human encounters with the paranormal. Each episode looks at three stories (including encounters with ghosts and aliens as well as reincarnation, demonic possession, unexplained lights, etc.), all of which contain convincing evidence that the story is true. After the stories are recounted with interviews and documentary footage, the evidence is subjected to rigorous forensic testing by scientists and field-specific experts. Throughout the program, the viewing audience will be challenged to figure out which one of the three stories will be revealed to be "proof positive."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?446323</url></doc>
