<plot>The secrets of the Ninjitsu have been jealously guarded for centuries, only once every decade were the scrolls seen at the ritual of the White Ninja. None coveted these secrets more than the evil Shogun. Seizing the opportunity of the ritual he sprang a fiendish trap that destroyed the brotherhood. Except for one. You; the Last Ninja. Your sworn oath is to recover the scrolls, so you travel to the mystical lands of the shogun. Already his guards are mastering the ways of the Ninjitsu. To reach the Shogun's palace you must use all of your weapon-craft and fighting skills as you travel through dangerous wastelands, magnificent gardens and descend into evil dungeons before the final confrontation. You cannot fail, you are the Last Ninja.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569634</url></doc>
