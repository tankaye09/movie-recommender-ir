<plot>Young gay men in Hong Kong. Hoi, Fa, and Kau have been friends since Third Form. They're now young gay adults sharing an apartment. Fa, who writes film scripts, has recently been jilted and is heart-broken. Hoi, who works at an ad agency where he's in the closet, is pursued by Fok May, a female colleague. Kau, effeminate and outgoing, is humiliated in public by his father in front of his brother and sister. He goes on TV to make a plea for acceptance. May learns Hoi is gay and wants to be his friend and his only woman. Under the shadow of AIDS and of prejudice, May and the three guys live out their friendships.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476080</url></doc>
