<plot>The compelling life story of Bill Monroe, the 'Father of Bluegrass' and the only person in history to create his own genre of music. Outcast from his family, young Bill seeks solace in the surrounding Kentucky hills. There he discovers the rhythms and 'ancient tones' that inspire his 'high lonesome' sound. His personal conflict fuels the creation of his music as his pain becomes his passion. Based on the book CAN'T YOU HEAR ME CALLIN' by Richard D. Smith.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092258</url></doc>
