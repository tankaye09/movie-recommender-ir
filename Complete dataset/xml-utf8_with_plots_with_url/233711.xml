<plot>Dante is Satan's greatest warrior. His emotionless soul has helped Satan strengthen his armies. There is only one problem. Dante wants nothing to do with it! For years Dante has searched for a way out of Hell. When he discovers it, Heaven sends their greatest assassin, Rhea Seraph, to stop him. When an Angel falls into Hell they temporarily lose their memory and become extremely vulnerable. Rhea stumbles through a world of damned souls not knowing where she is, or how she got there. Satan dispatches his greatest demons after her. Only to be stopped by Dante. Dante's actions make him a traitor in Hell. Determined to protect Rhea and save his damned soul, Dante takes Rhea to the Gate on top of the highest mountain in Hell. There Dante must battle the Gate Keeper and a newly awakened Rhea.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233711</url></doc>
