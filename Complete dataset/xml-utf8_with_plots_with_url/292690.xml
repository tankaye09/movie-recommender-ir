<plot>This Universal-International "Color Parade" short (U-I production number 8382) was edited from a 1944 two-reeler "Eagle vs. Dragon", which was set in the Mexican outdoors where trainers Daniel and Julo Mannix presented their trained eagles in an exhibition. The highlight of the longer-running two-reeler was the capture of a giant lizard by an eagle, hence the original title, and that comprises most of the footage in this one-reel, ten minute re-edited version.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?292690</url></doc>
