<plot>As his parents split up and his father moves out of the house to live with his girlfriend, Ben has to deal not only with the strains of adolescence but with the breakup of his family. When he and his friends plan what to do on Halloween-they figure they're not too old to go trick-or-treating-they decide to put on gorilla costumes and go dressed as large, hairy apes. Eventually they arrive at Ben's father's new place, where a party is going on. The three gorillas make themselves at home, but after a while Ben "goes ape," crawling on all fours, making apelike grunting noises, and knocking over furniture. As the gorilla metaphor suggests, "Gorilla Boy" is a dark comedy about growing up, feeling different, and being unable to communicate except through clumsy gestures and inarticulate grunts.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?220570</url></doc>
