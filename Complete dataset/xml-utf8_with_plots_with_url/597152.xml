<plot>Having gotten a career in the mainstream media, journalist David Matthews found himself under attack from his friends, who accused him of selling out, "acting white" and playing "their" game. Incensed by this, Matthews looks at black men, claiming they are generally lazy, promiscuous and obsessed with street culture. Looking at the job market, parenthood, schools and other areas, Matthews looks at the subject in depth to back up his claims.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?597152</url></doc>
