<plot>51st State' is a portrait of Antonio, a man caught between the Hispanic ethnicity of his family and the American culture in which he was raised. One day on the subway, Antonio spots a beautiful Latino woman, Paloma, and is awestruck. As Antonio pursues Paloma, he begins to question himself. Is he Hispanic, American, both neither...to what culture, if any, does he belong? Antonio confronts these thoughts in his pursuit of the mysterious and exotic woman on the subway. Will Antonio succeed in his pursuit; or will he lose Paloma...along with his sense of self and cultural identity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006207</url></doc>
