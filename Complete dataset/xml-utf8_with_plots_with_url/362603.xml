<plot>"A very intersting film, showing as it does the one accident of the day. Picture opens with the Black Horse Cavalry, the personal guard of the President-Elect. Then follows the four-horse barouche containing the Presidential party. One of the wheelers falls at this point. Great commotion. Carriage stops, and mounted policemen rush to the rescue. During the slight stop our artists were very close, and excellent pictures of both incoming and outgoing Presidents were obtained."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?362603</url></doc>
