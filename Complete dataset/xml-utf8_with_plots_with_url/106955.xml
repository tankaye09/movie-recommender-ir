<plot>Here we present a most perfect picture photographically, and a highly interesting subject. It was taken with our new circular panorama camera from the elevated position of the railroad track of the Niagara Gorge Railroad, the camera being located on a sharp curve where the road bends to the southeast towards Lewiston. This is the most interesting portion of the rapids, and our circular picture presents a most marvelous panorama of this most dangerous spot. The waters above have been moving in solemn smoothness, as though resting after their terrific leap over Niagara Falls. Here, they rise like maddened horses, and with irresistible force are suddenly lashed into fury indescribable. It was in these rapids that the famous English swimmer, Captain Matthew Webb, on July 14, 1883, in a brave but foolhardy attempt to swim them, lost his life. Here also, the first Maid of the Mist was at times almost entirely submerged in making her memorable and thrilling run to Lake Ontario.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106955</url></doc>
