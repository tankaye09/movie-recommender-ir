<plot>This occasionally funny, often disturbingly brutal cautionary tale is set in Southern California, ground zero for the emerging video culture of modern-day America. Three guys in their early 20s are bent on leading a life of hedonistic abandon. Inspired by the recklessness they see on reality television, they pull pranks on each other and perform death-defying stunts, videotaping each other obsessively as they push the boundaries of safety, common sense and morality. Then Truman, leader of the group, meets a girl named April at a backyard party, and the guys place a wager on whether Truman can seduce her. Faced with the need for proof of his conquest, Truman invites his friends to watch--and videotape--from a nearby closet. Truman is initially rebuffed by April, but this only inspires him to further zeal. He invites her to a romantic weekend getaway in a remote cabin, and she naively accepts the invitation. But there are two things April doesn't know: first, Truman's friend has hidden himself in the cabin to surreptitiously videotape the evening. And second, Truman has no intention whatsoever of taking no for an answer. The gruesome, horrifying night that follows will prove to be the longest night of April's life...and perhaps her last.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603012</url></doc>
