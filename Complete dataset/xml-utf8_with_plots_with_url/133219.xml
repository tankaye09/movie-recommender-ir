<plot>Deadeye is a dark and disturbing thriller in the vein of The Last Broadcast. Documentary filmmaker Rodger Pelem unravels the mystery surrounding Private Lives, a hidden- camera TV show. Created by Robert Van Korda, the show was to be groundbreaking for the time. Hidden cameras would record one couple 24/7 but four weeks into production the show was shut down. All record of its production disappeared and no-one knew of its existence. Until now. Through a mixture of interviews and rare archival footage, Pelem presents a violent and visceral account of what took place and the cover-up that was to follow. This is the true story of Private Lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133219</url></doc>
