<plot>In the mid-1990s, the Worldwide Church of God, which began as a religious cult founded by Herbert W. Armstrong, underwent a massive upheaval. At great personal cost, but with an eye to even greater spiritual gain, they renounced their heretical teachings and embraced biblical, evangelical Christianity; and moved from the bondage of legalism to freedom in the grace of Jesus Christ. The leadership and the laypeople of the transformed Worldwide Church of God tell the incredible story in their own words. Their moving narrative will bring deep encouragement to believers; and those in bondage to cults, legalism, and heretical movements will find hope and good news in this inspiring story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091239</url></doc>
