<plot>"Here is shown a full fledged 'hobo' taken from the real article. He selects a cool, shady place under a tree and proceeds to eat his lunch, which consists of bread, which he no doubt 'swiped' while the dog was out. After satisfying his ravenous appetite, he places his bundle under his head and stretches himself out for a good snooze. The pleasant dream he has is depicted on the screen. The scene changes and a party of ladies and gentlemen are seen sitting in the parlor conversing when the footman enters with a tray on which is found the tramp's card. The master of the house orders him to be ushered in and the 'bum' is introduced and is invited to be seated beside a beautiful lady. He gets gay with her, but she appears to enjoy it, and after enjoying a tete-a-tete luncheon is served of which the 'hobo' partakes with evident relish. The glutton is here seen in his glory. After considerable amusement of this kind is afforded the audience, the scene again changes showing Mr. Tramp peacefully sleeping under the tree and his awakening and finding that it was only a dream, he yawns with a look of disgust and disappointment on his dirty face, plods on his way to the next farm house, where he can beg his next meal. The film is lively, brilliant and full of interest. The scenery is beautiful."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?596756</url></doc>
