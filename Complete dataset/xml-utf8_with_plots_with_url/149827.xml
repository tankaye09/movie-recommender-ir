<plot>In this reality show, various Flemish professionals -only a few in each episode, from somewhat different sets per season- are filmed while giving assistance to "animals in need" (the metaphorical meaning of the Dutch title). Johan is a vet who treats smalls pets; his colleague Heidi specializes is farm animals and horses; in the veterinary department of Ghent university, in Merelbeke, doctors either just treat privately owned animals or do so while teaching college students. In Opglabeek, Sil and his assistants in the provincial center for 'nature assistance' sometimes receive, but often ride out to retrieve, various wild animals in need of medical care, or trapped etc.; marine animals receive similar care in a separate facility. While he usually presents the above items from the studio, the host is usually in the picture on exotic location in game/nature reserves were local rangers -like Steve in South Africa- show their work, which includes tracking and other zoological research.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?149827</url></doc>
