<plot>"This is a most lively picture and a very popular subject. A man and a woman are seen dancing a number of fancy figures, and, after a turn or two, she suddenly leaps on the table, presenting her dainty foot, which he kisses. He appears to enjoy the act, for he chucks her under the chin and repeats the operation. An excellent film; full of life."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394132</url></doc>
