<plot>1940. Los Angeles. Laura Newlin was a normal girl, apart from the fact that her father was a mobster. A smuggler of creative sorts. As the times get harder, Big Jim Newlin starts to run out of options. Laura tries become part of the business, lending her fresh ideas, but because she is a girl, Newlin overlooks her, literally throwing her ideas away and shutting her out. Fed up, Laura decides to make her father see her abilities. She hooks up with private eye Mike Callahan, a thug with a lusty eye, to do her will for a certain chunk of change. The kidnapping, escape, and hideaway all go according to plan, but not quite how Laura expects.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123990</url></doc>
