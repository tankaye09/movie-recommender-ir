<plot>On a sunny day, a man driving alone stops at a red light and, as men will do, starts to pick his nose. He's working it when a woman pulls to a stop in the lane next to him. She's horrified by his behavior, but can't look away. He gets something and pulls. To his delight and her disgust, it's long and green. But, now that it's on his finger, he has a whole new challenge: getting rid of it. He proceeds to his destination. Is he now a captive of his viscous prize?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545191</url></doc>
