<plot>The Christian right has taken over the US government, abortion is illegal, and a civil war looms between the red and blue states. Despite the chaos all around him, all Matthew wants out of life is fame, money and women. He's a homeless performance artist who comes to town with nothing but attitude, a sharp wit, and a chip on his shoulder. With the help of self-destructive mentor Jack, Matthew works out his act, which consists of pissing off religious conservatives. Meanwhile, he chases after Jane, an exotic dancer with a lot of issues. His new love interest pisses off his jealous ex-girlfriend Ruby, who makes life complicated for them with her passive aggressive rages. A homeless buddy who can't get laid, a Wiccan with a grudge, an unexpected pregnancy, and a religious fanatic all push Matthew toward his great purpose, to create a new religion and become the messiah of his generation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366851</url></doc>
