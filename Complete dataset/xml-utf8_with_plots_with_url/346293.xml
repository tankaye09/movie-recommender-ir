<plot>The film Luca's Film tells of three friends who leave Milan with the ashes of their friend Luca, who has recently died of AIDS, in their suitcases. This documentary weaves together two narrative threads. On the one hand, it traces the voyage of the three friends to Sera-Me (in India), a mystical site where the ashes will be scattered according to a traditional Buddhist rite. On the other hand, it recounts Luca's past in a piecemeal way, by means of film-memories that form a subjective portrait of the dead friend. "My friend Luca is a funny character. He makes totems and sculptures with objects he finds in abandoned buildings in the neighborhood. He sees treasures where others see merely garbage. That's how come he's always rich, even if he never had a cent" says Anna Jepsen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346293</url></doc>
