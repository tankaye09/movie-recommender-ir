<plot>French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Daniel Lafond goes into the life of wanted terrorist David Belfield, an African American convert to Islam who was born in the United States and allegedly murdered Ali Akbar Tabatabai, a former Iranian ambassador loyal to the deposed Shah of Iran and an outspoken critic of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1980. Belfield, now known as Hassan Abdulrahman, fled to Iran following the murder and has remained there ever since. In this film, Belfield tries to explain and justify his terrorist activity. Lafond also puts forward several conspiracy theories as to who ordered Belfield to kill the former diplomat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034881</url></doc>
