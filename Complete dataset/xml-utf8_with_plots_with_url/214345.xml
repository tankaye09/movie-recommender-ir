<plot>12 half-hour episodes filmed originally covering cases of hauntings around the United Kingdom, Europe and the USA. Almost every episode concentrates on one major story which is presented in a factual and scientific way. Many weeks of research went into forming the series, making it one of (if not the) best documentary series on the subject of the paranormal. This series was made several years before the outburst of similar documentary productions, and is widely regarded as being the king of them all!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214345</url></doc>
