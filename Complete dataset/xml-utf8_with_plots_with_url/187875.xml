<plot>A middle class widow's life is turned upside down when her son is accused in a murder. She runs from pillar to post to get justice for her son but, being caught in the power play of the rich elite, her son is convicted in the murder. When all seems lost, she joins a College of Law (at the age of 45) and earns a law degree. Armed with this degree she fights for her son and wins the appeal, winning his freedom. But the five years in jail have had an effect on the son - he is now rotten inside. When he is again accused in a spurious drugs racket and all the evidence points to him being guilty, the mother has to decide whether to defend him or, knowing he is probably guilty, prosecute him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187875</url></doc>
