<plot>High above New York's Central Park, a truly remarkable event is unfolding. In the midst of this busy city, a bold and daring red-tailed hawk has taken up residence. Affectionately known to locals as "Pale Male," the hawk courts, breeds, and hunts as its devoted urban fans root for its survival. After unexpected perils, triumphs, and tragedies, onlookers gaze in rapt anticipation as the hawk's chicks prepare to take their first tentative flight from a nest on the ledge of a luxury apartment building. Filmed over a six-year period, "Pale Male" is a rare glimpse of the survival techniques of one of nature's great predatory creatures, and a surprising account of the magical relationship humanity can have with nature.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420923</url></doc>
