<plot>While busily engaged at her occupation the washerwoman is annoyed by the mischievous boys, who throw lighted fire-crackers at her from a window nearby. She retaliates by sousing the boys with a convenient piece of wet linen. This enrages the boys, who proceed to deposit a lighted pack in such close proximity to her heels that she is compelled to beat a precipitous retreat, with the tub, suds and clothes in a somewhat inverted order. A side-splitting picture sure to win a laugh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576862</url></doc>
