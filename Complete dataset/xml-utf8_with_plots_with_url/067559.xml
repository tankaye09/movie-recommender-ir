<plot>In front of a dark, secluded house in the suburban hills, a car slowly approaches its empty moon lit street. The anguished driver turns the headlights off and parks his car in the bushes camouflaging himself. He quietly waits in anticipation for his wife and her lover to arrive while holding his 38 caliber gun. He reflects on his life and his marriage as he loads the gun with bullets. This is the night he's been waiting for. Will the jealous husband put an end to his wife's affair? Is murder the only answer to his problems?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067559</url></doc>
