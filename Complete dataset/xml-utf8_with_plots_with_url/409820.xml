<plot>Under the magnificent scenery of the beaches on the Sinai desert - a love story takes place between a female dolphin named Olin and a young deaf and dumb Bedouin fisherman named Abdalla. This random acquaintance developed into a deep and emotionally involved relationship during which Abdalla, who never spoke a word' now speaks fluently and Olin, in a miraculous way, gave birth to a baby dolphin. Rumors of this unique relationship and of Olin's therapeutic powers, brought tourists from around the globe to this isolated Bedouin village. Jealousy and greed threaten this special relationship and the social fabric of the village conservative Bedouin tradition. Will this turn into being a 'Gift of God' or is it 'God's way to test human greed'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409820</url></doc>
