<plot>This is a post-war (1946) filmed version of "Meet Your Navy," a 15 minute WWII radio program which originated on Chicago radio station WLS during the war and was carried nation wide on the NBC Blue (later ABC) Network. Featured in the film are the Navy Orchestra conducted by Joseph Johnson, the 100 man Navy Chorus with Robert Extrum as soloist, a double quartet of African-American sailors, a comedy group of five sailors known as The Buccaneers who perform a novelty song in the style of Spike Jones, and a sentimental duet sung by Jack Kilty and Gloria Brochman. Durward Kirby, better known in the 50s and 60s as the television side kick of Gary Moore, is the host/announcer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382496</url></doc>
