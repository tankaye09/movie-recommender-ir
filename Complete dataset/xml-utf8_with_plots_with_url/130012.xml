<plot>Woody is given an extra ticket for the school carnival, and since he has been lusting after the virginal Ann for quite some time, decides to ask her to go with him. However, despite--or possibly because of--his name, poor Woody hasn't the slightest idea of what to do on a date. The narrator, who unfortunately for Woody has Ann's best interests at heart, takes him through several situations that may come up on the date, and gives him instructions on what to do for whatever may arise, thereby ensuring that Ann remains untouched by human hands and that Woody remains frustrated and horny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130012</url></doc>
