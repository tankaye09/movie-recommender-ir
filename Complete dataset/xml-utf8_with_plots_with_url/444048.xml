<plot>Three young, single women became roommates in a most unusual way. Tracy was a shy, trusting English teacher who left her fianc√© when she found out he had been married twice before and that one of his ex-wives was his sexy business partner. What she salvaged, however, was a fabulous Manhattan penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park. Tony, the owner of the apartment, a globetrotting friend of her almost husband, had given it to them for a year, rent free, as a wedding present. Apparently he was a little forgetful, having also loaned to the apartment to Georgy, a recently widowed English princess (and former showgirl) who had moved to the States while her late husband's children fought with her attorney over his will. Since Georgy had no friends in New York, she was more than happy to share the huge apartment with Tracy. The third 'princess' was Tracy's longtime roommate and best friend, Melissa, an outspoken, stereotypical Jewish American who sold cosmetics at a department store.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?444048</url></doc>
