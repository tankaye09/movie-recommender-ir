<plot>Using the documentary medium, the director confronts an influential figure from his past. Having been born with a limp, he was habitually joined by his father on school excursions. In junior high, however, one of his teachers promised him he could take part in the school trip unsupervised. She finally changed her mind, leaving him crying on the pavement - and feeling, for the first time in his life, like cripple. A decade afterwards, he decides to meet the teacher and to confront her about the day - hoping this will allow him to leave it behind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233968</url></doc>
