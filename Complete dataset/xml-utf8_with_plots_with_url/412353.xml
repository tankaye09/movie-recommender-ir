<plot>Dee Dee is having another sale to save up money for fashion school. Erik is an Ebay entrepreneur looking for a good find to turn around and sell, dragging his girlfriend Kayla along on the search. Harold is on the hunt for another pocket-sized trinket to add to his collection. Donna and Gladys take time from practicing in their band to get up at the crack of dawn to have first pick at sales. Eleanor steps down from Beverly Hills to be among the common folk in the hopes of finding a bargain, with her incompetent assistant Charles in tow. The City Official lays down the law about posting yard sale "advertisements" on public property. The common ground that brings this motley crew together is a yard sale, where one man's trash is another man's treasure... and anything can happen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412353</url></doc>
