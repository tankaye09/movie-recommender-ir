<plot>This minimalist short film depicts the last days of the famous film-icon of the 1920's, Rudolph Valentino. Having unsuccessfully undergone an operation to remove appendicitis Valentino develops peritonitis and slips into coma. While in the depths of his subconscious, Valentino has surrealistic visions of the last days of his life. Though he is passionately idolized by millions of women around the world, he is deeply unhappy in his private life. Valentino is deeply and hopelessly in love with his wife, who does not reciprocate his feelings. Though he has been dubbed "The Great Lover" and "The Sheik", he becomes submerged in obscurity and loneliness during his life. As he sees images from his life flash before him, he understands that fate, having given him fame and glory, has also taken from him the dearest and most important things in the life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130679</url></doc>
