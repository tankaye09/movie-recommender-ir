<plot>An elderly woman is waiting to catch an omnibus. As she sees it approaching, she stands in the road and waves her umbrella to get the driver's attention. When she realizes that he is not going to stop, she pulls on the horses' reins to try to stop the vehicle. This initiates a heated battle of wills between her and the occupants of the omnibus.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516472</url></doc>
