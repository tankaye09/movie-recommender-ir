<plot>Never before has an astronaut spoken up - about the faults and tragedies of his life, about the achievements and experiences of man in space: Story Musgrave invites us on an emotional journey around a human being exiled between Earth and weightlessness. Astronaut of six space flights, poet, surgeon, chemist, computer specialist and father of six children. Did this ultimately uprooted man find his place here on Earth? He is a metaphor for search and evolution, for love and loneliness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516851</url></doc>
