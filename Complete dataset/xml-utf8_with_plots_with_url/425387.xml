<plot>At the opening of this scene the tomb is discovered, and immediately there enters Nicodemus, followed by Joseph and the mourning women. The men are carefully carrying the body of our Saviour and as they enter the tomb Mary, the mother of Jesus, faints and falls into the arms of Mary Magdalene. Joseph and Nicodemus having placed Him inside the tomb, are seen coming out, and immediately the great stone is rolled before the sepulcher, and, weeping, they depart, leaving Him therein.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425387</url></doc>
