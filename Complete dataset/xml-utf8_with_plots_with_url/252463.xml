<plot>Another bogus title from The Silent Short Film Working Papers by Richard E. Braff. There is no documentation of any film bearing this title ever being produced or distributed at this time. Either production may have been suspended before completion, or else the title may have been changed before final release.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252463</url></doc>
