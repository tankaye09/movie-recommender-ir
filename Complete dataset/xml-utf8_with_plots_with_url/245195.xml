<plot>Hooligan is traveling from New York to Boston, walking the ties. An express train is approaching in the distance. As it draws nearer and passes Hooligan stops to wave his hat. Suddenly he looks around and makes a wild spring down the embankment, and just as his coat-tails disappear a train thunders by in the opposite direction over the very spot where he had been standing. As it disappears in a cloud of dust, Hooligan limps painfully up the embankment and shakes his fist at the train.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245195</url></doc>
