<plot>For Lee Soo Yun life in America was supposed to be a dream come true. She married a wealthy former Navy pilot, Alan Morrison, and was able to bring her half sister Mi Sun to Boston for college. But the dream quickly became a nightmare when Alan's overbearing father, Bill, pushes him into graduate studies under a revolutionary political science professor named A. G. Oxman. Alan grows uneasy, as Oxman's classes become more a call to revolution than an educational experience. Alan's problems with school seem to end when Oxman commits suicide...but in truth they have just begun. Oxman had detailed a number of crimes committed by the quasi-third party Preservation in the name of isolationism that would eventually end in ethnic cleansing in America. With Preservations sights firmly set on Soo Yun and Mi Sun, Alan employs the help of his former Navy buddy now FBI agent, Max Guzman. Will they uncover the secrets of Preservation and restore peace to their lives and their beloved city of Boston?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659209</url></doc>
