<plot>"This is a sight to behold. The film shows in detail how the men clean and fire the immense Hotchkiss gun, a weapon capable of great destruction. When you look at this film you see the tools our sailor boys used to destroy the entire Spanish fleet and enabled us to boast that, though we were not prepared for war, the Yankee is ever equal to the task set before him. This is a most excellent subject."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108444</url></doc>
