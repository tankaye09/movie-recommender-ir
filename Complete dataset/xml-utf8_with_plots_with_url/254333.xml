<plot>A man who's about sixty is walking along one of his native town's streets. Youth memories are being called back to his mind by the late afternoon's heat and summer light. When he was young he used to see a girl he fell in love with. This physical and mental walk ends up in a church's sacristy: he has become a priest to get over the grief for the loss of his beloved, who met with a fatal accident at an early age.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?254333</url></doc>
