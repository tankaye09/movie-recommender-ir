<plot>Taken at the Mid-Lent Carnival at Nice, France, 1903. In this picture we present a scene which is unsurpassed by anything of its kind in the world. Thousands of people take part in this festival. The various costumes, grotesque figures, and masks, and the magnificent floats, make the picture a scene of remarkable interest. The variety of effects shown in the procession are such as will long be remembered by those fortunate enough to have seen it. The film is sure to please the most fastidious and prove a winner from start to finish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445502</url></doc>
