<plot>Ashley always had a tough time finding the right guy. She just met her new boyfriend Richard a few days ago. Upon spending the night together, Richard asks if he can stay at her house for the day. She agrees as long as he doesn't go snooping around through her personal things. And she asks him for one small favor, to take out the garbage. Richard proves less than responsible, disregarding Ashley's requests and before long he's taking advantage of the situation. When a mysterious package arrives, Richard's curiosity becomes the ultimate temptation. What happens then is a reminder of why you shouldn't forget about Trash Day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?616491</url></doc>
