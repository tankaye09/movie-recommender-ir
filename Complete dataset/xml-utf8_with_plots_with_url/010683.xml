<plot>After a 13-year imprisonment in Hong Kong, Mong Fu returns to Thailand to discover that his girlfriend had died and had left him a daughter, Ploy. With the help of Sister Mioko, a caretaker for orphans, Fu and Ploy begin the long hard road to know each other. However, a Thai boxing promoter tells the truth about why Fu went to prison. It turns out that Fu, who is a former kickboxer himself, killed a kickboxing champion outside the ring. In an attempt to bring honor back, Fu challenges the current champion in a fight. Meanwhile, a relationship begins to ensue between Fu and Sister Mioko.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010683</url></doc>
