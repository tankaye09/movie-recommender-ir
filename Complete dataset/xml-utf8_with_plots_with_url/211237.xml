<plot>Shyam (Sachin) is an orphan, and earns a living by singing and dancing at special occasions. One day the family Durga babu (Manhar Desai), his wife Ganga (Urmilla Bhatt), comes across Shyam, and decide to take him with them to their house. There Shyam meets with their daughter, Radha (Sarika), and as a result Radha slowly falls in love with Shyam. Shyam is naive and thinks that Radha just wants to be friends. In his eyes, Shyam wants to be a free person, not tied down to anyone or anything, and would like to spend the rest of his life wondering, singing, and dancing. When Shyam finds out that the family intend to marry him to Radha, he likens his plight to that of a caged bird, and flees, breaking Radha's heart. Will Shyam ever return? What impact will this have on the family?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?211237</url></doc>
