<plot>This film takes place around the mid to late 1800's in Greece and the young rising star, Aliki Vougiouklaki, plays the lead as a love struck girl named Kroustalo. She's in love with Liako and he loves her too but Kroustalo's mother, Kira Stathena, is against the romance and denies the village matchmaker's proposition to arrange a marriage. Kira Stathena needs to find someone well off for her daughter because Liako is poor. Stathena then inquires about Mitro, a mature and rich man who gave Kroustalo his golden cross from around his neck. Mitro gave Kroustalo his cross because she reminded him so much of his long lost first love, Maro. When Kira Stathena meets the man she realizes that he was the one she fell in love with when she was young and he never recognized her as she had aged. Liako finds out about the matchmaking and threatens Mitro, who had once saved his life. Mitro who was not in love with Kroustalo decides to marry her out of spite because Liako was so disrespectful.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?405250</url></doc>
