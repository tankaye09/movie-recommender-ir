<plot>He's got more opening lines than Henny Youngman. He's as hopelessly persistent as Disco. He's struck out more times than the Cubs. He's Leisure Suit Larry, the winningest loser in computer game history, maybe in the history of the world. And he's back in the sixth installment of Al Lowe's singles scene set-up, an epic saga of absurdity, ingenuity, and raw, unbridled rejection. As a consolation prize for his humiliating performace on a TV dating show, Larry wins two weeks at the fabulous La Costa Lotta Spa (first prize - one week!). Surrounded by nine smart, savvy, beautiful women, Larry will surely meet Ms. Right. Right? Wrong! Help Larry overcome all the odds and experience True Love. Save him from dozens of hilariously hopeless encounters. We don't care how you do it, but whatever you do, deliver this male! It's prime Leisure Suit Larry, the most laughable loveless loser to ever grace the small screen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?328969</url></doc>
