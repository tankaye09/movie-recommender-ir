<plot>A funny and poignant portrait of Jeff Shames' successful efforts to come to terms with his stutter and his family's legacy of denial. Jeff's father is intolerant of and rageful towards his son's imperfections, while his mother never discusses her own childhood stutter. As a teenager, Jeff turns to alcohol and drugs to mask his shame, and eventually marries an alcoholic who interacts with the outside world for him. After his wife gets sober, Jeff discovers the stuttering self-help community and embarks on a healing journey of sobriety, self-acceptance and forgiveness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510732</url></doc>
