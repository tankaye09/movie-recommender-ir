<plot>Why do the vast majority of Latina, African American and Asian American women in the U.S. fail to vote? Individuals share their personal histories and reasons for avoiding the political process, as well as their struggles and triumphs; Congresswoman Barbara Lee, United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta, Civil rights activist Aileen Hernandez and internment camp survivor Margaret Ouye. Hear the voices of those busy raising families, working multiple jobs, and constrained by time, culture, family, history, language, and fear of political engagement. Join women in their homes and offices as they recount the elements that affect the way they think about politics and how they turn out to vote.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178654</url></doc>
