<plot>In July 2005, the World Masters Games hosted the first women's basketball team over the age of 65. To qualify for the Masters you just need to be in the right age bracket and "still breathing." However, many former Olympians enter and the competition is serious. This documentary follows the "Retreads" as they train for the Games through to the final competition where, alone in their category, they find they must play against three younger, stronger and faster teams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580269</url></doc>
