<plot>"Kid Talk" was promoted as "family-friendly" programming in the early 1970's. Actually, "Kid Talk" ran opposite ABC's "Juvenile Jury." Then, programming by the only networks in that day, NBC, ABC, and CBS, made attempts to "recover" "family-programming" from the 1950's and the 1960's; however, they tried to accomplish this by promoting the "kid's point-of-view," perhaps, to attempt to divert the public's attention from the more important issues of the day. Ultimately, neither "Kid Talk" nor "Juvenile Jury" fared well in ratings, primarily, due to the television viewers' other more obvious interests at that time (i.e., Watergate and Vietnam) and because in that day, the opinion of "kids," truly, was not welcome (unlike today, then, "kids" were seen and not heard and that carried-through to television programming); consequently, both networks cancelled their respective "kid host" talk shows. It was not until a production hosted by Bill Cosby in the 2000's that the format reoriginated. (That series, too, did not fare well.)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290933</url></doc>
