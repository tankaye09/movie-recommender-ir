<plot>Eight lives, eight stories, cross each other in the underground "Wu Wei Club" in Urumqi. Hong Kong owner Donnie Lau keeps a silent and watchful eye over the proceedings of this 24/7 fishbowl of observation. All who enter become unknowing participants in an artistic fusion, orchestrated by Donnie, culminating in one single night where eight perfect ingredients combine to unveil the very soul of the world. Drawing from the eight trigrams (Pa Gua) of the I Ching, the Taoist 'bible', these stories unfold in their interaction, creating the rich fabric of reality as we know it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166692</url></doc>
