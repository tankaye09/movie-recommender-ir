<plot>Madison is floating through her life: going to work, spending time with her friends, talking to her mother. The only catch, she never really sees or feels anything that is going on around her because she is caught up with her own internal struggles and emotions, all because she cannot get over her brother's suicide. Her friend Leo is witnessing her downward spiral, his concern growing. Madison resists him and everyone else who tries to intervene in her isolated state of being, and when she is pushed too far, she ventures to the river where her brother jumped to his death. When the river tries to claim Madison, she is forced to step out of her stagnant existence and fight to keep what little life she has left.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351205</url></doc>
