<plot>Wonderful World A city without homeless people is not really a city. Filthy bums, irritating bawlers, dishevelled characters, they enrich our existence in a way we don't really comprehend. Wonderful World immerses into the heads of people who have fallen out of our welfare state. Vagabond Jan Dominique approaches everyday as a beautiful day, even when he is chased out of his 'home' by bulldozers. Saskia is homeless for 15 years and former physician. Her literary knowledge helps her to survive. The love elderly Lucy and Herman feel for each other makes us envious. Wonderful World is a visual and musical tribute to individuals who dangle on the edge of oblivion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376539</url></doc>
