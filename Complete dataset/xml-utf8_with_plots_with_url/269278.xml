<plot>Enjoy your Mercedes but don't forget the tranquility of riding in a canoe. Every person has an Island Girl within them, a naturalistic sense of being, competent enough to survive off of what the Earth provides. Many of us fall into the clutches of materialism and synthetic beauty and stray further and further away from this sense of naturalism that dwells within us. A select few of us possess a well balanced sense of being where materialism is a non-threatening force to the preservation of naturalism. Many find this equalibrium difficult to achieve. Society's majority are raised to consume to the point of consuming themselves. Island Girl reminds us to pay attention to the entrapment of materialism before it is too late.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269278</url></doc>
