<plot>This film compiles T.S.O.L. performances from both the Flipside and Target Video vaults, circa 1983. Featuring Jack Grisham (Vocals), Ron Emory (Guitar), Mike Roche (Bass), and Francis Gerald Barnes (Drums), this footage defines T.S.O.L. as the founding fathers of vicious grindcore. Grisham's snarling vocals and menacing stage presence are as fierce as can be, as the band plows through 14 anthems such as "Superficial Love," "Abolish Government/Silent Majority," "Darker My Love," "Code Blue" and more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?527574</url></doc>
