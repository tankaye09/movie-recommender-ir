<plot>In this film "Shadows in the Wall" a painterly style is used to tell the story of a cup through its birthing process, its fear of change, and its final transition to a different stage of life. The intent of this film is to make the viewer think about the human condition of birth, fear of the unknown and death and the possibility that death, as birth, is the portal to a new stage of being.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?489977</url></doc>
