<plot>Some people travel to leave. Some people travel to arrive. Some people travel to get their feet off the ground - and some to never have to put them back down. Afraid of settling down at the wrong time or place, Embla continues her never ending travels around the world. As she encounters new and different places and people she fantasizes about what life would be like if she stopped. And then one day she has to choose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?616742</url></doc>
