<plot>A medical student from Vienna is sent to the provinces in the 18th century to stop a pox epidemic and the vampire hysteria that threatens the kingdom. Armed with a new vaccine that makes people worse before they get better, he uses his scientific knowledge to try and counter their superstition and calm the hysteria, only to encounter a diabolical nemesis in the person of the local count's medicus, who will do anything in order to get what he wants. The young man quickly grows up when he falls deeply in love with one of the girls in the village who is naturally immune, and is forced to put himself in harm's way in order to save all of them from the man who is the real vampire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385659</url></doc>
