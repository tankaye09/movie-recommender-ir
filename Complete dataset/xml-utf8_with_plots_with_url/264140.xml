<plot>Indecision was based on the ideals of three young men in search of enlightenment and a rationale to answer the questions that society proposes of confusion, which constantly lurks on the minds of young adults and especially those who are in college. In essence, the purpose of their film was to demonstrate the confusion and questions of life that can occur to a young adult in the midst of a conquest for perfection in life. As the short narration unravels, the results illustrate that each individual in the world must find their own world of perfection and reasons as to why they do the things they do in order to control the pressures that society places upon them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264140</url></doc>
