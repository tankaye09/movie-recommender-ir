<plot>In the medieval town of Kampen a young woman is cast off by her parents and has to survive on her own outside the town walls. There she meets Jan van Schaffelaar, an adventurer and social critic. It is the beginning of a tumultuous, Bonny and Clyde-like love affair. The couple form their own Utopian community that comes under threat of the growing feud between the Hoeken and Kabeljauwen and leads to a dramatic climax on the top of a church tower in Barneveld.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231299</url></doc>
