<plot>Rajesh Narain lives a poor lifestyle in a small town in British India along with his brother, Brijesh, Bhabi, and a niece, Munni. He attends college and has a sweetheart in wealthy Kamini Sinha, and both hope to get married someday. While Brijesh is actively involved in trying to force their oppressors (the British) to leave India, poetic Rajesh has no interest in politics. Things change when Brijesh gets killed and Rajesh decides to avenge his death by actively becoming involved with freedom fighters so much so that he quickly becomes a thorn on the Britisher's side and orders are issued to apprehend him - dead or alive. He even spurns Kamini, who ends up getting married to a man of her dad's choice. While on the run from the law, assisted by a Pathan truck-driver, Sher Khan, Rajesh finds shelter in the house of his childhood friend, newly-wed Superintendent of Police, Dheeraj Kumar - not knowing that he will soon be confronted by an embittered Kamini, who is the bride of Dheeraj; Sher Khan, who has been arrested and is being tortured may soon reveal Rajesh's hiding place, and from Dheeraj himself when he finds out that his best friend loves his bride.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442300</url></doc>
