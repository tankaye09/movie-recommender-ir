<plot>Gohar plays a dutiful wife whose husband refuses to take his share of the domestic responsibilities, claiming that he has enough problems at the office. Frustrated with his housewifely spouse, he takes up with a dancing-girl. The wife is spurred into an active social life, discovering a world beyond the confines of the home. The tale sought to tell modern women that they owed it to their husbands to be more than domestic drudges.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225129</url></doc>
