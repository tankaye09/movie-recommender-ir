<plot>After the first day of school, concerns arise that Christian Byers, a little boy in Emma's third grade class has something terribly wrong with him. She shares her concerns with Brian, her fiance, while house hunting and discussing wedding plans, but is not taken too seriously. Though her suspicions grow, the reluctance of those around her to agree with, or even listen to what she's "concocting" comes to a head when Emma pays a visit to Christian's home for a discussion with his father. Mr. Byers appears to be a gun toten, sexist asshole who does not accept Emma's pessimistic view of his son (who happens to know how to use a firearm) When Brian with some fellow teachers arrives back home after happy hour appetizers, he finds a bloody shirt leading to Emma, gun in hand, sitting with a beaten, tied-up Christian. She strong-arms Brian into helping her "dispose" of young Christian in the woods behind their newly purchased home, then returns to her previously happy life. Brian isn't so lucky.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291858</url></doc>
