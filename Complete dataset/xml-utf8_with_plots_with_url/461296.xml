<plot>Resurrection is a small, unassuming rural town in Kentucky. It is a place known only for one peculiar attribute: a string of mysterious disappearances stretching back to the turn of the century. Locals believe that the legendary ghost of a woman named Mary Bregavy may be haunting the town, looking for suitors to meet her in the realm beyond. A local innkeeper seems to have all the answers, but is his account of Mary true, or just more local folklore? A burnt-out tabloid writer goes in search of the legend and ends up becoming a key player in a story he could only dream of inventing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?461296</url></doc>
