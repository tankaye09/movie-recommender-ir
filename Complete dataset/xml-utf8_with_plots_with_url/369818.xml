<plot>A weekly half-hour music infotainment show that ran for more than 52 weeks, between April 1989 and April 1990, with Dick Nieskens as presenter and writer. Each show developed a theme with humorous sketches, celebrity interviews and location shooting. For example, the episode "Resuscitated Rockers" showed then-current videos from classic groups of the 60's and 70's, with Dick aging in each presentation link, until he was a sleepy, bald geriatric at the end of the show. "Take the Rap" featured an interview with Run DMC and had Dick playing all three members of his own rap group. The series welcomed Roberta Flack, Tim Rice, Michael Brecker, Cyndi Lauper, the Pet Shop Boys, and more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?369818</url></doc>
