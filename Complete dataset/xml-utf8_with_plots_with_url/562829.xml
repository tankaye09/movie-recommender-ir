<plot>On a 25th birthday trip to Mexico, WASP-y Beverly Hills yuppie Larry McCann discovers he was actually born in Mexico. In an effort to get in touch with his Mexican roots, he embraces the Mexican culture and falls in love with an immigrant named Vanessa Valdez. Then Larry discovers Vanessa's father, Octavio, is Larry's employee and hates Larry's guts. Octavio makes Larry jump through hoops to prove his love is sincere, and Larry tries to win over the Valdez family and simultaneously fulfill his destiny as The Gringo Baby.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?562829</url></doc>
