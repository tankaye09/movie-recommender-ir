<plot>Dika Newlin is a 75-year-old singer in the Richmond, Virginia, area and is something of a cult figure for her what may charitably be called "off-key" singing, whether in a rock band or a country band and often accompanies herself on the guitar or the kazoo. Included are interviews with Dika herself and friends and colleagues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150151</url></doc>
