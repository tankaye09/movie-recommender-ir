<plot>A young Men's Magazine Journalist seeks out more than he has become. His most recent project revolves around a group of women who discuss sex for a living and call themselves licensed therapists. His dream job is to work for the Daily Tribune under supervision of Vance; the brash, arrogant CEO type who underpays his staff and still thinks everyone loves him. Has this finally become a realistic vision? Along the way we meet his roommate Wyatt who is a very dedicated street impersonator who takes himself way too seriously. We also meet his Barista, Summer; a sassy, confident and sophisticated in her behavior. Do these people he meets along the way share his frustrations or epitomize them?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335504</url></doc>
