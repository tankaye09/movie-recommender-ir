<plot>The Editor and owner of a popular publication called 'Meri Zabaan" goes missing, believed dead, as he, Vikram Singh (Vinod Mehra) attempted to expose some big-wigs, leaving his young son, Krishna, and wife to fend for themselves. While his wife loses her mind, and is placed in a mental institute, his son grows up to a do-gooder (Mithun Chakraborty). Baby (Farha) a petty thief and bar dancer, falls for Krishna, but he shuns her. He, however, revises his opinion when he comes to know that she is the key behind his mother's mental state of mind. She assists him in curing his mother, and he, in turn, finds her biological father, the rich and wealthy, Ranjeet Mehra (Ranjeet). Then Krishna finds out that his dad is alive, in prison. He meets him and then gets involved in a deceitful plot whereby even his lady love turns against him, and no one is what they claim to be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366451</url></doc>
