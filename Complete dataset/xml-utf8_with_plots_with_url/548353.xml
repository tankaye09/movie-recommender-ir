<plot>This film created a demand for itself unknown in the moving picture business. We were the only firm who made a reproduction thereof, and the supply was by no means equal to the demand for the first two weeks after the catastrophe occurred. It is a remarkable picture, full of excitement from start to finish. Of course, the picture opens with a spiritual fire run, followed by one of the most thrilling life rescues ever witnessed, after which the fire laddies are seen on the roofs of adjoining buildings throwing streams of water on the burning structure, and ends with the street scene black with smoke. A very effective picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548353</url></doc>
