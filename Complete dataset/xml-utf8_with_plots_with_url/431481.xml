<plot>A photographer on the stage attempts to photograph the audience and is almost driven wild by those who will not pose correctly.

He is so incensed that he hurls pieces of the stage furniture into the audience until one of them clambers up on the stage and pummels him until he is subdued.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431481</url></doc>
