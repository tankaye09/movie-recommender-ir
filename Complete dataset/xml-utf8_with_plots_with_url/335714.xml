<plot>Life for Daniel questions the role of medicine in a child's fight against leukemia. The drama lifts the lid on the NHS and takes a trip down the corridors of power where things are not always as clear cut as they seem. Jane Herman is forceful, thoughtful, and intelligent, a far cry away from the image of Christian Scientists held by the teachers at her son Daniel's school. When they rush Daniel into hospital concerned about the bruising on his arms, she's incandescent with rage. As she fights for the right to decide what's best for her child when doctors diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukemia, she embarks upon an emotionally crippling journey. Confronted by bureaucracy and paranoia, she struggles to prove that there are alternatives, and that a mother will go to any lengths to save her son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335714</url></doc>
