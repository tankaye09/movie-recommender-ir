<plot>A brave fighter and brilliant student of the art of war, Kieran Selkirk is summoned to a clandestine meeting on the eve of the American Revolution. There he finds none other than Benjamin Franklin, who reveals that the British have asked Catherine the Great to provide twenty thousand Russian soldiers to help put down the resistance in America. Selkirk's mission is straightforward, if hardly simple: he is to travel to Russia disguised as a British mercenary, offer his services to the Tsarina in her fight against the Cossacks that threaten her throne, and convince her not to join the British in their war with America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?576068</url></doc>
