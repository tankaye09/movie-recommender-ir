<plot>Glory, who grew up in Greenhills Ohio, worries that her town is threatened by demolition and unsuitable redevelopment. She travels to the other two "greenbelt towns" built by the Roosevelt Administration as affordable housing for the working poor, to find out how they are surviving into the 21st century. She interviews residents and town leaders, attends festivals, and learns that each one of the New Deal towns faced challenges that it met one way or another. She fears that her town is losing its historic character and humanistic plan. A case study in the history of city planning, architectural preservation, community participation and democratic involvement, and the attachment to home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222716</url></doc>
