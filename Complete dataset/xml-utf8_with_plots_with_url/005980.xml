<plot>5 THEN 4 is a story about Islamic extremist ideology seen through the eyes of 5 young school children and the struggle that many Muslim youth face, to love the rest of the world or to hate it. The film introduces 5 young school friends who meet together everyday for lunch. This day, they all bring a book and picture representing their way of life and are confronted with the jarring image one of them brought. The children retreat in fear and disapproval, leaving their friend alone to watch them play joyfully and question her own beliefs.</plot><plot>5 THEN 4 is a story about Islamic extremist ideology seen through the eyes of 5 young school children and the struggle that many Muslim youth face, to love the rest of the world or to hate it.
