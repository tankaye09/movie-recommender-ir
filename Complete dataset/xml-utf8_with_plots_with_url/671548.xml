<plot>Zoenen of Schoppen is about the eleven-year-old boy, Bruno, who tries his very best to connect with his classmates at his last years' school camp. At first Bruno doesn't want to go on camp at all, but when he decides to go, he gives one's all for the next 72 hours, trying to connect with his peers. Bruno believes that when you are doing something, you ought to do it right. But as good as his intensions are, they always come out wrong, time after time. Bruno is a sweet boy, but irritating because of his social clumsiness. He was never taught the 'unwritten rules of behaviour' so he cut's one's own throat constantly. Through the eyes of Bruno we see how difficult and lonely it can be to fit in when you don't understand the rules. Even more when you try - just like Bruno - to be accepted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?671548</url></doc>
