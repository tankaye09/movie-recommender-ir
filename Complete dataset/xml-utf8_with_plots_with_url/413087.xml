<plot>Remy (Tom Gallant) has been sitting in the same hotel room drinking martinis and smoking cigarettes since the 60s, desperately trying to compose a follow up to his chart-topping love ballad Will I See You? On Christmas Eve, Remy is visited by a mysterious man (Rejean Cournoyer) who arrives to collect on a bad debt. After Remy's pleading, the man agrees to give Remy one more week to get his affairs in order. Soon after, Izzy (Andrew Bush), a noisy young musician who lives in the room below him, literally comes crashing into Remy's life. The two bond over their mutual love of song-as well as the pain and regret Remy feels about Madeline (Cassie MacDonald/Jennifer Overton), the woman he lost in the blind pursuit of his musical dreams. Will Remy be able to look inside himself-and his past-with the assistance of his new young friend and find the inspiration for another hit before the debt collector returns on New Year's Day?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?413087</url></doc>
