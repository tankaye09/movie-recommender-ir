<plot>Rahul Mehta lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his widower dad, Tusshar, in Mumbai, and comes from a business family. His father has arranged his marriage with Meghna, who also lives a wealthy lifestyle along with her parents, who approve of Rahul. But when Meghna finds out that Rahul really loves Saveen, the daughter of Imran Jafri from Ahmedabad, she decides to step aside and let the lovers be together. Rahul offers to escort Saveen back home by Sabarmati Express with her dad's permission. At Godhra railway station, their train is set afire by Islamic extremists, and they take shelter at Payal's, a journalist with NTA, who is the girlfriend of Rahul's friend, Adarsh, also a journalist.
