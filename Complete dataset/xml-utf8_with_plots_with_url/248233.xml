<plot>This is a street scene in Philadelphia in which a Rube and his girl are walking, "seeing the sights." Rube becomes inquisitive, and leaving Mandy for a moment, he walks across the track and stands directly in the path of a fast approaching trolley car, which scoops him up in the fender. This film is extremely funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248233</url></doc>
