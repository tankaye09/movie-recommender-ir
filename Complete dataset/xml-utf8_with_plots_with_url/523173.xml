<plot>In the heart of Brooklyn new life grows. Sela is pregnant. Sam has managed to avoid the question by catering to what she wants to do. But the very moment when they ultimately have to decide he withdraws. While he hovers between a decision and revealing what he feels underneath she begins to press him. He slides around her questions and fights but seems to be crumbling from within. At the final moment he makes his choice but an accident interrupts their decision. The eventual fall-out and final seconds are stunning and haunting as both of these young people are changed forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523173</url></doc>
