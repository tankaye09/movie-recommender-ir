<plot>In the course of their lives most people rarely deal with deafness. So, the day parents are told their child is deaf, the impact can be shattering. Dreams come crashing to the ground. A lot of learning has to happen in a very brief time. What are the options these parents have? Is it possible that their child, with a severe or profound hearing loss, can be taught to talk and to listen? This film shows that a deaf child can learn like all children learn: going to school with the kids next door, joining a baseball team, or playing the violin. They can do almost anything because most deaf children can be taught to speak and to listen. This film shows how extraordinary process takes place. It is called oral deaf education.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159655</url></doc>
