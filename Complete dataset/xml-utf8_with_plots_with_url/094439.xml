<plot>You would think that Amy C. Baker, a suburbanite soccer mom, would be safe from the big-city crime of carjacking. But safety is a delusion: She was shot, for the sake of her car, just a few blocks from her home. What do you say, after months of physical rehab, when given the opportunity to speak to the man who shot you? Amy C. Baker's response to one of life's lessons is not one that you will quickly forget.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?094439</url></doc>
