<plot>Forever Faithful captures the experience that is Vancouver Canucks hockey. The focus is less on the game than the effect of the game. Who are these people who break the mold and lay bare their very soul to support the local hockey team? Who lives in this bastion of tranquility and yet can be found screaming into the night with the unbridled emotion of a prisoner freed? The hockey fans of Vancouver are as diverse as the city's population writ large. There are no stereotypical Canucks fans. They are you, they are me. They are Forever Faithful.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?200623</url></doc>
