<plot>Fortune Files examines what happens to a celebrity's money after they die. This special opens a window into the extraordinary lives and even more extraordinary deaths of four icons - Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and John F. Kennedy Jr. - and investigates the issues that inevitably arise when a celebrity's estate is at stake. The show reveals amazing facts, among them: Kurt Cobain made only $31,000 in 1991, the year Nevermind broke; at the time of his death in 1994, his estate was worth $100 million in future royalties. Over $25 million in legal fees have been spent fighting over ownership of Jimi Hendrix's recordings. And Jim Morrison's estate is controlled by a couple that he had only met a few times. This second installment of Fortune Files will demonstrate that when it comes to celebrity and money, the end is just the beginning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201124</url></doc>
