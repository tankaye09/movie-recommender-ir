<plot>When Woody undertips in a posh restaurant, the waiters immediately throw him out on his ear. Tired of his petty lifestyle, he notices an ad in the paper for a rich woman with a big mansion and lots of food looking for a husband. Of course, he volunteers and is pleased when he overhears the woman's sexy voice on the telephone. Unfortunately, when he meets the lady in person, her sexy voice belies the fact that she is largely unattractive. She chases the unwilling Woody all over her mansion until he, finally, is reluctantly married to her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010365</url></doc>
