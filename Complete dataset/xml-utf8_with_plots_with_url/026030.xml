<plot>Vishal, Sameer Kelkar, and Siddharth Singh are Indian Air Force pilots who have been assigned to handle the latest fighter jets to be used against their enemies, the Pakistanis. While flying several sorties over enemy territory they gain valuable experience and it is this that prepares them to go into enemy territory. Unfortunately for them, they are captured and held in an encampment for war prisoners, treated brutally, and questioned ruthlessly. Despite this, they do not reveal any sensitive information. In this camp they meet several inmates who have been imprisoned since the 1971 war with India, and one of them is Shamsher Singh Shekawat. With him, the trio plan an escape into the night and into the wilderness of the border of no man's land between India and Pakistan - with a ruthless Pakistani Military Commander hot on their tails with instructions to shoot at sight. The foursome know that they may not survive, either the enemy or the wilderness to return to their families and loved ones</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026030</url></doc>
