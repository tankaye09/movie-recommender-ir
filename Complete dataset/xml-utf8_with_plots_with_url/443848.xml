<plot>Here we show the visit of Prince Henry at Lincoln's monument, Chicago, Ill., erected to our great martyred President, Abraham Lincoln. Prince Henry arrives in a carriage accompanied by Robert Lincoln, a prominent attorney of Chicago, Ill., and son of the Illustrious Abraham Lincoln. They alight from the carriage and start immediately for the monument. We regret to state that the great crowd which surrounded Lincoln's monument and which surged in front of our cameras, due to the fact that the police were totally unable to control them, prevented our securing a picture of the actual laying of the wreath, but the arrival of the Prince, accompanied by Robert Lincoln, will undoubtedly prove of sufficient interest to warrant our listing the same. The ending of the picture shows the wreath lying on the monument.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?443848</url></doc>
