<plot>An out-of-work teacher arrives at a deserted-looking school building for an appointment, hoping to land a new teaching job. Little does he know that this will be an interview like none other. The creepy-acting interviewer already knows everything in his portfolio long before he ever arrives, or even thought about applying for the position. As the interview transpires the teacher is repeatedly prompted to tell about certain events in his past. Soon he discovers that the interviewer knows a deep dreadful secret from his last teaching job. The more the teacher tries to explain, the more it becomes obvious that this isn't really a job interview at all. This is an awakening to the realization that the interviewer is altogether someone more horrifying than anyone ever could have imagined. Moreover, the teacher's not actually where he thinks he is. Now, it won't be long before he fully realizes that he's being considered for a position that will yield a lifetime of terror!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219888</url></doc>
