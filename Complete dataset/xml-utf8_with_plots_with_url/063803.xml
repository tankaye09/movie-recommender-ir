<plot>Tim Skold is a Grammy-nominated multi-instrumentalist, writer and producer that has played with Skold, Shotgun Messiah, KMFDM and most recently Marilyn Manson - where his credits include keyboards, synthesizer, bass, guitar and producer of 'The Golden Age of Grotesque' and 'Eat Me Drink Me' albums. Skold gives an intimate behind-the scenes look at his life as a professional musician - including rare photos and video footage. Skold then gives in-depth guitar and bass lessons for how to play "Putting Holes in Happiness" by Marilyn Manson and jams the tracks with Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?063803</url></doc>
