<plot>Speedshop is a magazine-style program that not only appeals to the seasoned automotive enthusiast, but is of interest to the casual viewer as well. South Bay Studios Group in Long Beach, California produces Speedshop both in its studios and on location. The South Bay Studios Group (SBSG) includes: South Bay Studios (link), a state-of-the-art 150,000 square foot studio facility with 12 stages. Also an integral part of the SBSG is Focus on Cars, a premier automotive preparation facility for both print and film productions.  Both of these subsidiaries of South Bay Studios have a very impressive client list within the automotive industry. Speedshop was originally featured on the cable network Speedvision for a number of years. Just recently the successful automotive-themed show was picked up by ShopNBC to anchor its primetime slot on Wednesday nights.  Speedshop is very proud to be apart of ShopNBC's new 2001 fall season of original programming.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509887</url></doc>
