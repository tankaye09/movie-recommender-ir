<plot>Youthful triangles in Hong Kong. Jerry, Cherrie, and Lok are a pop trio, and the boys have agreed not to court Cherrie for the good of the group. Jerry's a feckless playboy, but he falls hard for the beautiful and talented Fonfong; she becomes his roommate as Cherrie looks on. Lok has two women in his life, the young and innocent Man-Yi, and Rachel, a mysterious minx into bondage and sexual excess. Things come to a head when Fonfong has a chance to study in Paris and Rachel takes things a bit far with Lok. It's time for Jerry and Lok to look around: is true love closer at hand? And what about Cherrie, who's been bruised often by Jerry: what will she decide?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054065</url></doc>
