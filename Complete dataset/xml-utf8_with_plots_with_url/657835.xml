<plot>"Windfalls" is a 26-episode 5-minute stop-motion animated TV series. It tells the story of human-like flora characters called Windfalls living in a place called Windfall Land. The episodes deal with things about nature, such as identifying the signs of spring, the dangers of eating deadly nightshade and medicinal properties of certain plants. There are also moral lessons in some of the episodes. For example, one episode teaches us to accept ourselves for who we are. The characters, and almost everything else in this series, are made from real grasses, leaves and flowers, a claim that is expressed during the end credits of alternate episodes. One of the most interesting scenarios in this series is the formation of a Windfall, where the various parts of the Windfall will appear from all corners of the TV screen and gather to form a person-like figure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657835</url></doc>
