<plot>A portrait of a family preparing for a child welfare hearing in Brooklyn. Daniel and Raymond Jacobs have been in the care of their grandmother, Ursula, for seven years, because their mother Kitten is a drug addict. The filmmakers follow them during the period before the hearing: the boys, now in high school and middle school, voice their hopes for their mother's rehabilitation and for a normal life with her. Ursula talks about the responsibility she bears. Kitten enters a residential treatment program. Will she make it, and what choices does the court have?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655676</url></doc>
