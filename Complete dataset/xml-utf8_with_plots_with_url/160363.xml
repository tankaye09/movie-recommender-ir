<plot>Country scenes are ever charming and delightful, and this one will please your fancy. The scene is laid in a beautiful rolling country where waving trees and grass are refreshing to the view. A very pretty subject, full of motion. The farmer and his boy are seen driving the cows to pasture, and the Alderneys are going at a rapid pace through the bars which had been previously let down.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160363</url></doc>
