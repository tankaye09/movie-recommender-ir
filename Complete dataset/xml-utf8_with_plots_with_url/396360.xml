<plot>Nightcrawlers" is a bar - a late-night watering hole. It is a crossroads where people from different walks of life intersect. A chance encounter here can have lasting impact. The city at night is beautiful and mysterious. It is a place brimming with menace - and promise. Devastated by the death of his wife, the city's mayor is on a downward slide. Picking up a beautiful, feisty woman one night, his life and career could further unravel, or - it could be a new beginning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?396360</url></doc>
