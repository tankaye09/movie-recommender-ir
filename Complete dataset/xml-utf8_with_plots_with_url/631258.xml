<plot>This most interesting scene shows the fishermen arriving at the cannery with the boats loaded with their day's catch. The unloading at the cannery, hauling of the fish out of the boats into the canneries, making this a very animated scene, which to Easterners seems incredible as to the amount of fish is daily brought to the canneries.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?631258</url></doc>
