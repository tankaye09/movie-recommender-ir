<plot>Manji's car hire and repair business is failing and matters are made worse when his son, Raj walks out. Manji resorts to sleeping on the premises rather than face going home. He retreats into a Bollywood world of dance and happier times with his wife, Rambai with whom he built the business. In a long dark night of the soul, Manji comes to terms with Rambai's death. She was killed in a car crash which he survived. Manji smashes up the garage which he holds so dear because it contains too many memories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356492</url></doc>
