<plot>We are all interested in the Philippine Islands, and its unruly inhabitants, and this film in particular will give an idea of how these semi-savages prepare for war. In their scanty costume they go through numerous antics, brandishing their deadly spears and uttering unnatural sounds, dancing all the while. These half-civilized men represent the following of the notorious Aguinaldo, the chief of the revolutionists, but who will finally be subdued by the brave American soldier boys now in the Philippine Islands. You want this film, as a star of all war films.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?431199</url></doc>
