<plot>In this film, Gwynne Dyer examines the state of the various Scandinavian nations' foreign relations in the current cold war situation. Specifically, he guides us through their varied attempts at maintaining some form of neutrality between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. For instance, we look at Iceland which has no real military forces while the United States uses the island for their own military needs, Finland with its delicate situation of neutrality while still being a voluntary buffer state for the Soviet Union and Sweden which has true neutrality, but must maintain a vigorous arms industry as a result. With these nations working to stay out dangerous foreign entanglements, we see the arguement that they could unite along with Canada to create northern neutral zone that could reduce the risk of a global war that would destroy them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230360</url></doc>
