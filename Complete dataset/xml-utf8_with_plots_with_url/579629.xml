<plot>In Annie's garden on a weekend she is supposed to go off for a secret tryst with her brother-in-law, Norman. Annie's gotten tired of waiting for dim veterinarian neighbor, Tom, to sweep her off her feet. Her brother Reg and wife Sarah arrive to care for Annie and Reg's mum, so Annie can leave. Norman shows up, hiding in the bushes, and before he can signal Annie, he's spotted and has to pretend he's come to visit. Tom pops round for food, and Norman's wife, the cool and tough Ruth, comes to visit mum. In the garden, Norman tries to spirit Annie away, Reg and Tom speculate on who Norman's got as his "bit on the side," and Ruth sunbathes. Will peace ever return to the garden?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579629</url></doc>
