<plot>Isolation and redemption in the urban ocean. "bubble" is a short film about isolation in urban life. In a parallel universe where people breath water, not air, peoples' heads are surrounded by clear bubbles that are filled with water - completely submerging the head. People live in a dry world, but with their heads constantly submerged. The two characters in "bubble" seem to be complete opposites. One a successful business man, the other homeless. As the businessman goes to and from work, he avoids the homeless man, who tries to make contact. He sees the homeless man is caring for a small bubblehead baby, filling the baby's bubblehead with water - even using water from his own bubble, lowering his level dangerously. When the homeless man goes missing, the businessman begins a search throughout the city - all the way to the world's edge. What he discovers there will change the course of all their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?085111</url></doc>
