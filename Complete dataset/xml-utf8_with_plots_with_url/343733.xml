<plot>It was not until Nicolae Ceausescu's dark curtain of secrecy fell that Romania was exposed as a country in a state of disaster. Perhaps the greatest atrocity has been the discovery of the homes for irrecoverable children, a national government system through which Romania's most disabled children are packed into decaying buildings where they receive inferior and sometimes brutal care. Lost and Found steps inside some of Romania's most deplorable institutions and illustrates the tremendous impact that inhumane living conditions have had on this population of children. The documentary also examines one institution which has begun to show signs of improvement, with aid from outside Romania.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343733</url></doc>
