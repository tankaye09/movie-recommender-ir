<plot>What significance does Martin Luther King Jr. hold for today's teenagers? Their parents were in elementary school when Dr. King was assassinated, so how do they interpret his legacy? In his breakthrough film, Colorblind, 16-year-old documentarian Andrew Blum explores the slain civil-rights leader's place in history. Poignant interviews with urban, suburban and rural high school students offer a compelling look at how teens cope with discrimination and intolerance. And experts-from Rep. Charles Rangel and historian Albert Vorspan to NYU Film School's Sheril Antonio and Holocaust survivor Martin Mermelstein-share their experiences growing up with prejudice, tracing how hate speech can escalate to genocide. Set against musical vignettes from Pulitzer Prize winner Blood on the Fields, a jazz opera about slavery by Wynton Marsalis, Colorblind offers a multigenerational, multicultural perspective on one of society's most pressing problems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111055</url></doc>
