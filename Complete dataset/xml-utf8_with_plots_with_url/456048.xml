<plot>Rats: The Great Underrated Pet tells the story of rats as pets; from their history as vermin to the present as beloved pets. It covers all aspects of rats: the history in movies, their part in the plague, Halloween, sewers, Hell and monsters, literary fame and how they became pets. There are many rat owners, including a rescue that saved over a hundred rats from a movie set and the Rat Fan Club, a rat club based out of Chico, CA with over 400 members across the world. Narrated by Emmy winner Scott Herriott, the documentary was approved by the Rat and Mouse Club of America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?456048</url></doc>
