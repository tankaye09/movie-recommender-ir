<plot>When eight-year-old Eliana's father is sent to Iraq, she learns it's not only soldiers who go to war. When a family member ships out to fight, the entire family is put in harm's way. Along with her pregnant mother, Eliana struggles with fear for her father as well as her fear of her family's disintegration. And against the backdrop of mounting casualties in Iraq, she searches for a way to protect them all. Her father has promised her the whole family would be reunited at their favorite restaurant. With a child's limited understanding but a warrior's heart, she sets out alone to find the restaurant and so bring her father home. In this adventure, she faces the ultimate test of her courage and her love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014585</url></doc>
