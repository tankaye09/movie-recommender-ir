<plot>Stashu Kybartas visits Lithuania in search of the village where his grandfather was born. Although the fall of the Soviet Union allows the filmmaker to cross borders and search for origins, not having the usual guideposts of connections and remembered clues from the family makes this a strange and alienating odyssey. After taking him months to access Lithuanian government records, it is wildly surprising that he finds his fatherâ€™s cousin, Kasyte Pukevicine, someone who is not only related by blood, but someone whose temperament and view of life strike a chord within his own inner-self.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?117139</url></doc>
