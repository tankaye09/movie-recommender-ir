<plot>This short film is another example of Jewish characterizations in the silent era. Moshe is sad about not winning the heavyweight championship and decides on a rematch. Introduced at the fight as weighting 98 pounds, Moshe is afraid when the "champ" is introduced at 240 pounds. When his "second" administers dope via a syringe, Moshe, who had been losing up to that point, defeats the champ and is the hero. Then, he wakes up and realizes it was all a dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248178</url></doc>
