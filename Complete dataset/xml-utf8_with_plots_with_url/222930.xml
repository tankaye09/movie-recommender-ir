<plot>Actress Greta May has lost her confidence. She has lost her rising-star boyfriend Oliver Morrell. And she has lost her big break in a major new play that Oliver has made a roaring success. When a stranger gives Greta his telephone number it only adds to her sense of desolation until her worldly flatmate Rachel tells her the only way to get over one man is to get under another. Greta May is uncertain about Rachel's shallow advice but, left alone, she makes the phone call in the vain hope that an encounter with the stranger will change her life and put her back in the spotlight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222930</url></doc>
