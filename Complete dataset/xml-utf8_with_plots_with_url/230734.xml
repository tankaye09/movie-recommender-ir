<plot>Tribal trickster Harold Sinseer and his Warriors of Orange make an unusual proposal to the white board members of the Bily Foundation. After having received a grant to grow miniature oranges at their Great Lakes region reservation, they now plan to get funds for growing pinch coffee beans and building coffee houses on the reservation. Their postcolonial, postindian scheme is sympathetically executed as they take the board members on a teasing teaching tour throughout the area that includes an urban tribal naming ceremony, session at the university anthropology museum and race-defying softball game. In the end, everybody has won something and a love affair of the past has failed to receive final closure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?230734</url></doc>
