<plot>Alfonso is 58 years old and lung emphysema is killing him. He is connected to an oxygen machine 24 hours a day. Ricardo, only 36 years old, has already developed lung cancer. Isabel is 72 years old and has had surgery for larynx cancer. Iris was born with severe growth problems. The documentary analyzes their lives; they are the faces of illnesses directly linked to tobacco smoking, that is the first cause of death in our country. 4 out of 10 Spanish men and women smoke and the illnesses linked to cigarettes cause the biggest expense of the health system. But the problem is not for smokers only, people who are condemned to live with smoke and that do not smoke themselves, passive smokers, are tobacco victims too. Every year 750 people die in Spain due to the tobacco they have never smoked. The documentary shows to which degree of smoke exposition is submitted in her work Angelita, a bar waitress, and how the lack of clear laws on smoking in working places has become a source of conflict. Doctors speak clearly: one out of two smokers are going to die of an illness directly or indirectly linked to tobacco smoking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113609</url></doc>
