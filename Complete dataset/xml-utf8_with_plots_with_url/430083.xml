<plot>By addressing for the first time the vast New York City audience, Italian star singer/composer Jovanotti tells a story of love and bound with the City he elected as his second home. Through his concerts held at the Highline Ballroom and Le Poison Rouge, as well as through his successful meet and greets at the Italian Cultural Institute and the Casa Italian in NYC, in music and words Jovanotti reflects upon life, the times we're living, his personal emotions, and unveils tales and images he could catch around the streets of New York.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430083</url></doc>
