<plot>A distracted Hollywood casting director and her disgruntled assistant attempt to cast quality films from the very bottom rung of the casting ladder. Along the way, they audition a series of wacky characters, all trying to make it big in Tinseltown. Julia Johnston has been a casting director in Hollywood for years, most of the time casting "B" movies and straight-to-DVD films. She and her assistant, Michael, try to maintain calm in an office that seems to thrive on chaos. This show follows their days in casting, intercut with interviews with Julia and Michael, who seem to be living in two totally different worlds. A typical day for this casting office could run anywhere from two bored people inventing fake casting projects to a chaotic day of seeing actors that aren't right for the roles they're reading for. Julia and Michael's take on the day's events are so dissimilar that we wonder if they're working in the same office.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096125</url></doc>
