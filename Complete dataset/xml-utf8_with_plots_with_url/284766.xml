<plot>Widower Ram Kapoor lives a very wealthy lifestyle in Bombay, but is very lonely, as his only child, a son named Rajesh, lives abroad, and his aged dad, Diwan Bahadur, lives in the village. Ram frequently throws lavish parties to overcome this loneliness. This changes when Rajesh returns home, and he is able to convince Diwan also to return so that the three could live together. Shortly thereafter differences crop up between Rajesh and Diwan - initially on love and marriage; then on Caste issues; then the marriage of Rajesh, which is arranged with Diwan's friend, Thakur Janak Singh's daughter, Rukmani, while Rajesh wants to marry Monica. Things come to such a pass that Ram decides to leave, takes to women and alcohol in a big way, and becomes the subject of a big scandal. Ram returns home after Diwan and Rajesh apologize and agree to live together in harmony. This harmony does not last long as soon Ram finds out that his very own father and son had conspired against him in a charade to get him to return home just to avoid further scandal. Watch what Ram does this time when bitterness and acrimony reinstates itself in the Kapoor household.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284766</url></doc>
