<plot>One of Philadelphia's proudest possessions is League Island, the United States government's Navy Yard, where her ships are held ready for action at all times. Numerous battleships, monitors, and cruisers can plainly be seen in the dry docks. Thousands of visitors to Philadelphia are met here daily inspecting the war vessels which took part in the Spanish-American war.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421932</url></doc>
