<plot>The year is 2012, and in an internment camp, a small camera is found that contains video of a former camp resident. The video clips are presented to chronicle one prisoner's experience in the internment camps during United States Martial Law. The RFID protests included citizens who refused the ID chip who for them, was their only act of protest. Once resisters were rounded up and sent to camps, there, they were to be chipped and sent home. It didn't always turn out that way. A prisoner in an internment camp has smuggled a small camera into the camp, and logs how her life is impacted by martial law, and being held against her will.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267028</url></doc>
