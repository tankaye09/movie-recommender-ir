<plot>A couple discover that they are 1950s television characters. When Jenny and Adolph realize that their entire house has "stopped" and that they are unable to open their door they break a window only to discover what is really outside. Curiosity leads them to travel to different television shows through their window, the first being a children's show that has become corrupt with adult influences. The next is a soap opera, which Adolph enters only to have his life threatened by a feuding man and woman. The strangely familiar characters outside their window leads them to the discovery of what they are and what has happened to them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?092595</url></doc>
