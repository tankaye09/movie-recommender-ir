<plot>"FRANCES-A Mother Divine" is a touching and humorous docu-dramedy about Frances Milstead, the mother of the late actor/drag queen, DIVINE. This film champions human rights by capturing a glimpse of the life of Frances and her courageous humanitarian spirit. It is an unconditional love story to her deceased son as this ordinary woman journeys into an extraordinary world and becomes a mother to an entire community. Frances took the unimaginable experience; losing her only child; and turns it into the most wonderful gift a mother could give. By embracing the gay community, and following the iconic path of her son, she has inherited the most befitting name "The Mother Divine". During filming, Frances, now 87, learned that she has lung cancer. While battling this terrible disease, Frances never gave up on her purpose and continues to spread her message of Love and Acceptance of all people wherever she goes. She believes that she has survived as long as she has because in her own words "My work on Earth isn't done yet."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202162</url></doc>
