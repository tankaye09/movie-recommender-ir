<plot>Shows the fire department of Greater New York going about its business. A great picture. Engine drawn by three horses, hook and ladder truck, horse cart and patrol wagon, all come dashing up the street at furious speed. Men and boys follow, running in the middle of the roadway. An excellent film in every respect, clear, distinct, and full of exciting action.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042228</url></doc>
