<plot>Stefcho is 82 years old. He lives in a miserable panel flat in a far-flung neighborhood. Like all Bulgarian pensioners, he lives on bread and yogurt. Every morning he methodically massages himself from head to toe. He tints his hair and his mustache with Aroma's shade No. 3. He sings in the funeral choir at the Central Sofia Cemetery. He plays the guitar. He performs virtuoso renditions of Italian canzonetti. He can do uncanny imitations of all sorts of animals. He never misses a new movie; as of now he has seen more than 32,000 different films. He collects posters, commemorative pins, razor blades, reproductions of works by great artists, illustrated cards, magazines, postage stamps, pictures of flowers and birds, calendars, and photos of movie stars and singers. His most prized possession, however, is his endless collection of love stories.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036951</url></doc>
