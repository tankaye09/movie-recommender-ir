<plot>This is a familiar scene to every Philadelphian. Woodside Park, a new pleasure ground adjacent to Fairmount, proved a paying investment to its promoters. It is a most beautiful part of the country, and well worth seeing. This reproduction is true in every sense, and is conceded to be the best of its kind ever produced. It is clear and brilliant, and sure to please everybody.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660535</url></doc>
