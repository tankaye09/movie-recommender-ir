<plot>Veer lives a middle-class lifestyle in a village in Southern India along with bis elder brother and Bhabi. Veer is a generous man who likes to help out everyone. He has an admirer in Malini, who hopes to marry him, and already has received approval from Veer's brother and Bhabi. Veer unexpectedly gets married to Malini's friend, Sita, who is blind, much to the displeasure of his brother, who refuses to bless this alliance, and even asks Veer to leave. Veer leaves, rents a room, earns a living, as well as does household chores, and looks after Sita. Things also change for Malini after she is forced to marry a man she does not love. Things get worse for Malini when her husband forbids her to meet with Sita and Veer, and get even more complicated when Veer decides to share their room with a physically handicapped youth who has a secret agenda of his own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284214</url></doc>
