<plot>This film is based on the short story "The Millenary Man" written by the director, recounting the anxieties and fears experienced one late summer afternoon of the year 2000 while contemplating the recurring images of homeless people. Fifteen actors (8 males and 7 females) are placed in front of the camera and asked to re-tell the story of the character of Gabriele as if it were their own. It is a reflection of an equally psychological state of 'homelessness' in the mind of an artist looking for a 'home.' It represents an attempt to voice one's inner dilemmas and understand one's surroundings; to dispense light on the occasional, or underlying, strangeness of one's feelings. The 16mm black and white film, the scratches and jagged look, the experimentation with sounds and music styles are all meant to mirror such a state and process. It is a film made of that which is left at the fringes of society-as if it were disowned by the community it belongs to-while attempting to re-appropriate one's identity in it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015777</url></doc>
