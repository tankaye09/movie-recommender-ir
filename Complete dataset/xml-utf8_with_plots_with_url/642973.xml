<plot>Voices of Ayacucho, Peru" is the compelling story of the Ayacuchan people's determination to survive during one of the most brutal terrorist wars of this century. Aesthetically beautiful and rich with emotion, "Voices of Ayacucho, Peru" is guaranteed to inform, entertain and unite the hearts of audiences as it provides a rare glance into the intimate life of Edwin Sulca, the people of Ayacucho, and the stories "woven" in and amongst these characters. The documentary also highlights one of Peru's most colourful festivals called Semana Santa or Holy Week, and incorporates stock footage showing the damage done in preceding years by the terrorist regime Sendero Luminoso.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?642973</url></doc>
