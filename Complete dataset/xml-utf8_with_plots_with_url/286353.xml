<plot>Two small children, Rekha and Amar, undergo a marriage ceremony under guidance of their respective parents. Years later, Rekha and Amar have grown up, and are now capable of fulfilling their marriage vows and living together. Both are attracted to each other. It is only after a few days of their living together that Amar confides to Rekha, that his real name is Kumar, and that the man she married in her childhood is his best friend, Amar, who is already married with Lata, and have a child of their own. Devastated, Rekha must now come to terms with her new life-partner, or seek drastic alternative remedies to escape the stigma that has been thrust upon her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?286353</url></doc>
