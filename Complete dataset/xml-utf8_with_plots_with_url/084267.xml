<plot>Long ago and far away there was a baseball team that played in Brooklyn, New York, known formally as the Brooklyn Dodgers but lovingly by their fans as "Dem Bums" (because they seldom won the pennant and the team-and-city motto was "Wait 'Till Next Year")and their most hated rivals was the cross-town New York Giants and, give or take a few bad calls by umpires, and outfielders who let fly balls drop everywhere but in a glove, and baserunners standing on the same bag, and players who threw behind the runner streaking for home... all was right in this world dominated by Ebbets Field. This "Pacemaker" from Paramount takes a look at the 1946 season of the Brooklyn Dodgers, managed by Leo "the Lip" Durocher, who married movie star Laraine Day, got suspended from baseball for a year by the Commissioner for being too palsy with the bookies at the race track and was the first to say "Nice Guys Finish Last." It also takes a look at the fans who believed that the only good umpire was a dead umpire, and an even closer look at most famous fan, Hilda Chester. Dodgers radio broadcaster Red Barber is also on hand. The Dodgers didn't win (again) in 1946 but wait 'till next year.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084267</url></doc>
