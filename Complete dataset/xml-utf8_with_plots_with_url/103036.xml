<plot>Justin (Blake Iriving) is on the edge, driven to half-hearted suicide attempts. Through as series of flashbacks to infancy we quickly discover why, as we learn of his overprotective mother, Justine (Gail Fenton), who showers him with affection from day one. It's a chicken and egg exploration of who's more neurotic - the suicidal son or the overbearing mother. With a deadpan comedic tone, stylish visuals, and stand-out performances from the entire cast, this deliciously dark comedy gives new meaning to the term "unresolved mother issues" as it raises the question: How much is too much love?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103036</url></doc>
