<plot>Gambaa is digging the earth to finance his living with the gold he finds. This way he depends a little less on nature and its mood. Mongolian gold diggers - so called Ninjas - move rather with the gold than with animals, and have become a growing autonomous minority in Mongolia. An 'essay-istic' photo-montage illustrates changes in Mongolian society. It reflects how traditional nomad culture is confronted with the modern, and quite revolting, culture of gold digging. Tracing the rebellious way of life of the so called "Ninjas" in modern Mongolia, which clings to the religious concept in between the sky and the earth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249711</url></doc>
