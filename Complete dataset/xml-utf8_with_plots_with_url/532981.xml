<plot>Tears of Benevolence is about a Chinese business woman, Yuting Wang, who recovers from a heart attack after discovering a meditation practice. It is a second chance in her life and she becomes determined to live as a better person. Soon after, the meditation practice is banned and thousands of practitioners have their homes ransacked and are taken to prison. In response, Wang goes to Beijing to appeal and is arrested. In prison, unspeakable violence and terror reign. Wang upholds her noble cause of justice and meets retaliation through torture. The prison guards attempt to brainwash her, but to no avail. Near death, Wang is released and she escapes to America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?532981</url></doc>
