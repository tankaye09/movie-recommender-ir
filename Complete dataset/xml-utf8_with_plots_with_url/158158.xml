<plot>A number of young ladies and gentlemen are at the swimming school, when they propose the game of "Follow the Leader," and such sights and scenes will hardly be repeated again in that swimming school. They slide down the toboggan, jump, play leap-frog, and do various other things they would little dream of doing had they known the motion picture-machine was in action. This picture is suitable for any class of audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158158</url></doc>
