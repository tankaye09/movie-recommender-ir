<plot>Screen titles introduce the film as an attempt to see sound. Reinald Werrenrath sings Wagner's "O Evening Song," as the artist creates moods through the eye. The abstract forms are generated by light playing on paper clips, jars, rings, and paper cut outs that are then rendered in multiple images. Shapes like stairways appear as the light exposes first the bottom then more; then the light gradually leaves. A statue of a woman appears. Shapes materialize then disappear. Reflection, refraction, dissolves, and superimposition combine with kaleidoscope effects. A lily appears as the song ends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?526141</url></doc>
