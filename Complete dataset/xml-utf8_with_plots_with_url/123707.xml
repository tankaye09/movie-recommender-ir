<plot>After the passing away of his widower and advocate dad, Vijay Srivastav takes it upon himself to raise his younger siblings, Vishal and Sudha. Years later, while Vishal is studying I.A.S., Sudha is of marriageable age, while Vijay makes a living driving an auto-rickshaw. He arranges Sudha's marriage with Anil, the only son of Ramprasad and Shanti, with a dowry of over 3 Lakh Rupees. The marriage takes place and Sudha re-locates to live with her in-laws. A few months later Vijay is informed that Sudha is expecting and brings her home. Shortly thereafter his world will be turned upside down when he finds out that Anil is getting married and had actually driven Sudha out as he suspected her of having an affair with another man. While Vijay attempts to deal with this situation, he does not know that Vishal has fallen in love with Jyoti, who is the daughter of Kalyan Singh - a man who is obsessed with avenging the death of his father at the hands of Vijay's dad, while Kalyan's son, Bheema, is all set to get married to Vijay's girlfriend, Chitra.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123707</url></doc>
