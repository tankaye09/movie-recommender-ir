<plot>A film adaptation of a great theatrical success of the actors Kostas Rigopoulos and Kakia Analyti, based on the comedy by Francois Campaux Chérie Noir. A writer is going through a serious crisis, since neither his career nor his marriage are going well. His talent, and friends, seem to have abandoned him. The only one standing by his side is a girl from Africa, who has come to Greece to study, and, in order to make ends meet, she works as a maid in his home. Naïve and kind, she manages to change the climate that reigns and restore a happy atmosphere to the home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025629</url></doc>
