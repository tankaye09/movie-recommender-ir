<plot>A young woman has a tragic accident, slipping on a skateboard and falling off the roof of a tall building. Koo Chi Ming, an insurance investigator, is sent to determine whether the girl's death is an accident or a suicide and he recognizes the young woman from an earlier chance encounter. His boss wants him to conclude it was a suicide so that the insurance company doesn't have to pay. The young woman's ghost visits Koo to tell him that her death was accidental and they fall in love. When Koo's girlfriend and his parents find out he's in love with a spirit, they hire an exorcist to get rid of her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663745</url></doc>
