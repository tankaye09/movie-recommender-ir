<plot>Tale of a young woman haunted by centuries old visions of Plymouth, Massachusetts from 1631. Cassandra attends the wake of her great grandmother, Zelda, while visiting her hometown. There was always something "witchy" about Zelda and the two were very close. Cassandra finds a mysterious trunk upstairs in the loft of her girlhood home left to her by her great grandmother. Unlocking the chest opens a doorway to 1631 Plymouth and sends her on a strange journey of self-discovery. Cassandra, fiercely independent and strong-willed, must find answers. Before leaving her hometown, and with the help of her two girlhood friends, Lori, a partying free-spirit, and Ashley, serious and reserved, Cassandra struggles to understand the ghosts invading her world. The three friends are witches on a quest, and a moonlit ritual offers an alarming burst of visions. On the drive home to Seattle, her boyfriend, Michael, wonders if Cassandra is losing it. Michael is a practical sort and tells Cassandra she's just tired and under a lot of stress. However, he tries to help her find reconciliation with the alleged apparitions, without really believing her. He'd much rather she shut up and be married to him... At night, Cassandra bolts upright from bed only to see a strange woman in a green robe moving through a dark forest. Dreams and waking mesh... A large, gray haired man leading a circle of witches in the forests of Plymouth enters her waking consciousness. Cassandra fights to keep her hold on reality as two realms collide. What she finds at the end of the road will completely transform her world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370588</url></doc>
