<plot>Brad and Kath stop riding their bikes to eat, and Kath starts choking, turning dark blue. He saves her with a simple technique known as the Heimlich Maneuver. The inventor of the procedure goes through several dramatized examples, based on actual cases. Frank Ramirez is saved by his best friend at a barbecue. Jeff saves smurf-blue Mrs. Price using a variation for children with the victim lying down. Dr. Heimlich shows a child named Cindy demonstrating on a doll called Jennifer, and Wendy saves her sister's 2 year-old Jamie when he chokes on a small toy after trying to jump on a cat. He also shows a young woman who knows how to do the procedure for herself when alone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564097</url></doc>
