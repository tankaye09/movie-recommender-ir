<plot>The film tells the story of a journey to live and work with Aborigines in the Australian outback. Leading Australian artist Peter Hupfauf and his son Fabian leave city life behind to face the struggle for survival in the desert. There the white painter from the city meets those who prefer to stay away from a civilization that destroyed their way of life. This film documents the use of art for the exploration of a different culture, it portrays a beautiful friendship, and leads back to our origins: when art and life were undivided.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470694</url></doc>
