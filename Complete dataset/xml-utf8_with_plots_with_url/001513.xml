<plot>James, Sophie and Wes - the twenty-something love triangle from hell - are on their way to a musical festival deep in the Australian bush when some car trouble leaves them stranded. The trio is picked up by Reg Morgan, a local boy who runs a struggling fertilizer business with his wound up older brother, Lindsay. He'll take the kids to the festival, but will need to make a stop by the plant to pick up some more stock. Over the course of one terrifying afternoon five characters will learn that relationships can be hard work, especially when somebody's trying to turn you into fertilizer.</plot><plot>James, Sophie and Wes - the twenty-something love triangle from hell - are on their way to a musical festival deep in the Australian bush when some car trouble leaves them stranded.
