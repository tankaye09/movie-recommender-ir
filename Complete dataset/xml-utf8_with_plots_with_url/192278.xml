<plot>A female contortionist is here shown, turning handsprings and with her trained dog going through numerous evolutions. The dog runs over her body while she turns handsprings. The picture ends showing the dog balancing itself from her feet as they are spread, while the girl balances herself on her shoulders, feet upward. A remarkable act and an excellent piece of photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192278</url></doc>
