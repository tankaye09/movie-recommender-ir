<plot>The usual number of bathers is seen enjoying themselves on the beach when two boys on a tandem attempt to ride through the surf. One is dressed in street costume, while the other is attired in a bathing suit. It occurs that they strike a hole in the beach and both are thrown into the water, much to the amusement of the spectators.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206752</url></doc>
