<plot>Written by newcomer Lamont Carswell (Damaged), the series follows the experiences of two brothers Darius and Dallas. Darius and his family live in a small town in Florida where he divides his time with his small auto detailing company, his girlfriend, Tori, and his slew of friends. After his father's sudden death from prostate cancer, Darius gets a life-altering surprise before his father's funeral: He has a half-brother named Dallas, that is the same age as he is. It seems that before his death, Darius' father wrote to Dallas, his illegitimate son and informed him of his sickness. Confused and worried, Dallas shows up in Florida to find that his father has already passed away. He must now cope with his feelings for a father he never really knew and a brother he's not sure he even wants. For the bitter Darius, the feeling is mutual. "My Brother's Keeper" examines the intertwining of relationships between a diverse group of friends, lovers and ultimately, brothers. With a main cast of fifteen diverse characters, issues such as familial relations, sexual health, poverty, sexism, racism, classicism, domestic violence, sexuality and much more will be explored.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383473</url></doc>
