<plot>On one of the most important nights in history, John, a nationally recognized stage player, contemplates his life, the direction it has taken, and the experiences that have led him to the crossroads he now stands at. After a great deal of thought, the thespian arrives at the conclusion that the only way to fulfill his self proclaimed destiny of leaving his mark on his country is to stop portraying the heroes he has always admired and take it upon himself to change an entire nation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606808</url></doc>
