<plot>The story of Joshua and Sara begins years ago. Joshua was the quiet younger brother. And he all he could do was watch in torment as his inspiration, his love, Sara, was seriously involved with his brother Paul. Paul as charismatic as he was reckless. But soon Paul's impulsive behavior turns dark. He and Sara fall into an endless abyss of drugs. One night, Joshua breaks into their apartment to find Paul and Sara at the end of the line in a bottomless drug haze. Joshua tries to rescue Sara, but Paul in a fit of rage attacks his own brother. He almost kills Joshua. Joshua relocates and starts his life over again. He learns how to cook. And with pure determination he quickly rises up threw the ranks and becomes an accomplished chef. But becomes a work-a-holic with no social life. His quiet demeanor has turned acidic. And he can never shake the memories of Sara and Paul. One day, after work, Paul walks outside and standing in the middle of the parking lot is Sara.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?477532</url></doc>
