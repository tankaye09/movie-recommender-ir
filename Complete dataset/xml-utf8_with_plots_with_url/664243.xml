<plot>Until 9/11, Yasin Zaki, 10, lived an ordinary life with his Jordanian-born parents in Southern California. After the attack, Yasin's life is turned upside down when the FBI arrests his father in a terrifying early morning raid. Still suffering from the trauma of his father's detention, Yasin's misfortunes are compounded at school, where he is the target of malicious and fearful accusations. Lashing out at his classmates, Yasin is increasingly unable to cope. Finally, Yasin and his mother visit his father in jail. Half-believing the accusations of "terrorist," Yasin must decide whether or not to believe in his father and accept his love in the face of unanswerable questions. In the process, Yasin must gain the courage to confront the realities of life as a Muslim Arab-American in post-9/11 America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664243</url></doc>
