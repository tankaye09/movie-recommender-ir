<plot>A young, reclusive photographer named Claudio discovers a compelling bond with the enigmatic Lena, who has just returned home for a short hiatus from big city life. As they spend more time together, his openness with Lena grows, just as their relationship grows beyond the definable boundaries of ordinary, platonic friendship. When Lena announces her plans for a return to normal life, Claudio struggles to put aside his fears about the future. Unsettled by the changes that lie ahead, as well as the parallels that begin to emerge between his current circumstances and events of the past, Claudio seeks to reach some form of understanding with Lena before she leaves, unable to witness the disintegration of a profound connection by things left unsaid.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118220</url></doc>
