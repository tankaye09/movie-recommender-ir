<plot>Peg Entwistle, the only person to have committed suicide from the Hollywood Sign, was an accomplished stage actress who has been misrepresented as a failed starlet since her death in 1932. This short film, made in conjunction with the documentary "Under the Hollywood Sign" (2009), attempts to restore the truth of her story by presenting a straightforward account of her final hour, when she walked three miles from her home in Beachwood Canyon to the lighted Sign that served as a billboard for the Hollywoodland housing tract. Dignified even in her despair, Peg walks up Beachwood Drive through the stone gates of Hollywoodland, pausing to read the suicide note she carries in her handbag. She passes storybook houses as she climbs, darkened streets giving way to dirt paths as she nears the Sign. Finally, at the base of the letter "H," she takes off her coat, throws down her handbag and prepares to climb the ladder that will facilitate her death. She was 24 years old when she jumped; her suicide was the catalyst in the Sign's transformation from real estate billboard to icon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427601</url></doc>
