<plot>After living in Malawi, Trinidad, and India, Tania Trepanier, the filmmaker, has learned to use dance as a way to claim culture and create a sense of home. In this documentary, Tania searches for community through dance in Los Angeles and meets three talented dancers. This film explores the lives and stories of these dancers # Shivani, Hector, and Bradley- through the eyes of Tania. In her late teens Tania returned to Canada from her travels to Asia and Africa. Seen only for her white skin and blonde hair, her childhood experiences were invisible to her peers. Denied a part of her identity, Tania sought a way to express her hybridity. She envisioned creating a dance fusion piece for film that explores different cultural dance forms. She meets Michelle Zeitlin, an established choreographer, and Mo Jen, an experienced LA composer, and together with a group of professional dancers, they set about the task of creating a dance piece.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125368</url></doc>
