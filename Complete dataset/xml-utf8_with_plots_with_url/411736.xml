<plot>Antonio is a seductive, charismatic Sicilian living illegally in New York. He wanders from job to job, lives as a squatter and enjoys a carefree romantic tryst with a wealthy art dealer. When he falls in love with Ellen, a strong-willed radio talk-show host who is set to move to Paris within a few days, he decides he must find a way to keep her from leaving. Meanwhile, Antonio's friend Apu faces a love challenge of his own. Apu is a young Indian-turned-New Yorker who was sent from his homeland with his family's life savings to find the American dream of success and fulfillment. He works hard at odds jobs-- from being a guinea pig in a drug-testing lab to dubbing porno films. Then his life is completely uprooted on the day his pre-arranged wife from India arrives in New York--the woman chosen by their families when they were children, one he hasn't seen since he was 8 and she was 4. Apu is caught between the old world and the new--trying to find love and happiness within the confines of his pre-determined destiny. The film is about what happens when cultures clash--about expectations and reality, dreams of love and money, and life when the timing is way off.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?411736</url></doc>
