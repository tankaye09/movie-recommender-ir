<plot>The nineteen twenties, a woman prepares to go out with a man. She has a straight razor which won't be used to give the man a shave but to kill him. She has done this many times, for pleasure and for money. But tonight, as she prepares before her mirror, she has doubts, fears, and questions. Tonight guilt knocks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?224473</url></doc>
