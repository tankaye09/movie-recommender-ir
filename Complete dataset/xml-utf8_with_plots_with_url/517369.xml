<plot>A psychoanalyst discusses a new phenomenon in urban America: women driven mad by loneliness. He gives us four case studies, women he has treated. Elaine, 24, a secretary, and Janis, 24, a teacher, separately find a brochure about vacations in Miami Beach. What looks like a wild time of partying and dissolution becomes even more bizarre. Ann seems well-adjusted but complains of nonexistent rashes that lead to her showing lots of skin to strangers. The doctor fears for her arrest, so he comes up with an ingenious solution. Sally is his strangest patient: she wants such perfection in a man that she ends up with a Fiberglas mannequin. She requires the doctor's most personal cure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?517369</url></doc>
