<plot>Federico lives near Rome, Matteo is from northern Italy. On first impression Federico is a sulky child, not very communicative. Matteo, on the other hand, is a restless child, who always seeks attention. They are both eight, and they have another element in common: they are blind. This film follows them in their daily lives, as they interact with their families, their friends, at school and on holiday. It's the story of two ordinary kids, their fears, their hopes, and their ordeals. Then, one day, the phone rings, and they meet: they are to take part in a film. It's the beginning of a new friendship.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033071</url></doc>
