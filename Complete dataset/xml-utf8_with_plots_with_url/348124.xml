<plot>A unique documentary that chronicles the amazing career of turn-of-the-century moving picture pioneer Lyman H. Howe of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, whose six touring companies introduced most of rural American to the movies. Special archival footage includes the first successful moving pictures ever taken from an airplane (Lincoln Beachey, Wilkes-Barre, 1911); the historic address delivered by President Theodore Roosevelt to 100,000 (Wilkes-Barre, 1905); Construction of the Panama Canal (1913),and Lyman H. Howe Days at the San Diego and San Francisco World's Fairs (California 1915). Long before talking pictures, Lyman H. Howe entertainments featured the photograph and live sound effects from behind the screen. Included are voiceovers by individuals who were part of the Lyman Howe moving picture shows and who remember, first hand, the impact they made a century ago.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?348124</url></doc>
