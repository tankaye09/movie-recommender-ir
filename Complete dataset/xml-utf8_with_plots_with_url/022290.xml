<plot>Arjun (Govinda) lives a charmed life, surrounded by the family he loves and working at his family's thriving business. Then he meets Pooja (Manisha Koirala), and his life gets even better. The two quickly fall in love. But when a mysterious attempt to kill the happy couple alerts them to the presence of danger, their troubles are only beginning, and soon Arjun's brother (Rahul Roy) is killed in an accident no one could have foreseen. Pooja is mistakenly convicted of murder, and Arjun must save her while he keeps up his family responsibilities, but his father soon meets a cruel end as well. Now, on the run from both the police and the mysterious criminals, Arjun and Pooja work to expose the truth while evading a fate at the hands of either.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022290</url></doc>
