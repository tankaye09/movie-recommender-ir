<plot>Five Scottish lads, ages 10 to 13, get ready for a public performance with their heavy metal band, "Hatred." They rehearse, fire their bass player, audition for a new one, make a CD at a recording studio, and appear at a family fun day. One of the dads is their manager; we hear from him and one of the moms at whose house they rehearse. The lads talk about their playing, singing, and song writing. The gig is a success and all the CDs sell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233817</url></doc>
