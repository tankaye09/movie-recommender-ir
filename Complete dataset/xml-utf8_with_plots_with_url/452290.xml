<plot>Should serially-offending addicts be locked up or can people be given the chance to change? With a significant increase in funding over the next three years, the government believes rehabilitation is the future. Phoenix House treatment centres offer addicts the chance to change their lives through a six-month residential programme. Some arrive voluntarily, destitute and at the end of their tether; others have been sent by the courts and face lengthy prison sentences should they fail the programme. With unique and intimate access to the therapeutic process, this moving, observational film follows a number of residents on an intensely personal journey that could literally save their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452290</url></doc>
