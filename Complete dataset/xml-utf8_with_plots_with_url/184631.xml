<plot>Fourth of July weekend, 1959 Farren "Rennie" Ledge will go home for the first time in 3 years. To the outsider nothing seems to change much in the small town of Klarmont. However, to a native coming back after a long absence, the subtle differences are shocking. Rennie, a PHD candidate and Fulbright Scholar, must relearn a few life lessons in her birthplace to ensure she keeps herself on track. These lessons will include: coming to terms with her future, finding her poetic voice and reaching a separate peace with her past. Along the way she is helped by her best gal pal and local beautician, Leala Sanders. Her other childhood friends and foes also play large roles in this dramedy. In the end Rennie learns that she must be sure of herself, before she can make her way in the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184631</url></doc>
