<plot>Billy is a boy with a problem - he bites people. Without discrimination or any particular reserve, he targets classmates, teachers, parents, and just about anyone else that crosses him at the wrong moment. Painful as it would be to be on the wrong end of his wrath - it's his poor Mother, Lily who feels the greatest burden in trying to understand her sons behavior. It's on the morning of a particularly nasty biting bout that Lily is forced to take the reins on curing her son's psychological set back - as Billy is banished from school until he can clean up his act. Being committed to the cause, Lily sets out with her son, visiting Doctors of every avenue. As the inevitable continues to unfurl in predictable fashion, and Billy continues to bite to his hearts desire, Lily questions if there's any hope in the matter. When Billy finally turns his teeth to Lily, he finds himself at the end of his rope. With his mother losing faith in his reform, his school unwilling to accept him back and every doctor in town scared at the thought of seeing him, Billy finds himself at a crossroad. With the deck stacked against him - it will ultimately be in Billy's hands to decide if change is possible.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070828</url></doc>
