<plot>Trent Camden hasn't had a full night's sleep in three months. Every time his body is on the verge of reaching deep sleep, his breathing stops, and he must be awakened by a machine before lack of oxygen kills him where he lies. As days pass by, Trent is alarmed by the increasingly frequent occurrences of missing time, moments when his fatigued body slips into states of semi-consciousness. But there's more to his condition than he realizes: the more sleep deprived Trent becomes, the more he begins to experience hallucinations, lucid dreams. In the wake of personal tragedy, the possibility of indulging in these visions offers more than Trent can resist, even at the cost of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?399601</url></doc>
