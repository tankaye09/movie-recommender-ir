<plot>SEVEN MILES ALONE is a short film about two brothers in search of themselves within the confines of a small fishing town and the borders of the boxing ring. PARIS and ROME are two adopted brothers growing up side by side like shadows of one another. They are both promising boxers, but when ROME gets the opportunity of a lifetime to begin his career as a professional boxer, he takes it, leaving his mother and brother behind. Time passes, mom suffers from a stroke, Paris stays home to care for her, and Rome's career turns for the worst. The only way to revitalize Rome's career is to hype up a fight between the two brothers. The two meet in the ring, where one fights for forgiveness while the other fights for revenge. SEVEN MILES ALONE is a drama about two brothers; about the conflict we all face between the commitment to our dreams and our sense of obligation to others, and in particular, to our family.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?487555</url></doc>
