<plot>After having been one of the most successful film directors in Europe in the nineteen sixties, Vojtech Jasny -Czech, 81-, lives now forgotten by many in a small apartment in New York. His life and filmmaking are inseparable and in LIFE AND FILM Vojtech himself, from his home in New York and through the visits to his old friends, will recount his own story, from the Nazi invasion in Czechoslovakia to the Soviet invasion, subsequent exile and his arrival to New York years later. In filmmaking he lived success and got to live and work with the most internationally important filmmakers, musicians and writers of the time. Even if his constant social and political compromise obligued him to exile and made him suffer three KGB attacks against his life, Vojtech always kept faithful to his believes, even if that took him to oblivion. "I never went for money, I always went for friends and for what I think is fair and truthful," says Vojtech, who still, at his age, keeps making films: "film is my message and I will do it until I die, when my job is done my time to go will arrive."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?335672</url></doc>
