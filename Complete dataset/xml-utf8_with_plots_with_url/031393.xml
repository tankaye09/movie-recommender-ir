<plot>A detective is investigating on Andres Carrera, speech-writer of a politician man. Andres disappeared during the electoral campaign. The detective slowly 'penetrates' in Andres' life: he begins to live at Andres' home; to work at Andres' office; to meet Andres' parents; to seek a sort of relation with Andres' wife and colleagues. The election campaign is going on, but nobody can write so 'poetic' and so 'politic' speeches as Andres did. What is the secret of his speeches? Why his nickname was "Whitman", like American poet? Why Andres disappeared and where he is now? And why the detective is so interested in it, beyond his professional task? Maybe being in relation with Andres parents and wife will reveal every solution to the detective. Or it will include everything in a dream...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031393</url></doc>
