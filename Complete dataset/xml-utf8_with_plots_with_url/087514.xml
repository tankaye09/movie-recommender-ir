<plot>Can you learn maths from riding horses? You can at Bush School! Ex-army colonel Colin Baker and his wife Sandra, who run an outback school, share a dream with local Aboriginal elder Colin Freddie to bring practical education to the children of a remote Australian community. Bush School is a heart-warming story of overwhelming success despite the odds. It follows Colin, Sandra the kids and their community over two and half years as they deal with the challenges of remote education. In the face of immense odds, Bush School shows how a small community can come together to achieve a common goal that at one time seemed impossible - the dream of a decent education.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087514</url></doc>
