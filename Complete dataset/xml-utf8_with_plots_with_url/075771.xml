<plot>Twenty one year old David Ides, a senior at West Virginia University with dreams of an advertising career in the Big Apple, hasn't seen his grandmother since he was a kid. As a favor to his father, he reluctantly agrees to drive a couple of hundred miles to rural WV, just prior to Christmas vacation, to help move her into an assisted living home. Accompanied by his girlfriend, Connie Roy, who's just been accepted into the graduate psychology program at New York University, they make the long trip to Grandma's large, isolated house. Upon arrival they discover that Dave's father has mysteriously disappeared, and that Grandma, who seems 'so charming' at first - the perfect grandmother - is hiding a deadly secret that fractured her personality a long time ago. As the kids try and find out what happened to Dave's dad, both the house, which boarded many a rough-and-tumble coal miner in its day, and Grandma, start giving up their secrets one by one, leaving David and Connie to fear for their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075771</url></doc>
