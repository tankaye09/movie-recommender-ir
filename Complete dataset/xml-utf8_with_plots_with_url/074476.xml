<plot>In an attempt to find meaning in the two-party system, a first-time filmmaker travels to the all important state of Ohio for the 2004 Presidential election. What he finds is a state under siege from not only the two major parties, but also from itself. From the crush leading up to election day, to the largely ignored Green Party recount, Bleeding Ohio examines a twisted electoral system that insures its own survival at the expense of its citizens.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074476</url></doc>
