A well known drug addict tests the powder and Mick's dreams are crushed when it is discovered that the powder is Plaster of Paris. An East European man stumbles across the test and offers to buy the whole bag of 'cocaine'. Mick sets up an exchange and the deal is done for Â£10,000. Soon after the East European's car is hijacked and the bag of powder is snatched by a hooded gang who we discover are the pub regulars.
