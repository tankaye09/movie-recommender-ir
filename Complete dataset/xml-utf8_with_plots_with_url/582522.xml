<plot>An amateur photographer sets his camera up on a railroad track to make a photograph of an overhead bridge, and is so busily engaged focussing the bridge that he fails to notice an approaching express train which strikes him and throws him about ninety feet, completely demolishing his camera and tripod. As it is impossible to kill a kodak fiend, he jumps up, brushes himself off, picks up some pieces of the tripod, throws them down in disgust, shakes his fist at the fast receding train, steps directly in front of a train going in the opposite direction, and is recued by two men who push him off the track in time to save his life. An excellent subject, and warranted to please the most critical.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?582522</url></doc>
