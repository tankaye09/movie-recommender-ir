<plot>After a period of thirty years, bodies of young girls begin to show up in alleys around the city, all murdered in the same manner and all identical to a series of murders that took place thirty years ago. Detectives are faced not only with the problem of solving these horrific crimes, but a more daunting task is trying to determine whether a serial killer has surfaced again after thirty years or whether this is a copycat killing. The big question is, how could a copycat killer know every little detail of the crimes, especially when these details were never released to the public?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291557</url></doc>
