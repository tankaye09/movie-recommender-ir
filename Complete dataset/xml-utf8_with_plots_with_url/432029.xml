<plot>The first of the RKO Picture People series, filmed and released three months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, this entry is devoted to showing Hollywood's contribution to national defense, and begins with an aluminum party hosted by Sigrid Gurie with James and Lucile Gleason, Rochelle Hudson and Arline Judge in attendance. From there, it checks in on Reginald Denny and his model plane factory; G.P. Huntley's activities as a ham radio operator; Margaret Lindsay and Marian Marsh working at the Red Cross; James Craig and Anne Shirley with their aluminum donations; child actress Joan Carroll buying defense stamps; and winds up with a demonstration of Victor McLaglen's horse cavalry and motor corps unit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432029</url></doc>
