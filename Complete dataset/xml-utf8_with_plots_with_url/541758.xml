<plot>Boys in a town in Mozambique are playing football when a mean-spirited adult confiscates their ball. Two lads run to a convenience store and buy three condoms. They inflate them inside each other, wrap newspaper and twine around the makeshift ball, and then use yarn from a girl's dress that they unravel to make the ball the right size. The game starts again, and things go well until the ball sails over a fence into the lap of an elderly lady who's prepared for just such an event.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?541758</url></doc>
