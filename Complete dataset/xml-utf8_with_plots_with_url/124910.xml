<plot>Dalton's not the type of guy you're likely to remember. Quiet and unobtrusive, he's invisible to everyone at work and run over by his mother and sister at home. But all that changes when a street kid living behind Dalton's dumpster gives Dalton a mysterious pouch. Now, Dalton walks with a new confidence and strange peace. The alluring contents of his pouch bring him more attention than he's ever had - or possibly wanted. Dalton is alternately sought after and reviled by all who surround him, and he's starting to feel uncomfortable about it. When his secret ultimately leads to disaster, he breaks. With his prize turning out to be nothing but a curse, Dalton frantically searches for the kid who gave it to him. But the one person who can lift his burden has disappeared. Broken and alone, Dalton is left to choose for himself: Is his strange reward worth the price he has to pay?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?124910</url></doc>
