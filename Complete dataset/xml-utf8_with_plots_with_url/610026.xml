<plot>The 1969 version of "To Tell the Truth" was among the best known of all versions of this durable format. Many game show fans fondly remember this version for the colorful, "groovy" set (used from 1969-1973, after which a conservative, blue-accented set was used) and its soft rock-flavored lyrical theme. The format, however, remained the same as always: A team of three contestants, one the actual person associated with a story and two imposters, tried to fool the four-member celebrity panel. An affidavit relating a person's story is read sometimes funny; sometimes serious; sometimes inspirational; sometimes having to do with their profession, political activity or cause they were actively involved in; but always interesting. The celebrity panelists, one at a time, question the three contestants (addressing them by No. 1, No. 2. and No. 3) in an attempt to expose the liars and determine who was telling the truth. After all four celebrities have had their turn to question the team, they voted separately as to who they thought was the real person associated with the story. Payoffs were based on the team's ability to fool the panel $50 per incorrect vote and $500 for four incorrect votes. Often, the contestants were invited to demonstrate their skill; other times, skits and film vignettes were used to illustrate the person's story. Two such games were played per show.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?610026</url></doc>
