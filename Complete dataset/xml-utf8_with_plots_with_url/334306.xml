<plot>Mattia, a 32 year old building contractor in Perugia has lots of style, nice suits, nice car, gorgeous looking girlfriend but behind this facade is cutting corners with site safety and hiring immigrant workers. Taking to the golf course hoping to meet wealthy, upmarket clients he meets a doctor who offers him a contract to build a luxurious weekend getaway but not one Euro above 300,000 will he pay. Meantime back on site to save 12,000 euros in scaffolding he has illegally-hired worker Kamal working on a roof without any safety nets and Kamal falls from the roof, finishing up in hospital with his entire upper body in plaster. Kamal unknown to Mattia has won a position in a chocolate making competition at a nearby factory who are celebrating their centenary of operation. Before leaving Egypt, Kamal was a pastry cook in Egypt. By doing the chocolate course he hopes to gain a diploma to start a new career in Italy as a chocolate maker. First prize is enough money to start his own business. So Mattia has a choic;face the police or stand in for Kamal at the advanced chocolate making course. Egyptian laborer versus trendy Italian businessman. So goodbye pony tail, hello perm, goodbye smart phone and clothes. In the class are: a middle aged woman, a man whose father owns 4 pastry shops and the beautiful, passionate Cecilia, whose love life is littered with liars. Feeling sorry for our stand in Kamal she offers to coach Mattia, after hours, to improve his chocolate making. Mattia leads a double life of Egyptian by day, homework and contractor by day and night transforming in the process from being self centred to finding love and life at the same time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?334306</url></doc>
