<plot>Five sexual assaulters talk, for the first time, about their lives and their experience in the rehabilitation program they voluntarily attend in jail. Imprisoning rapists without treating them at all leads to no results. Sooner or later, more than 20% will assault again. The only hope lies in a rehabilitation program such as the one that is now being followed in some of Spain's prisons. The core questions are: is the treatment really effective to bring them back to society? And do sexual criminals deserve any opportunities after causing so much pain?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?311716</url></doc>
