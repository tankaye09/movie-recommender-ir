<plot>Mr. Carvajal, an old man who fled Mexico during the Revolution (of the 1910s), and his two young daughters, return to their native country after years living in Europe. When he left the country, his family belonged to the Higher Classes and owned huge amounts of land and properties, which were left in the care of faithful employees...but things have changed in Mexico. Upon their arrival in Mexico City, they are greeted by Arturo and his brother, whose family was close to the Carvajals'. Arturo, who used to be an active sportsman before the accident that left him an invalid, is also an immensely rich businessman and falls for Mr. Carvajal's younger daughter, the lovely Isabel; in turn his brother falls for Isabel's older sister, María Teresa. But Isabel is already in love with no-good playboy Federico de la Cadena, who is only interested in the Carvajals' fortune.....but then, there are some devastating news about the Carvajals' Estate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?053501</url></doc>
