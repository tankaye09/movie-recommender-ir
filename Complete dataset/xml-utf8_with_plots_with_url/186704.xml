<plot>Armin Lehmann provides an unscripted narration in Gary Lester's EYEWITNESS TO HISTORY, offering a fascinating insight into Hitler's Third Reich. Armin's early childhood days were spent on a bucolic estate in the forest, surrounded by pet animals. By 10 years old, Armin walked 45 minutes to school each day. He also joined the Hitler Youth. Life in the country began to lose its innocence. By age 16, Armin found himself a combat veteran, awarded the Iron Cross. By a quirk of fate, Armin is chosen to represent the Hitler Youth at Hitler's last birthday reception. Trapped in the bunker area with Hitler during the final days of the war, Armin delivers a riveting account of the collapse of the Third Reich from a unique historical perspective.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?186704</url></doc>
