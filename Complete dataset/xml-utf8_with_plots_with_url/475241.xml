<plot>Sam is a geeky sort of kid about eight years old who deeply misses his father. In Sam's fragile mind he has disappeared off the face of the planet, abducted by aliens. In an effort to bring him back home, Sam builds a gadget that transmits messages into space asking for his father. He watches and waits but nothing seems to happen. Eventually evil aliens intercept this message and travel to Earth, announcing an invasion that will bring about the end of mankind. Sam tries to avert the attack while his mother attempts to bury the evidence, but they are too late. An alien is beamed down into the backyard where Sam and his mother come face to face with an alien invader.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475241</url></doc>
