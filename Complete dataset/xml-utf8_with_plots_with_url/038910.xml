<plot>Archeological evidence from pre-Columbian America is compared with artifacts from the Mediterranean region. Visits are made to many historic sites in Mexico, Central &amp; South America. Musical "pan" pipes are shown that are very similar from both areas. Fabric that is thousands of years old found in Peru is woven from fibers that come from a hybrid of new and old world cotton. A stone box found in Iran seems similar to the box described by Joseph Smith as holding golden plates (The Book of Mormon, found within a hillside in New York). Mayan paintings showing both light and dark people are compared to Book of Mormon writings describing two distinct peoples. A possible baptismal font is found in the ruins of ancient Peru. The explorer Cortez used to his advantage being mistaken for the white and bearded god Quetzalcoatl, who according to the Aztec people had promised to return one day, similar to the teachings of Christ.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?038910</url></doc>
