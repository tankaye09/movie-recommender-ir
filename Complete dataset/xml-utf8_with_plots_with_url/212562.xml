<plot>George has been plodding miserably though life and his parents aren't making things any easier. His mother and father are a little...off...and caring for them has become a losing battle. When George turns to MediCorp-the family's health insurance company-for help, his awful life becomes pure agony. Less than successful in his efforts to garner support from the compassion-less corporation, George becomes desperate. In a final, foolhardy gambit, he faces off with MediCorp's eccentric CEO. But when he finally makes his stand, George discovers that he is a mere plaything in the corporate giant's surreal endgame.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?212562</url></doc>
