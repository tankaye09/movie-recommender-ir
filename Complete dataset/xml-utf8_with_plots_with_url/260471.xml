<plot>13 Skippers from Stuttgart, Germany start with their Crews for a 'round Atlantic Ocean' Trip. They originate from a small sailing Club situated on a little Pond surrounded by vineyards. Now they set out to the wide Ocean. From the African influenced Capverde Islands to the soothing Carribean, along the US Coast via Metropolitan New York to remote Newfoundland and then back to the Azores Islands. All in one Ship, a sailing Yacht called 'Odysseus'(Ulysses). 48 feet long, 24 feet tall and 19 tons in weight. They have to adjust to the Weather and Winds everyday. We are on board. We experience life on the Sail Boat hands on. We feel what it means to be sailing: eating and sleeping on the edge, living with the Crew on limited Space, keeping an eye on te waves day and night and always changing plans according to the winds. This voyage's success is set by the wind and the experience of the sailors only. 13 Skippers in one Boat are determined to sail round the Atlantic Ocean. It is an extraordinary team effort. You will discover the fascination of Sailing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260471</url></doc>
