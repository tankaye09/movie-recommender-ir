<plot>In "Breaking In Unlocked Doors" Aria, a young and troubled woman, a survivor of child abuse, reflects upon her most powerful childhood memories. She speaks passionately and painfully of her abusive father, her free spirited sister, and her silent teenage self. Told with both heartbreaking sincerity and heartwarming courage, Aria's story paints a vivid picture of her sister Kylie's repeated attempts to draw her into a brighter, happier world. Can Aria overcome the constant fear that keeps her locked in her own troubled thoughts? Can the love these two sisters share for each other help them escape their father's abuse? Can their innocence survive? We can only hope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082359</url></doc>
