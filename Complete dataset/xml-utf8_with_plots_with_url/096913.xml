<plot>A fine picture secured at the Depford Cattle Market in England. A large stone tank is maintained at this market for the purpose of washing the cattle before they are driven to slaughter. We show a large herd being driven through the water. A beautiful piece of photography, and very fine water effects as the large animals wallow through the tank.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096913</url></doc>
