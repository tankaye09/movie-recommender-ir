<plot>Murli (Rajnikanth) and Prabhu (Kamal) are owner and manager respectively, of an advertising agency in Madras. Prabhu has been raised by Murli's family, and feels greatly indebted to them. Prabhu is in love with Padma (Sripriya), but a misunderstanding leads them apart. In the meantime, Murli meets and falls in love with Padma. This is one of the better Rajni-Kamal collaborations, though one can see how it could have been a much better film. The film has its fair share of corny moments, though all three protagonist are fairly good in this 70s bell-bottom-fest. The relationship between Prabhu and Padma in the later part of the film is an interesting, someone will write a graduate thesis on this someday.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?259825</url></doc>
