<plot>The film opens on a typical scene of musicians performing in a club. The audience is frozen in adulation, the musicians perform in a bubble of their own music. Suddenly, the guitarist left hand flies off, landing somewhere in the crowd. Panicked, the guitarist searches the audience frantically for his hand. Amidst the shoes, boots, sneakers and legs, the left hand makes a dash for the outside door. The guitarist follows, but cannot fight through in time to reach his hand. Escaping to the outside world, the hand is free to roam the world. Crossing suburbs, deserts, oceans, frozen tundras and even the moon, the guitarist is tireless in the pursuit of his hand. Meanwhile, the left hand goes on a jaunty vacation. London, Paris, and Tokyo are all on the itinerary. While the hand is busy taking snapshots, the musician must pursue his hand to even Earth's moon. After making a crash landing to earth, the musician follows his left hand back to the club they started in!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412140</url></doc>
