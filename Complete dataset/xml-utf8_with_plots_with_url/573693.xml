<plot>Every delivery day, 83 year-old Lethe waits at her mailbox for the mailman to arrive. Widowed at a young age, she now lives alone in her house in a rural Utah neighborhood that her father built and her husband Francis fixed up. She expectantly walks to the mailbox hoping for cards and letters from her family, but none have arrived for many months. At least joking with Mike, the friendly mailman, eases her loneliness a bit. Her caring neighbors Sharon and Rachel also help, and 5 year-old Rachel often comes to visit, the highlight of Lethe's lonely day. On the phone with Lethe's far-away daughter, Sharon says she should write and visit more, but Myra only talks about sending a letter detailing plans to put Lethe in a rest home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573693</url></doc>
