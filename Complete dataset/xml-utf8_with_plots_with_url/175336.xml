<plot>Mothers and daughters - and women trying to survive in the city. Eliana, a young woman from Sumatra who's been in Jakarta for five years, goes on a night-long odyssey with her mother, Bunda, from whom she's been estranged five years. It's been a tough day for Eli: she's fended off unwanted overtures from a man at work, the rent is due, and her housemate of three years, Heni, seems to have abandoned her. Heni is Eli's anchor, like a sister, and her leaving plus her mother's arrival has Eli in a state. Her mother in tow, they hire a cab and start the search for Heni. By daybreak, Eli will have some answers and, perhaps, new-found strength.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175336</url></doc>
