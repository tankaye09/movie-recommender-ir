<plot>The National Forest System was created to protect the remainder of the great woodland ecosystems that once covered America. But something has gone terribly wrong in our National Forests. Wilderness: The Last Stand, filmed in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, scrutinizes the performance of the US Forest Service. While neighbors quarrel and politicians dance, the ancient and irreplaceable forests of America are gradually being destroyed. Truly a call to action, the film asks: with 95% of our native forests already gone, who will care for these lands?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657156</url></doc>
