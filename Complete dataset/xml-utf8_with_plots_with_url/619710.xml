<plot>In this amazing film full of magic the director will take you into a fabulous journey into the world of manifestation and the power of intention. After quitting his job at Nickelodeon (MTV Networks) Oren Stambouli decided that he was going to follow the flow of live to find people around the world that were pursuing their dreams. He understood that in order for this film to have an effect on people he had to find every day people pursuing "impossible" dreams and while shooting the film they will achieve them. On top of that he had an extra challenge; he didn't have a camera, a budget or even a script. But he had a story to tell and nothing was going to stop him from achieving his own dream. Welcome to Trust 22, were believing in a dream is the first step to seeing it, and not the last one. Special interviews with Singer/Songwriter Ricardo Montaner, who has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide. Latin Grammy winner and Grammy Nominee Nestor Torres &amp; Journalist and radio host Eli Bravo.
