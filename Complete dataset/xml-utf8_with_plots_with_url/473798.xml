<plot>Orphaned Leela lives with her cruel aunt, Rangilibai; cousin, Kaushalya; and uncle. When Rangilibai arranges Kaushalya's marriage to a wealthy landlord, Leela agrees to go with her as a maid as part of her dowry. But things change for the better for Leela, when the landlord rejects Kaushalya and decides to get married to Leela. As a result Leela gets married and moves into the landlord's house. Then things take a turn for the worse, when Leela is accused of having a lover, and is asked to leave. She goes to Rangilibai's house, but is shunned and kicked out. Alone, helpless, she comes upon a distant relative named Gaman Singh, who takes her in to live with him and his wife, Swarupbai. When Leela is asked to beg for alms, she refuses, and Swarupbai blinds her with special eye-drops. Then a blinded Leela is led through the streets and made to sit daily near the steps of a temple singing and begging for alms. It looks like fate has chosen this profession for Leela, and there appears to be no way out of this vicious circle for a blind young woman, who has been shunned by her husband and relatives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473798</url></doc>
