<plot>When the oppressive Patil of Sarlaj abuses Babaji and his brother because of their low caste, the duo organize their community and turn into bandits, and force the Patil to apologize. While Babaji gives up being a bandit, and re-locates to live with his wife, Kondli, and son, Umaji, in another village, his brother continues being a bandit. Both Babaji and Kondli will face more challenges when Umaji refuses to work and instead wants to sing and dance to the tunes of the Lavhnis along with a danseuse, Bhingri, leaving his wife at home alone, not realizing the example he will be setting for his son, Tatya, and the scandal this will create in the community.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355672</url></doc>
