<plot>King David was renowned for his wisdom. On his deathbed, he anoints his younger son, Solomon, to be King of Israel. Solomon's older brother tries to wrest away the crown. But Solomon displays God-given wisdom and courage when he confronts his brother, saying, "If I must be king I will not live in fear. Kill me now if that is your plan, or else go home and never challenge God's will again." Faced with Solomon's courage, his brother says he will obey God's will. Solomon prays to God for the wisdom of King David, confiding, "I feel no wiser than a little child." The Lord appears to Solomon and tells him, "Solomon, because thou asked for wisdom to do good, and not for personal gain, I will give you a wise and understanding heart. Behold, there shall be none wiser than you." Solomon's wisdom is soon put to the test when two women appear at his court. Both claim to be the mother of a small infant. Solomon calls for a sword and orders that the child be cut in two. "Give each mother one half," he declares. One woman says, "We must obey the will of the King." The other woman cries out, "The child is hers! I lied! Please, give the child to her." Solomon gives the child to the second woman, saying, "A true mother will do anything to save the life of her child." From every nation they come to seek the wisdom of Solomon, and the greatness of Israel is increased. Solomon lives for many years and, to show his gratitude, builds a great temple to God's glory. Background: Wisdom always demands courage. Fortunately, these gifts from God come together. God tells us that He will bless us with the strength we need, if we come to him as Solomon did - as a child - and put our complete trust in Him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?505426</url></doc>
