<plot>Modern technology has affected most urban people of the world, so they now have more similarities than differences. But geographical environments also continue to influence the way people live, especially in rural and traditional areas. This film uniquelly compares the FOOD in three areas: the tropics of Samoa, the desert of Pakistan, and the mountains of Japan, showing how they are different, and how the people have adapted to their use.
