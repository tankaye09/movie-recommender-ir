<plot>A most successful and animated portrait of the arrival of the Hohenzollern at Port Victoria has been secured by us. The vessel is first seen majestically steaming along side the pier, after which a close view is obtained of the German Ambassador, the English Court officials, etc., etc., as they leave the vessel and come directly towards the camera. His Imperial Majesty then leaves the ship, saluting as he walks up the gangway, an excellent close portrait being secured. The film closes with the Commander of the Hohenzollern standing at salute while the crew give three cheers for the Emperor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046120</url></doc>
