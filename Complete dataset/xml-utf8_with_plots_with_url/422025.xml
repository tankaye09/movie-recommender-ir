<plot>Taken from the balcony of the Hotel de Paris, almost opposite the famous Monte Carlo Casino, konwn through the entire world as the greatest gambling resort in existence. As the camera is slowly revolved, it brings into view the beautiful palm gardens and many of the grand buildings. The picture ends showing the grand entrance to the Casino, and many people are seen entering and leaving the building. Very fine photographically, and an interesting subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422025</url></doc>
