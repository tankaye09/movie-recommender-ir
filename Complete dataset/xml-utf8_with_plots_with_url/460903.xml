<plot>The Indians come to their evening camp by the side of a forest stream. After a drink of clear water, they tie the little girl to a tree and prepare for their night's rest. The trappers are close upon them however, and with a wild yell the white men hurl themselves upon the Indians. A terrific hand-to-hand combat ensues, and the Indians are slain remorselessly. The little girl is quickly released from her bonds and, as the picture ends, she is in the arms of one of the brave trappers who have rescued her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?460903</url></doc>
