<plot>There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was ever produced or distributed at this time. Most likely, it is a working title for another film which was eventually released under another title. Both the title and the alleged release date (4 December 1920) are bogus, coming to us from the error-filled pages of Richard E. Braff's The Universal Silents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219266</url></doc>
