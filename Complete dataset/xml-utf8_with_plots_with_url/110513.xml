<plot>On the edge of the Antartic Circle, in the years after World War I, a steam ship approaches a desolate island far from all shipping lanes. On board is a young man, on his way to assume the lonely post of weather observer, to live in solitude for a year at the end of the world. But on shore he finds no trace of the man whom he has been sent to replace, just a deranged castaway who has witnessed a horror he refuses to name. The rest is forest, a deserted cabin, rocks, silence, and the surrounding sea. And then night begins to fall...Albert Sánchez Piñol's Cold Skin is one of the most unsettling works of contemporary Spanish fiction, a tour de force of dark resonance and sexual anxiety.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110513</url></doc>
