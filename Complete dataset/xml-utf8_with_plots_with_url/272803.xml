<plot>An ardent devotee of Devi Maa Mohata (also known as Devi Maa Renuka), Pooja lives a middle-classed lifestyle along with her widower father in Mohata Gaon. One day a wealthy man, Tatya Saheb Deshmukh, visits them, informs them that his son, Abhishek, has fallen in love with Pooja. A short discussion later, the marriage is finalized, takes place, and Pooja re-locates to live with the Deshmukh family. She will soon realize that her in-laws had not approved of her, but had instead wanted Abhishek to get married to his live-in cousin, Hema; soon she will be accused of assaulting and killing her mother-in-law, Savitri; she will be referred to as a harbinger of bad luck when Abhishek will be involved in a motor vehicle accident and be unable to sire children.
