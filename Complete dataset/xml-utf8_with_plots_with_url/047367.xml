<plot>Once upon a time, a cruise on the QE2 was the ultimate in luxury, available only to the wealthy. But times have changed and the ship is filled with passengers from all walks of life, nearly all English and nearly all elderly. Ethel and Alice rarely leave the ship to see the ports of the Mediterranean. The Catos, who met on a cruise 43 years ago, spend most of their time researching marine history in the library. New Yorker Monroe sits on the afterdeck, remembering his fallen comrades from D-Day while still harbouring dreams of finding the love of his life. Meanwhile widowed Margaret, who loves ballroom dancing, must patiently wait her turn for a dance with one of the ship's 'gentleman hosts'. A bittersweet portrait of love, ageing, Englishness and of home away from home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?047367</url></doc>
