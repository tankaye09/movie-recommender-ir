<plot>A camera is mounted on the front of a train, focused straight ahead. We are in a tunnel, with light coming closer - a billboard for Chas H. Fletcher products is visible. Then, we are out of the tunnel into sunlight; we pass the billboard and two steam whistles, and the train curves to the left: the Brooklyn Bridge is in front of us. We travel across it, pedestrians visible to the left of the train, horse-drawn carriages to the right. After about 30 seconds, virtually the only thing we can see is the iron lattice work on either side and above the train. After a full minute of this, a bit of Manhattan comes into view; the frame is dominated by buildings at the end of the bridge.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393983</url></doc>
