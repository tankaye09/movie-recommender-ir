Featuring dramatized reconstructions, period imagery and the latest 3-D computer graphics, the program follows the dramatic course of events, including the Battle Of Bordino and the cruel 'Retreat From Moscow' which claimed over half a million lives. The program also draws extensively on spectacular scenes from the Oscar-winning Russian film "War and Peace." Narrated by Robert Powell.
