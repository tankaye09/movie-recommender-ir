<plot>A young Marine Sergeant, James Winslow, struggles to come to terms with the death of his estranged father. His inability to grieve, to turn to family members, to process and deal with a slew of new emotions, forces him to compensate in other, more destructive ways. Instead of his loved ones, James turns to alcohol, and after causing an accident while driving under the influence, finds himself on the verge of being drummed out of the Marine Corps. In steps Father Graham Mercer, the base chaplain and a dear family friend. He convinces the powers that be to give James one more chance. Working alongside Father Mercer, James comes to terms with his family and with his grief.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575154</url></doc>
