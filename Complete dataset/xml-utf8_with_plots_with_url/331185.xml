<plot>A train is seen to leave a station after which the film is taken from the moving train. It passes through wooded countryside, dotted with houses. Verging upon rocky scenery, it enters a series of tunnels. Emerging from the tunnels, the train continues along the track bordered on either side by rock faces, and on to the river Bourne into a valley containing the Sejourne Viaduct. The journey ends overlooking a deep valley with a town situated upon the opposite hill-slope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?331185</url></doc>
