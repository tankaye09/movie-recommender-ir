<plot>Sema and Orhan being head over heels in love, get married... Yet, Sema's mother Leman is against their marriage right from the beginning. She also doesn't want her son-in-law's father Sermet, because years ago Leman, was about to marry grandpa Sermet but in the last moment he preferred Leman for another woman and left her. Thus, he turned on the verge of getting married to her. However, years after Leman's daughter Sema, gets married to Sermet's son Orhan. It's a nice favor of destiny! Leman does everything to separate them and finally reaches her goal. Thus, the couple often quarrels out of jealousy and gets separated. On one side we have Sema's front under the commander ship of Leman who opposes their marriage. On the other side is Orhan's front, under the commander ship of grandpa Sermet who is for their marriage. The most important characters in this battle are Orhan and Sema's children Elif and Serkan. Both of them get united with their grand fight with all the power they have to save their parent's marriage. With its superb writing credits the serial is a real burst of laughter!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041625</url></doc>
