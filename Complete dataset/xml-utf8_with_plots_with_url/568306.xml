<plot>On her deathbed, Candice Klein accidentally asks the question, "What did I ever do to deserve this?" The answer is far more complex than you might imagine. From the adult film studios of Burbank to Saigon, Candice Klein has worked her way across the map cigarette in mouth. Her hatred of the world is only matched by her love of musicals the good, old fashioned American ones (of course). It is her destiny to sing in the movies a final wish before the afterlife. Will she get it, or will death get her first?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568306</url></doc>
