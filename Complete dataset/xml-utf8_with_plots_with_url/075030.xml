<plot>Metaphors and analogies for writer's block presented as bad dreams and slices of life. Tom, a writer, is awakened by a tambourine-playing cross-dresser named Little Stevie who tells Tom's fortune and wants him to dance. His girlfriend Cassie alternates between calling him her hero and imperiously demanding that he cook. Tom tells Stevie he can't dance and tells Cassie he can't cook. And so it goes: demands he can't meet. And how, asks a friend, is that writer thing going?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075030</url></doc>
