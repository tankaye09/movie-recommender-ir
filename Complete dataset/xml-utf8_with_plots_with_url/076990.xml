<plot>When scientist Jack Graham returns from the jungles of Peru, he has a new leap in pharmaceutical medicine in his possession. Hunted by those who will stop at nothing to get their hands on it, he is pursued by a pair of hired assassins named Mr Smith and Mr Jones. When Jack inadvertently involves botanist Alicia, soon her life is in danger too. Acting on an impulse he's never felt before, Smith finds himself protecting Alicia. Confused by his own actions, the only thing for certain is that to save this woman he has only just met; Smith will have to take on Jones, the most ruthless professional in the game. He also has a lot of explaining to do to his boss, who has something very particular in mind for her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076990</url></doc>
