<plot>The life of a garden after dark: Balinese dancers sway on the petals of flowers, Russian singers perform in a lily. The Nightgardener brings together disparate images that capture the essence of our collective unconscious and plays these images on floral screens. The Night Gardner explores the idea of the collective unconscious collected as images appropriated from old educational films, and are projected onto garden plants and then re-photographed. This process re-contextualizes the images, connecting film and gardening through the idea of cultivation: the gardener as cultivator of plants, the filmmaker as cultivator of images and ideas. Through projection, disparate images become connected. Found sounds promote associations between the images, creating a new meaning.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?579482</url></doc>
