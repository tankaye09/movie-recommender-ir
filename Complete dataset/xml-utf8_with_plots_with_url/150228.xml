<plot>Arun Kumar is an orphan who studies in a college in India. Encouraged by the College Principal, Arun excels in his studies, and also takes up singing for important occasions. He has a secret admirer by the name of Seema, who writes songs for him but prefers to remain unknown. Through her songs he becomes popular and wealthy virtually overnight. He marries the College Principal's daughter, Meena, and together they are all set to live their lives harmoniously. Soon Meena gets pregnant, and both propose to name their daughter Seema. Then Seema's Editor, Mr. Verma, tells him that it is time he came to know who Seema really is, and it is then Arun and Meena will have to come to terms as to whether Arun is willing to sacrifice their marriage for the mysterious woman who he worships as a Goddess.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150228</url></doc>
