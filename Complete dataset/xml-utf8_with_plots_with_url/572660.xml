<plot>Captain Merril Stubing (Gavin MacLeod) mans the helm one more time on the deck of the Sky Princess. This two-hour movie just happens to be the last episode of the love boat for a while (That is until Love Boat: The Next Wave came along). In the movie, the ship's bookkeeper becomes a driver for three, clever jewel thieves. A police lieutenant follows them in disguise aboard the ship. Merril is urged by his daughter (Jill Whelan, Vicki) to visit the hotel in Bermuda where the couple had a honeymoon. A new cruise director has eyes for a TV star, but another ship employee also has eyes set on her. Plus Doc has his hands full when he has to care for the ship's chief executive's wife, who happens to be pregnant. All in all, it is just enough fun for the final voyage of The Love Boat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?572660</url></doc>
