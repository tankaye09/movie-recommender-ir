<plot>"This scene opens by showing a pretty cook mixing bread in the kitchen. Jones comes in unexpectedly from a trip and carries a dress suitcase. He inquires for his wife and is told by the cook that she is absent. Jones is hungry and asks for something to eat. The cook is very obliging and Jones becomes unruly, chuckles the cook under the chin. The cook puts her arms around Jones' neck and leaves finger imprints of flour on his back. This is where the trouble commences. Jones' wife suddenly appears and accuses Jones of making love to the cook. Jones denies it. She scornfully points to the finger marks on Jones back. Jones still denies it. The wife becomes angry and seizes the pan of flour and turns it upside down on Jones' head, spoiling his best Sunday clothes. Jones escapes and cook is discharged. This is a very funny picture."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?655816</url></doc>
