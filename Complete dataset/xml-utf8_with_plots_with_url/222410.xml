<plot>Maxim Gorky, novelist, playwright and essayist was the founder of Socialist Realism. Although known principally as a writer, he was also a prominent figure in the Russian Revolution. Gorky was born on March 28, 1868 in Nizhny Novgorod, USSR. Gorky's first short story was published in 1892, and his collection Sketches and Stories (1898) was an instantaneous success, making him famous throughout Russia. Gorky's best works are his autobiographical and literary memoirs. Reminiscences of Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Andreyev (1928) is hailed as his masterpiece.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222410</url></doc>
