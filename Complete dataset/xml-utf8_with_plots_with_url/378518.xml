<plot>This racing game puts players to the task of navigating side-scrolling courses that go up, down, and loop-de-doop through several different environments. The challenge is to come in first in each cup, out-racing the other three players to the finish line by picking up nitro and fuel icons, boosting off jumps to land on platforms that are faster lines in the course. You can even take out your opponents by picking up weapons such as missiles and land-mines, putting them to use when they get a little too close for comfort. Other items are scattered around the tracks, including little guys that'll save your items if you manage to take a spill...normally you'll lose all your power-ups when you crack up after a jump. By successfully completing races, you'll unlock additional tracks and racers with different attributes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?378518</url></doc>
