<plot>"3rd of July" tells the story of two young Iraq war veterans, as they struggle to readjust to their lives in New York. Carter Ballard and Ted Shaw, men from different upbringings, different worlds within the same city, cross paths at the Veterans' Administration as they sort through disputes over their medical benefits. From there, we follow both men through strained interactions with family and friends who don't understand how war has changed them.</plot><plot>"3rd of July" tells the story of two young Iraq war veterans, as they struggle to readjust to their lives in New York.
