<plot>1932 Rural Quebec - Alfred Lippe' (a 5-year-old) sits with his father in the candle lit workshop of his families toy store. His father Barnard Lippe' designs and hand makes all of the toys in the store, as his father before him did. As his father makes a new toy, Alfred plays with a toy airplane. It flies through the air jumping in and out of reality and imagination. He asks his father how he thinks of new toys. His father explains (In French with English subtitles) imagination to him and tells him to never lose it, to cherish it, as one of god's most brilliant gifts. Cut To- Age 17 Alfred has been drafted into the war and his battalion is devastated by an attack, he screams for help but no one is there to help him. Present day Toronto - Jayden Lippe'(a very intelligent but very shy five-year old girl, played by Libby Adams) tries to help Alfred, her newly blind and bed-ridden grandpa, find happiness by helping him regain what was once his most cherished asset, the imagination of his mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?154057</url></doc>
