<plot>It's a still day in the Junkyard. The owner works on his car in the garage as a young boy and girl work outside, moving junk into piles and cleaning. Late a night the boy witnesses something that the man is doing. The boy sees the girl being dragged into the man's quarters. Later in the night, the girl slowly leaves the man's room. The next day it's business as usual and the man gets his car to start. As he takes a break to check on the boy and girl, he notices the boy is not working in his usual spot. The table turns suddenly when the boy takes action against the man with the hope of saving the girl from further abuse. Can he defeat the man and what will he do with their freedom?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281932</url></doc>
