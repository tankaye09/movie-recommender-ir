<plot>One year after the events in Jak 3, Jak and Daxter take up professional racing in a place called Kras City. Joined by their old friends, they are summoned by a woman named Rayne, who is...Krew's daughter? She apologizes to them for her father's actions, and proposes a toast in his memory. She takes out an odd-looking wine bottle, which she said that Krew instructed in his will that his closest associates must drink. After they all take a glass, Rayne brings out a hologram projector, which broadcasts his last message to Jak and company. Krew announces that the wine they drank is poisoned, follow by a maniacal laugh. The only way they can get the antidote is to win Kras City's big vehicle race, in his honor. And so, Jak and Daxter, Ashelin, Torn, Keira, and Sig are pitted against each other in combat racing for the ultimate prize: their life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272936</url></doc>
