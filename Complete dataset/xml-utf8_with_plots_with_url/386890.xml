<plot>Harvey gets fired from his latest dead-end job. In town he gets caught up with a bank-job that goes wrong. The robber collapses at his feet and Harvey ends up with the money. The enigmatic Bruce steps in to help and the pair make their escape with a getaway pint and discuss the future. Harvey wants to open a philosophy caf√© and Bruce agrees to help, having nothing on at the moment. Russell, a somewhat shady contact of Bruce's, provides the venue and all seems to be going well until a demented Don Quixote embroils Harvey in a fracas with a bus and gets a nosy DC Bentham involved. Harvey's paranoia ramps up and joins forces with his ever-present self-doubt which cripples his forward progress. Bruce pushes on regardless, intent on doing it alone. Another run-in with Don Quixote clears Harvey's head and he comes round in time to help Bruce with the opening. At the inaugural event all the forces that have shaped Harvey's recent history come together in an explosive conflagration that serves to reinforce the philosophy of getting on with things before it's too late.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?386890</url></doc>
