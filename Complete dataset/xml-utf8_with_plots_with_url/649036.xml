<plot>We wished for a child. Following difficulties in conceiving we had begun fertility medical tests. The problem came from me. We embarked a series of treatments that succeeded in creating a twins pregnancy. But then a rare problem in one of the fetuses was diagnosed. We were advised to a selective termination procedure. Birth was no longer an obvious thing. "We said, No crying" filmed from a male's perspective accompanying the director as he confronts his fears of a lost masculinity. And reveals a unique relationship that struggles to manage itself with contradicting emotions of guilt, blame, support and hope.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649036</url></doc>
