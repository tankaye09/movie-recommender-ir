<plot>A documentary study on the phenomenon of SUICIDE. A thorough analysis of the problem's threateningly increasing frequency worldwide. The film puts up an alert, which has never been heard so far, anywhere: Suicide is an increasing threat, with causes rooted very deep down into the spiritual foundations of modern mankind. It is a life-destroying force much more powerful and efficient than homicide - both quantitatively (the number of suicides exceeds almost by two that of murders), and qualitatively (as it threatens life from deep within rather than from the outside). It is the most vigorous, horrifying denial of Life that could possibly exist. A modern day man loses the meaning of life as easily as roulette player loses a stake. Why, how could that be possible? ... On Suicide's mission is to raise enough deep, alarming, essential questions that very few people dare ask themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410724</url></doc>
