<plot>This is an amusing trick picture. A young man is making love to the doctor's daughter. The doctor comes in suddenly and the young woman tries to conceal her lover by hiding him on the dissecting table. The doctor takes his surgical instruments and cuts off the young man's head, placing it on a shelf beside a skull. The daughter in horror seizes the head and places it back upon the body; whereupon the young man comes to life and kisses her, much to the amazement of the old doctor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015049</url></doc>
