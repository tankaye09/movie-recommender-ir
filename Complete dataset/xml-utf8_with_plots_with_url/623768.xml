<plot>The first time Ajay saw Pia, she served him drinks. She affected him more than the alcohol, and he found true love. He was a leading psychiatrist, but she messed up his mind. The first time Pia saw Ajay, he had too much to drink. She watched him make a fool of himself, and was relieved when he passed out. She was a woman who followed her heart, but despite his claims of true love, she had made up her mind. Thus began the story of Ajay and Pia. A love story, that begins at sea. Ajay and Pia develop a strong and special bond. In each other, they find an anchor. They rush into marriage, despite the advice and failing relationships of their friends. But no marriages can be complete without problems, and Ajay and Pia have also have to face hurdles, some of which seem insurmountable.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623768</url></doc>
