Raymond is forced to do petty little unimportant, non-bellman related tasks at the resort. Merrilee Kauphman pays Raymond for sex and Raymond learns Merrilee has been a Swinger with his in-laws. Raymond wants Merrilee out of the Resort. He asks his father-in-law to make him Manager and to take Merrilee off his hands.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?527179</url></doc>
