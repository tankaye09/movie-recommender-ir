<plot>"Here is a film that everybody wants to see, especially those who live outside Philadelphia, and even those who do flock to the yard whenever a ship is launched or even only to pay a visit to one of the most exciting plants of its kind. Ships of the merchantman class as well as battleships, monitors and cruisers are here seen in all stages of completion. Everything is true to nature. A beautiful, interesting subject."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640322</url></doc>
