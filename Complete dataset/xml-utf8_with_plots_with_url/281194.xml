<plot>In the early morning hours of January 24, 1941 Joss Erroll, the 22nd Earl of Erroll, was shot through the head while his car was parked on a road just outside of Nairobi, Kenya. Erroll was known as a ladies man and he had for some time been having an affair with Diana Broughton, the young wife of Sir Jock Broughton. Their affair had become quite well known and Broughton had apparently accepted the situation having announced that he was leaving for Ceylon. After the killing, Broughton was tried and acquitted of the murder. In this dramatic re-creation of the events leading up to the shooting, Julian Fellowes adds commentary and context to the events. He identifies the killer and states that he knows for a fact this is correct as it is based on information provided to him by an impeccable source (which he will not name).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?281194</url></doc>
