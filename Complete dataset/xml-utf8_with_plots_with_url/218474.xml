<plot>When a man gets arrested he asks for his lawyer, when a woman gets arrested she asks for her children. The State of New Jersey's women's prison is home to more than eleven hundred women offenders over the age of 16. Eighty percent of these women are mothers upon arrival, some become mothers during their sentences. "Going Home," allows these women to tell their stories, it is a window into the lives of these women and their children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218474</url></doc>
