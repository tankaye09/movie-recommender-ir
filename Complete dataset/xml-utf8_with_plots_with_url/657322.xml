<plot>Joe has just been ditched by the girl he loves, so has been out shopping and arrives home with a large shopping bag. This contains, pen, paper, whisky, tablets, gun, and rope, because he has decided to end it all as he can't live without her. The problem is he can't make his mind up which way will be quickest, but also hurt the least. As he makes his mind up he drinks the whisky and one by one eliminates the gun, tablets and rope as he is too scared to use them. He finally decides to gas himself as that will be painless, so turns the gas on. Whilst he is waiting he drinks more whisky and becomes very drunk and starts wondering if perhaps she is not worth killing himself for as there are plenty more fish in the sea. Whilst he thinks about this, he lights a cigarette. BANG, the decision has been made for him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657322</url></doc>
