<plot>Ethan's new apartment is giving him trouble: things don't work as they should, and the landlord seems like a real sleazeball. So he and his boyfriend Jasper plan a romantic evening together to ease his mind, complete with scary movies, popcorn, and heavy petting. The old building creaks and groans around them, but they take no notice. As they kiss and caress, something stirs within the deep dark. Something hellishly old and insatiably hungry. And soon it will be coming for them, with burning eyes and razor-sharp claws.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260962</url></doc>
