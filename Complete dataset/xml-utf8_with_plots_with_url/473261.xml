<plot>When Lee Jin-woo rescued Su-eun from a fire they both defied the odds in surviving. He fell in love with her older sister, Soo-jeong Lim, who now desires the brave fireman to propose marriage thinking that this will make him less fearless in facing the flames and lessen her greatest fear. He wishes to do so, but his romantic streak causes him to seek the proper moment. Su-eun works as a "character" in an amusement park. Her face was scared in the fire, and in addition she is a deaf mute. Feeling free to be more forward when in costume behind a large "Raggedy-Ann" head, she approaches a handsome artist who frequents the park to paint. He starts to come infatuated with her, despite never having seen her face or heard her voice. She starts to fall in love with him. Choi Suk-hyun informs her boyfriend, Jung Ha-seok, that she wishes to break up for he is still unemployed after 3 years and she cannot face a future of poverty. He vows to get a job to reverse her feelings, and when a stranger enlists him to tell her boyfriend a final "goodbye" on the phone, he decides that he can turn doing this into an online business and starts a "separation agency." Busy with her career, Eom Jung-hwa neglects her young son Park Hwi-chan, and he becomes a problem at school. When she is hospitalized he becomes happier since he can visit her anytime and she has time to spend with him. Separation looms as a possible outcome for all of these inter-twined souls who who live and love in Seoul, Korea.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473261</url></doc>
