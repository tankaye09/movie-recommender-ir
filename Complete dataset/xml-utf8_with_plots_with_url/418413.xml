<plot>William Ross is a relocated and disgruntled Australian living unhappily in New York City. His life spins out of control when an unusual cell phone appears in his mail, bringing unexpected power and inexplicable tragedy. As William attempts to reconcile the unlikely turn in his life he suffers the severe impact of violence at a distance. Issues of modern-day alienation and the implicit loss of responsibility collide with emotional disconnection to emphasize the challenges of our detached times. Technology and telecommunication seem only to take him further from truly connecting as he scrambles to get control. The very device that symbolizes connectedness only emphasizes the distance he feels and the desperation of his efforts to regain meaning in the vacuous life that he once believed in.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418413</url></doc>
