<plot>Virendra Pratap Singh lives a wealthy, yet careless lifestyle in India. When his father passes away, he hopes to inherit the entire estate and wealth, but is unable to do so due to a stipulation in the will that he must join a military academy as per family traditions, and failure to do so may forfeit his claim to this inheritance. He reluctantly joins the National Defence Academy, expects to break every possible rule, and be discharged. His training officer is Major Jasbir Singh Rana, who takes it upon himself not to discharge Virendra under any circumstance, even when Virendra runs away twice. Then Virendra's plans change when he meets with and falls in love with Nisha, who lives a very wealthy lifestyle with her gangster brother, Shankar. Virendra decides to continue training so that he can be close to Nisha, however, Shankar has other plans for Nisha as he wants to get wed to fellow-gangster, Parshuram Bihari's son, Vicky. When Nisha openly declares her love for Virendra during her engagement with Vicky, Shankar forgives her and embraces Virendra as his future brother-in-law, neither Nisha nor Virendra know that Shankar has a devious plan that may leave Virendra gravely injured and possibly handicapped for the rest of his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?353109</url></doc>
