<plot>Alice, a woman who could easily be the love child of Jeff 'The dude' Lebowski, is a slacker who happened to win the lottery. An event that had absolutely no effect on her life whatsoever aside from the fact that she can now afford to be comfortably unemployed and spend even more time doing nothing but hanging out in her apartment all day watching movies and TV, playing video games and occasionally ordering random expensive items she doesn't know what to do with. Returning home after a peculiar Elvis sighting, she stumbles into Limbo and finds herself in a waiting room amongst long dead celebrities, including the 'Real first man to walk on the moon', disgruntled with their lack of fandom in the afterlife, the slow corruption of their once exclusive waiting room by z-list reality TV show stars and longing to somehow escape back into the real world to reclaim their fame.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398655</url></doc>
