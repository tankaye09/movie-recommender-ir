<plot>Alfred Damm is an unsuccessful screenwriter living in Graz, Austria. After his latest screenplay is rejected by a producer Alfred gets depressed and starts to suffer from a writer's block. One day his friend (and successful screenwriter) Michael visits him at home and invites him to a little party. There Alfred meets a young, pretty girl. They both leave the party after Michael starts to fight with his wife Christiane. The girl tries to cheer Alfred up and in the end she gives him a kiss. She leaves and Alfred smiles (for the first time in the film). Maybe his writer's block is over now...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?480984</url></doc>
