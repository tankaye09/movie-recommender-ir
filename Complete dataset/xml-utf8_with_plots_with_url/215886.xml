<plot>Which is more unlikely? Meeting a single, straight, reasonably attractive, willing-to-commit guy? Or discovering a secret cache of magic books? For librarian Jane Madison, neither has a shot in hell of coming true - until the day she finds a hidden room. Now she's done a bit of experimenting, and found a spell that makes her irresistible to the opposite sex - even those who have previously ignores her. Jane's not willing to let go of this fantastic new life. Though she wonders about having relationships that aren't "real" - she's having too much fun to stop. And after all, no one ever said being a witch was easy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215886</url></doc>
