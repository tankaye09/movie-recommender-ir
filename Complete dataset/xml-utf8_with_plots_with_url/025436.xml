<plot>Joe thinks he's got what it takes to teach Hip-Hop Culture to middle school kids. His boss doesn't. Hip-Hop is a multi-million dollar industry and Joe's not about to let his students get left behind. Joe learns, however, that teaching is tougher than it looks when he's confronted by Pat, the afterschool administrator. Pat explains that he expected Joe's lesson plan to be a little more "positive." From teaching young girls how to pole dance to teaching young boys how to swear like the best of them in an MC battle, Joe must confront his reasons for teaching this...this...Hip-Hop. In doing so, Joe is forced to confront his own issues of street credibility and his own sordid past.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025436</url></doc>
