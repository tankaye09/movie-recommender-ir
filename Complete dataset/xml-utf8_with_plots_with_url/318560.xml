After her birthday, their lives are shattered by the entry of Pratap's brother, Thakur Vikram Singh, who kills Pratap, and his mother, but fails to kill Lavina, who, with Anita's help, manages to escape. He sends several thugs and goons to try and apprehend them, amongst them are a city thug, Bhushan, and a bandit from Chambal, Bhairav Singh. Bhushan manages to ensnare both, but Lambu Dada comes to their rescue. Neither Lavina nor Anita are aware that Lambu is a hired killer, and his assignment is to bring in both of them alive, hand them over to Vikram, then kill them, and then collect the remainder of his fee.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?318560</url></doc>
