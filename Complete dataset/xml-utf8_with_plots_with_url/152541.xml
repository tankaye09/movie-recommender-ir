<plot>This is not your father's road trip. From pristine roadless areas to concrete jungles, follow filmmaker Eric Bendick as he tours North America, dodging Yellowstone's grizzlies and Miami's taxicabs, and highlighting sustainable road projects and wildlife corridors for the 21st century. Roads are the largest human artifact on the planet; they have fragmented wild landscapes, ushered in the 'age of urban sprawl,' and challenged our bedrock sense of community. But as the transportation crisis appears to be spiraling out of control, a new generation of ecologists, engineers, city-planners, and everyday citizens are transforming the future of the American road. 'Division Street' is at once a portrait of both ancient wilderness and new technologies as well as a call for connectivity, innovation, and solutions to shape the emerging green transportation movement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152541</url></doc>
