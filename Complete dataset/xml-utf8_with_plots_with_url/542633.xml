<plot>Jerry Sierra lives life with only one thing in mind, His music. Although the heir to his late fathers multimillion-dollar estate, he cares for none of it. His passions and plans are simple - change the world with Rock n' Roll. Everything seems to be coming together until he stumbles upon an impostor living the upscale life he denied so long ago and that is even dating his ex-fianc√©! Curious and a bit suspicious, Jerry starts to investigate only to make more distributing discoveries along the way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?542633</url></doc>
