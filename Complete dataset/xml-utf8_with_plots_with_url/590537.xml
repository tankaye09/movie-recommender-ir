<plot>It's Seymour's birthday...or is it? And who's that little girl? Maybe faith, maybe hope, but definitely not justice, as Seymour Baruch can find no justice in life. Day after day, Baruch raises a cocked gun to his head, playing a game of Russian roulette with the devil's advocate. Yet, day after day, Baruch is rejected from hell, heaven, or whatever God has to offer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?590537</url></doc>
