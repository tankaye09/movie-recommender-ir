<plot>"SAD" is an eye opener. There is more wrong with the health system than we are allowed to know. The health system is where it is today because the FDA and AMA have driven it in that direction. "SAD" is a wake up call for Americans to get off their fast food butts and eat right. Even though SAD is labeled as a fictional story, this movie is based on actual real hard facts, true stories and today's current event headlines. FREE PRESS? If you say so. But it's a known fact that big pharmaceutical companies have paid a ton of money to control the "free press." Did you know? Nearly every doctor in the United States accepts gifts of some sort from pharmaceutical companies, but in many cases there is no benefit to patients, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers surveyed 1,662 U.S. doctors and found that 94 percent of them reported "some type of relationship with the pharmaceutical industry." Did you also know? Diabetes caused by pharmaceuticals? On July 31st, Patrick Bills filed a lawsuit against Bristol-Myers Squibb claiming that its drug, Tequin, the brand name of gatafloxacin, caused his diabetes. The New England Journal of Medicine reported on March 30, 2006 that gatifloxacin causes both hypo- and hyperglycemia, the precursor of diabetes. Is this drug unique, or is it possible that many drugs increase the chance of this debilitating and fatal disease.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472314</url></doc>
