<plot>The goal of Bode Miller Alpine Racing is to race down the course as fast as possible while avoiding obstacles that can cause you to crash. After selecting your event, course and skis, you begin at the gate, where you will need to time three keypresses to build up power. Each keypress increases your power percentage, and if you nail all three lights, you will get 100 percent power at launch. Player control of the skier is intuitive, requiring only three keypad buttons, Left to turn left, Right to turn right, and OK to go into a tight tuck, recover when off balance, or reach when near the finish line. While the controls are simple, gameplay requires quick decision making. The key to winning the race is through effective turning, quick timing of turns and tight tucks, and strategic use of energy. All controls and rules are explained on screen and are easy to learn for rapid play. A multiplayer option allows two players to play against each other using the same phone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?077537</url></doc>
