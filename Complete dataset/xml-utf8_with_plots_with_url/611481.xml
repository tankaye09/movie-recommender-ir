<plot>An enchanting look at the lives of a Japanese couple, based on the real-life diary extracts of the husband. He is a slightly offbeat photographer, a profession that grew out of his publishing a book of portraits of Yoko, his pretty wife, to whom he is devoted but doesn't entirely understand. She is highly strung, in fact a little off-balance, particularly as she forces her maternal attentions on neighbour's 8 year-old boy. The story is largely told in retrospect, after Yoko's death, and includes a variety of friends and incidental characters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?611481</url></doc>
