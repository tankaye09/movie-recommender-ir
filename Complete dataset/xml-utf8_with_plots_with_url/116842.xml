<plot>This is a typical country scene. Silas Haymow calls on Lucinda Cornstalk, and they have a real nice chat. She offers him a cup of tea and they pledge themselves to be true. Finally Silas waxes warm and proceeds to embrace the shy Lucinda, much to her enjoyment. Exceedingly good photography and a comical situation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?116842</url></doc>
