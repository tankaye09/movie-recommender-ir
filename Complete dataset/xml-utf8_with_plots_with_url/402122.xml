<plot>Here is a novelty. A child is seen sitting on the ground playing, when a number of chicks rush upon him. He urges them to go away without effect. He is joined later by his older sister, who tries to pacify him, all to no purpose. When the Roosters and Hens approach he is scared to such an extent that his sister chases them all away, fearing that he will go into a spasm. Very good and striking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?402122</url></doc>
