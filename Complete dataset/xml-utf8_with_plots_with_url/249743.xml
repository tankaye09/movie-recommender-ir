<plot>Insp. Randy Tuazon (Rudy Fernandez) led the raid of the satanic cult who were responsible for killing virgin women. They thought they had already destroyed the cult when they killed its leader, Remo Torres. Several years later, panic strikes the quiet town when a priest is mysteriously killed. When Randy's search for the lead suspect results in vain, Paula (Ruffa Mae Quinto), a psychic, volunteers to help him. Randy shuns Paula when she predicts that apart from the religious officials, one of his friends will also be killed. Her predictions, however, come true prompting him to accept her offer to help. Together they must uncover the mystery behind the killings and bring back the peace in the town.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249743</url></doc>
