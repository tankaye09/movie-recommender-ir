<plot>In today's overhyped art scene, it's refreshing to simply enjoy art without pretentiousness or snobbery. Art Attack renews the art experience with an exciting journey through the world's coolest art museums. In each episode, art historian and unpredictable southerner Lee Sandstead spotlights the top five must-see pieces at one iconic art space such as New York's Metropolitan. Lee weaves his strong command of art with passionate storytelling and surprising facts. Lee initially came to art as a self-taught admirer, and his honest enthusiasm brings art to life. You'll be disarmed by Lee's obsession and enthralled by his view of what makes a work of art great.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?046349</url></doc>
