<plot>Tango is not just a dance. It's a way of life. And Buenos Aires is its heart. In the scorching Tango Clubs and smoky dens of this sultry city dancers, musicians and tango aficionados fill the night with the passion and promise of music like no other. Constantly chasing a Tango high. Pianist LINDA-LEE THOMAS, bass player MILES FOXX-HILL and guitarist, EDWARD HENDERSON, members of Canadian Tango ensemble TANGISSIMO, set off on a pilgrimage to Argentina to worship at the altar of Tango. Writer/Director Shel Piercy documents their sizzling journey as TANGISSIMO heads into the heart of Buenos Aires. In throbbing clubs and elegant dance halls these three musicians fuse their own ardor with the power and pathos of Tango's musical legends. Let the rhythm take you on a sensual journey as Chasing the Tango High uncovers the heartbeat and surging passion that is Tango.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?100825</url></doc>
