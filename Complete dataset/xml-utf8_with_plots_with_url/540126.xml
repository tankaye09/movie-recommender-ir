<plot>Academy AwardÂ® winner Michael Blake (author of Dances with Wolves) takes the viewer on a road trip to explore the places in the American West that have been scenes of particular significance in the history of the Native American peoples and their encounters with the immigrant races who were invading their territories in the mid to late 1800's (1854 - 1890). Along the way Michael Blake ventures through western Americana giving the viewer a feel of the true west and a genuine American road trip. The American West, On the Road with Michael Blake lends a new perspective on this history bringing to light the undercurrents of conflict that are still witnessed today. While most historic shows focus on the past or present this series combines both in a visually engaging, musically driven narrative blend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540126</url></doc>
