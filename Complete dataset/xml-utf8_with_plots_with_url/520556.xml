<plot>One can say that cinema is also only an artificial organism - human life in another form. In "Sugo" a vinyl sample roars and rustles. white noise deep in the cellar. The moving images which later make their appearance come from two different worlds. Master of ceremonies Hannes Langeder runs them parallel to each other. Black and white pulsating branches in tissue which appear to have blood pumping through them as in an X-ray film. Parallel to this two people are doing something strange with spaghetti in a flickering light and animated by pixelation to intense twitching. This opens up the semantic field to which the title of the piece also belongs - fun with food. It hangs from one person^ÃŒs mouth to be flung through the air towards the other. A silent orgy in a bare room lit by flashbulb-like light. An ecstatic secret game, the rules of which are not (yet) accessible. The staccato flow of image and sound last just under three minutes and then the roaring loses its intensity, the film tears, dies. life in another form. One can say, in the end and in spite of minimal production values, "Sugo" looks like science fiction, like artificial intelligence and fresh meat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520556</url></doc>
