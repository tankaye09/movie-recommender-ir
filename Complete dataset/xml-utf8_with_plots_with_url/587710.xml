<plot>Alex is a man with Down syndrome, stuck in a wheelchair since a mysterious fall. Alex is traumatized by his parents: Max, a frustrated composer turned completely mad and violent; and Marie, a cold and hysteric woman. Alex's only friend is his sister Melinda, who's been taking care of him for years. But Melinda, 9 months pregnant, is also maltreated by her parents and about to leave the family home to start a new life - leaving Alex behind. At the peak of the family crisis, a mysterious door appears in the house, at a place where there was nothing before. And everyone who enters it disappears in a terrifying scream. The members of the family discover they're trapped in the house - every exit seems unnaturally locked - and they start disappearing in The Room one after the other. Due to these terrifying events, the family will have to face their most terrible secrets, which will almost make them kill each other. But what mystery is hiding inside The Room?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?587710</url></doc>
