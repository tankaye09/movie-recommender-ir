<plot>This all-digital feature film was directed by its cast, all equipped with cameras and given the story outline. They improvised most of the movie, using the concept of film students seeking out the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock, which had been spotted in L.A. The ghost may also have been involved in a series of bizarre murders. The protagonist (Daniel Hass) also investigates sightings of a strange psychotic woman who lives in a shopping cart and wears a white sheet over her head.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241755</url></doc>
