<plot>The short film begins as the two strangers who met online engage in a slow and awkward dance of getting to know each other after a passionate hook-up. Clyde, the older of the two and the owner of the house, attempts to make Wayne comfortable. Out of politeness, Wayne obliges him in small talks before picking up his clothes and leaving. Upon discovering commonalities between the two, their attraction in each other grows. They flirt and share laughs, and they gradually let their guard down. The turning point of their relationship happens when Wayne finds a photograph of Clyde and his boyfriend. Shocked and incensed, he relentlessly interrogates Clyde, and their exchange deteriorates into a heated and explosive debate as the two men stake out their positions on love, trust and monogamy. As Wayne puts on his final piece of clothing, covering himself up completely, he finally reveals his recent past that explains his impassioned disdain for infidelity. The two men share an unlikely moment of solidarity and empathy, and for the first time, they really see each other.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282100</url></doc>
