<plot>After her divorce, twenty five year old mother of two, Sharon Carter decided to do do something extraordinaary by joining a Roman re-enactment group and enter the arena to fight as "Amazonia" a 1st century Celtic warrior-women from Britain. But Sharon's desire to fight in the arena is tempered when she is told she must use a double headed axe and fight against the male gladiators to be truly authentic. This is a story of Sharon's struggle to win the respect of her peers and fight for the honour of the wooden sword of freedom. Along the journey Sharon learns something about herself and being a single mum in 21st century Brisbane.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216651</url></doc>
