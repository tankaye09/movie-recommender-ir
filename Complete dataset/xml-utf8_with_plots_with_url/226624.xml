At the time of the next summer festival they find a heavilly wounded man just outside the village. Despite the no strangers allowed rule of the village thay take the man in. This is the start of many adventures involving storybook like stills combined with great animation and daft story telling.

While Queen Horn's powers are failing, Flute is found out to be her missing daughter.
