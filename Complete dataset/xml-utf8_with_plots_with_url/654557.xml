<plot>Debbie lives a poor lifestyle in Britain along with her spouse, and three children, two girls and a boy. The neighborhood is predominantly Islamic and there is a Mosque within a stone's throw of their residence. Foul-mouthed, she finds herself being abused by her spouse, often publicly, and ends up neglecting her children. She, as well as her spouse, are alarmed and shaken when they find out her eldest, Leah, has accepted Islam as her Faith, and when confronted, decides to move out to live with a neighboring Muslim family. Watch what impact this action has on Debbie, the rest of her family, as well as their neighbors.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654557</url></doc>
