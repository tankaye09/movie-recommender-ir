<plot>Arnold Moreno = Pi is a documentary film which highlights the unique life and legacy of Arnold Moreno, a Salvadoran youth who grew up in the Filipino community of Echo Park, Los Angeles. A former gang member turned artist and community activist, Arnold's untimely death in 2000 shattered his close knit community leaving repercussions still felt until today. Combining archival footage and recent interviews, this documentary combines the past and present in order to portray the immense grief felt in the community upon his death, and to highlight the problems in the Los Angeles public heath care, as a microcosm of the situation which millions of uninsured Americans continue to face. Through it all, this film reflects on the legacy of Arnold Moreno, to show that his life and impact truly was, and continues to be, infinite.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?045840</url></doc>
