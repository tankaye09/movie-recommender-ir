<plot>With only 10 days and $700, Jim Lounsbury and Josh Wakely set out for the Mexican border with a digital camera, and the grand intention of making a documentary. Though it turned out to be tougher than they had first anticipated, the richness of the experience led to a few honest discoveries along the way. One year later, the documentary has come to life - a wide eyed look at a country that has a sense of time all it's own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410624</url></doc>
