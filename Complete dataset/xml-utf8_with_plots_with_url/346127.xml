<plot>TURNER STULL(Barlow Jacobs), an uninspired young man, trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, arrives in hurricane-ravaged New Orleans to work as an insurance claims adjuster. Greeted by his UNCLE STULLY(Robert Longstreet) a seasoned claim adjuster, and an ambitious group of adjusters, he is quickly immersed into the routine: move fast, don't get emotionally involved, and make a lot of money. But Turner, not prepared to deal with people who have lost everything, is totally overwhelmed. Turner's lack of experience and uncertainty only makes things worse. In a moment of crisis, Turner agrees to help NIXON(Eddie Rouse), a local man, find his lost dog. In exchange for Turner helping look for the lost dog, Nixon lends a hand with Turner's insurance claim's. Turner and Nixon begin to navigate their way through the storm-ravaged city, a journey that will change Turner's life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346127</url></doc>
