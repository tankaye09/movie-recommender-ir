<plot>There's trouble at the local television station, WARP TV. Myra Stump, "the Darling Hawk of Daytime Talk", has been holding her audience hostage and giving them gifts against their will. Sam and Max try to intervene, but Myra refuses to let them onto the set of her show except as guests. And in order to become guests, the Freelance Police will have to score their fifteen minutes of fame: they need a starring role in a hit TV show, a recording contract, and a juicy tabloid scandal (not necessarily in that order).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?475234</url></doc>
