<plot>Igor has been unable to cope with the mysterious death of his younger brother Mal. In desperation, Igor takes Mal's dead body to a poverty stricken suburban psychic, Mrs Marz with the hope of bringing him back to life. Mrs Marz agrees to help Igor and his deceased brother, in exchange for illicit drugs. When Mal miraculously returns to life after a seance, he appears frightened and paranoid. He speaks of an afterlife where there is no heaven or hell, but a strange state, where we must review the minute details of our earthly existence for the benefit of alien forces. Igor doesn't believe his brother, expecting his ramblings to be hallucinations. Mrs Marz urges Igor to believe his brother, prompting him to hold his hand, so Mal can transmit the experiences he has gone through. Igor holds Mal's hands and becomes unwillingly drawn into the exact after-life that Mal has described.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?256845</url></doc>
