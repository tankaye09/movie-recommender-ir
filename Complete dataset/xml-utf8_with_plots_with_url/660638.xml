<plot>Ed Bathe is an angry man. Over the phone he shouts at someone unseen, someone who has swindled him out of a good deal of money in an apparent fortune telling scam. In his hand, he holds a card with the word "Holder" printed on it. Before abruptly hanging up, he gives a few words of warning: "I'm coming by tomorrow for my money. You better have it" The other man on the line is fortune teller Jerry Beats who owns an incredible future-seeing item he calls the Wordbox. Ask of it your fate, and it will tell you in one word. But when paranoid business man Jonathan Becker shows for his fortune-telling session, he brings his serious money troubles with him, and soon Jerry Beats finds himself in a terrible catch 22 - tell his own future as proof that the box works, or die!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?660638</url></doc>
