<plot>This picture was taken on the promenade deck of one of the great Atlantic liners during a storm and shows a number of passengers clad in rainy day costume, walking the deck. The Captain also appears with a field glass and is making observations. The seas are running very high and make a picture of a very interesting nature. The picture is greatly enhanced by the heavy seas dashing against the sides of the ship, turning the water into foam, and by one of the passengers being taken suddenly ill and going hurriedly to the rail of the ship for obvious reasons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015501</url></doc>
