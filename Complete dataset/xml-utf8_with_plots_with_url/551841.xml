<plot>The Dark Ages is a story set in the Middle Ages and is told from a child's perspective. The protagonist, Elliott, is a little boy who tries to prevent the breakup of his mother and father's kingdom. Elliott tries to use his magic powers to solve the problem; alas, it does not work. He eventually looses all sense of reality when he attempts to physically pull the castle together. This moment dissolves to the present day where Elliott is drawing pictures of himself in the middle ages. He sits at his desk, trying to convince himself that this problem is not his fault.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?551841</url></doc>
