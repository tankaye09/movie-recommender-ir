<plot>The film deals with a story about unusual meeting of two people from Europe. The protagonists are a man and a woman who came to encounter each other. She is a Bulgarian journalist, about 35 old, divorced, without children. He is a 10-year-old boy from Sweden, whose father was her love for a lifetime. This is a film about the present-day wars, affecting our lives even though we haven't a hand in it. It is also a story about the iron curtain - invisible but still existing. Emigrants, wars, hate, anguish, loneliness, fear, drugs, skinheads - is this the word we have created? The East and the West come into inevitable collision. According to the official, who often predetermine our lives, the woman and the boy have no future together as they lack any family resemblance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?067837</url></doc>
