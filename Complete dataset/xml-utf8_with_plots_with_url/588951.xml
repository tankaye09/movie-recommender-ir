<plot>Brian, an artist obsessed with Edvard Munch, is working on a mural. Huddled, half-naked and shivering in his darkened studio, he strives to create an original image. To capture on paint the images that flicker behind his eyes. As his obsession grows, he falls further from reality, driving away his girlfriend and muse, Clare, who is leaving him. Can Bryan win her back with the perfect painting? Can he capture his truth and splash it wide across the walls for all the world to see? And could Clare ever be more to him than a blank canvas? The lines between imagination and reality, Munch and originality, love and lunacy begin to blur. His thoughts and spoken words, his hallucinations and reality bleed into one another until it is impossible to tell which is which. Until the paintings in his head become more vivid than the outside world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?588951</url></doc>
