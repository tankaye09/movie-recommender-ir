<plot>"PAUL CONRAD: Drawing Fire" celebrates the career of this legendary editorial cartoonist. Over his remarkable 50-year career, Conrad has drawn and quartered eleven American presidents (from Harry S. Truman to George W. Bush), and fearlessly tackled every major social and political issue the nation has confronted. Along the way, he's won three Pulitzer Prizes, as well as a long list of journalism's most prestigious awards. The film is narrated by TOM BROKAW, and features the irresistible graphic punch of nearly 200 Conrad cartoons. During his 30 year reign as the voice of the Los Angeles Times, Conrad's work was controversial and often shocking, but always thought provoking. An extraordinary artist and journalist, Conrad epitomizes the fiercely independent voice that has been vanishing from American news media in recent years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?426408</url></doc>
