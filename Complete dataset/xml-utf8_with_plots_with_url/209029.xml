<plot>The local express agent, the father of Tom McGuire, is killed during a robbery. In the chase that follows Tom is wounded and taken by his friend, Sandy Thompson, to the home of Janice Warren  to recover. Janice and Tom soon fall in love, and that brings complications as Sandy is also in love with Janice, and Tom believes that her brother Cliff, is one of the gang members that robbed the express office. Cliff challenges Tom to a shoot-out in the street. Tom accepts, not knowing that his guns have been emptied by the jealous Sandy. The latter, in a change of heart, steps into the duel and shoots Cliff just before he is shot down from ambush by saloon owner Willis, the secret leader of the gang. Willis is captured by Tom and Tom takes Sandy to the doctor. Cliff confesses before dying to his role in the robbery, and Tom and Janice are reconciled.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?209029</url></doc>
