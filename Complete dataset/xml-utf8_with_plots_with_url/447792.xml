<plot>Two very large toads are shown boxing and fighting each other. A very amusing subject. A turtle is seen at the end of the picture shaking his head and evidently greatly excited over the battle he has witnessed between the toads. A very interesting and novel subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?447792</url></doc>
