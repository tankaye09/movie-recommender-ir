<plot>Muses is a tender coming of age story set in small town Chico, California. Angela faces the reality that life is about to change as her high school days draw to a close. Angela also realizes that her best friend Jessica is no longer someone she really knows. Angela is searching for something deeper; something or someone to inspire her and her poetry to go further and she has fixated on Etta, a loner girl who sleeps through their mutual English class. In an attempt to impress Etta, Angela buys a fake ID and sneaks into a bar where instead of finding Etta she meets October. So begins Angela's journey to self-discovery and self-acceptance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382231</url></doc>
