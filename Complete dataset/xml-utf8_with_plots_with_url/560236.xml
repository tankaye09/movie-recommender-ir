<plot>One of the trade paper reviewers carped that this film's major fault was its choppy continuity that has it divided into two separate segments that have no apparent connection. Trade paper reviewers were seldom accused of being overly perceptive, as there was actually a connection to The Wild Bill Hickok television series as this "film" was comprised of two of the television episodes and the public could then line up and pay money at a theatre to see what they could have seen for free at home...if they had a television set, which a large number of the attendees didn't have in 1953. The first segment has Wild Bill (Guy Madison) and deputy Jingles (Andy Devine) "helping" a town boss collect the tax money and then keep him from stealing it, and then they ride on to a ghost town ("The Ghost Town" TV episode) to track down some stolen money. While the TV series rates way low on any scale, it and the features pasted from it are far better than any of the spaghetti westerns Madison found himself in later in his career. But, then, what isn't?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?560236</url></doc>
