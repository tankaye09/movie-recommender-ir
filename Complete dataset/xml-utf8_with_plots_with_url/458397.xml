<plot>An action drama set in Leningrad blocked by Germans during World War II. The spectator is offered only one day with them, but the duration of this day can be compared to a small life. Death, blood, famine and cold are all that surround the people of this besieged city. However, they stand strong against the prevailing evil forces in hand-to-hand combat, and even when faced with death, they never lose their humanity and ability to feel and to love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?458397</url></doc>
