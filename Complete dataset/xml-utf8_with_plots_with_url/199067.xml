<plot>Alfredo, a former revolutionary who is blind, deaf and mute, and his hedonistic wife are visited in their seaside house by another couple, just arriving from New York: a frustrated pianist and her husband, an ex-waiter of dubious character. Relationships of hate, love and sex soon develop between them. They swap wives as a liberation gesture. Besides, the pianist gets a little paranoid, thinking his husband and her friend are trying to eliminate Alfredo and herself, to keep her money.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199067</url></doc>
