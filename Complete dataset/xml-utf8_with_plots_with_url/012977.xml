<plot>Craig is a witty guy who loves his wife very much, yet there is frustration below the surface. Alyssa is a successful poet and university lecturer. In dealing with her husband, she lets her frustrations come through at moments, yet she tries to maintain composure and a sturdy sense of self. Alyssa is the moral center of the piece. She loves her husband, yet devotes more time to her work and building a career. A funny, sad and finally disturbing portrait of a modern romance, "A Marriage" follows Alyssa, a self-governing woman, as she loses her independence at the hands of her loved one and must make a vital decision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?012977</url></doc>
