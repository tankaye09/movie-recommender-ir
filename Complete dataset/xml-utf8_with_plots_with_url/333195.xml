<plot>Lester Horton Technique: The Warm-Up is a unique program designed to prepare dancers for rehearsal and performance. The technique's creator, Lester Horton, was determined to develop a warm-up that did not limit how the body could move, and that was anatomically corrective. As a result, his method has enormous variety, range and complexity. Such noted dancers and choreographers as Alvin Ailey, Bella Lewitzky and Joyce Trisler began their dance training with Horton and used the techniques with their own students. Horton protégée Marjorie B. Perces and Ana Marie Forsythe lead a group of young professional dancers and the viewer through leg swings, metatarsal presses and fortifications in this exclusive Kultur presentation, which preserves this important achievement in dance training for generation to come. For the professional dancer who needs to build strength, agility and flexibility, this program provides important injury-preventing techniques. It's also an excellent way for the non-dancer or athlete to do a non-aerobic workout that helps develop grace and relieves muscle stress.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333195</url></doc>
