<plot>Delhi-based Seema lives a wealthy lifestyle along with her widower father, Professor Khurana, who also runs a business with a partner, Ravi Sharma. When Ravi finds out that Khurana has a uranium formula, he first offers him a large amount of money, but when refused, abducts and holds him in his hideout in Bombay until Seema turns over the formula. Seema is aware that her dad has destroyed the original formula, but has made another one in code, and sewed it in a black coat, and she agrees to bring this coat to Ravi. On the way to Bombay, the coat lands in the possession of two men, Sunil Khosla and Chinappa who are touring Bombay. An enraged Ravi instructs his men and Seema to find the coat at any and all costs and bring it to him or else he will kill Khurana. Seema sets out to find the coat little knowing that that the coat is no longer in Sunil's possession, and she will have to go through a wide assortment of gangsters, petty thieves, hoodlums, and drunks - who may not return the coat to her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284791</url></doc>
