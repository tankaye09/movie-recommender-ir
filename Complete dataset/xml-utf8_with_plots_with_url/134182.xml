<plot>Following in the bloody footsteps of the auto-accident documentaries produced by Highway Safety Films (HSF) of Ohio, with their color footage of mangled accident victims, came a number of independently produced imitators seeking to outdo the HSF product for grue and shock value. Of these, DEATH ON THE HIGHWAY a/k/a/ RIDE TO LIVE, LIVE TO RIDE is probably the most infamous (and sought-after), produced by the "Suicide Club" (Dean Robinson, who also narrates). The main difference between Robinson's film and those of HSF is that, while the HSF offerings consist solely of movie footage of accident scenes, DEATH ON THE HIGHWAY is composed largely of still photos retouched with red ink to underline the gruesomeness. Offered for our inspection: charred corpses scraped from burned cars, a young man cut in half, a young woman with both arms and the top of her head sheared away, and the grand finale: two young children with their arms torn off, pictured first at the accident scene and later side-by-side on a mortuary slab.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?134182</url></doc>
