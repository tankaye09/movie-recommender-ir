<plot>The scene opens with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers. The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room. Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children. He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace. He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts. The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch old Santa Claus by the legs. Santa Claus makes his escape through the chimney and the children are delighted with the presents which he has left. This is a remarkably clear picture, especially pleasing to children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?477088</url></doc>
