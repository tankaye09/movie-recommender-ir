<plot>Once upon a time there was a happy kingdom at the crest of a broad river, at the edge of nearly endless forest. The kingdom was ruled by a fair and just King who had but one daughter, who was the apple of his eye: Princess Angela. She thought of herself as the happiest girl in the whole world because she played all day and danced for her father, the King, at night. But one day all happiness in the kingdom came to an end. Princess Angela was kidnapped by the King's Viceroy. The Viceroy left Angela with his brother, a selfish and mean-hearted woodsman, who lived deep in the heart of the nearly endless forest. Years passed and the kingdom became a very unhappy place, for the King spent all his time looking searching from one end of his vast kingdom to the other looking for his daughter, Princess Angela. And while he was searching for his daughter he left his kingdom in the hands of the Viceroy. The Viceroy, being an evil man, turned the kingdom into an image of himself: miserable and selfish. Deep in the heart of the forest, Angela grew to be an astonishingly lovely young lady. She forgot that she was a Princess, who had danced for her father, the King. Instead she toiled practically night and day for the woodsman. Although the people in the nearby village, grew unhappy because of the Viceroy, Angela's heart remained true. Angela made friends with the forest creatures, who talked to her because they trusted (And everyone knows that forest creatures can talk, but only to those with a true heart). When Angela heard that the King was full of sorrow, she decided to do the only thing she could. She decided to journey to the castle on Christmas Eve to dance before the King to cheer his heart. With the help of her forest creature friends, Angela must reach the castle and dance before the King, her father, before the Viceroy and his evil brother, the woodsman, can stop her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010055</url></doc>
