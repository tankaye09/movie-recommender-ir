<plot>You may have experienced people with dementia. It illicits strong feelings within you from sympathy to fear. But what if you were trapped in the mind of the demented? Accepting Days gives you the opportunity to see what life is like for a man who has Alzheimer's disease. Hank, an elderly man who's lived a full life, is passing his days in a different world than the people around him. He lives his life just like everyone else, but what he sees as reality doesn't necessarily exist anymore. His family works tirelessly at keeping things held together. His wife and daughter are faced with aggression and physical violence. Their lives are overtaken by this disease, and everyone is faced with the challenge of deciding whether to live with it or not. Tension mounts when that decision is compounded by a hidden love. Hank's wife, Alice, has to struggle with the feelings of wanting to love again with a man who is waiting to be loved by her. Tragic fate takes over the decision making for one family member, and the remaining family and friends are left to question whether one man is worth a family's destruction. The weight of his burden forces Hank to contemplate the unthinkable, his right to live.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022017</url></doc>
