<plot>On the eve of the First Gulf War, a frightened young soldier wrote a heartfelt letter to famed songwriter and musician Elvis Costello, whose music reached her in a way no one else's could. She returned home and was astounded to discover that Elvis had been as moved by her words as she was by his; he transformed her 'letter of thanks' into the intense and beautiful song, "I Thought I'd Write To Juliet". Her story and spirit are a testament to the fact that even in our darkest hour we can still find light.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333771</url></doc>
