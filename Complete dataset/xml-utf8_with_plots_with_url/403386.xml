<plot>This dance is a beautiful and rare combination, depicting as it does the breaking of the ocean wave upon a rocky shore, while from the surf arises a beautiful maiden, who unexpectedly delights the audience with an up-to-date serpentine dance. This is surprising and mystifying as well as a most beautiful film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?403386</url></doc>
