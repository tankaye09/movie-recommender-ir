<plot>This movie is a very compelling love story that is hidden underneath the stress of raising a child who has mental instability. In this particular movie I found it amazing how well they portrayed a young boy who had lost almost all functional parts of his brain due to a near drowning accident. His parents fight throughout most the movie about conflicting views of how to raise their son, until one day a plane comes through their roof. The couple inside the plane (Pepper Upper &amp; Mr. Moody) are almost like angels to the family. They make their valentines day, a day the Bridges family will not forget. The stranded couple force the stressed parents to come to copes with each other and their son and help them to see how to enjoy their lives again. In the end the parents fight about whos fault the accident was and then realize it was both of theirs and they are able to overcome this obstacle. Then the young boy Andy asks through his artwork to be taken to a special school for children with his type of disorders. It is a truly inspirational story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269812</url></doc>
