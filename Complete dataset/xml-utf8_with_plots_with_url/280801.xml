<plot>What can we do to help end poverty in India? That is one question that lingered in 19-year-old Mangla Bansal's mind. To find out the causes of the problem and a solution to it, Mangla took a trip to India and Interviewed women and children asking them to tell their stories. When many westerners go to India one usually sees the poverty from the outside; Mangla went inside. Many only hear about India's poverty but, Mangla's goal is to put faces and real life stories to women and children who are living in these situations.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280801</url></doc>
