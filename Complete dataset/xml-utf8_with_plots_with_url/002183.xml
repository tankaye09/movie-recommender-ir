<plot>A plane lands in St. Louis, bringing people home. The camera pans streets and derelict houses, then enters the bedroom of a young girl, ill with pneumonia, and an old woman, lonely and uncared for. Restless youth have no place to go; a tornado leaves disaster in its wake. If you had enough eyes, argues the narrator, you would see these people and want to help them; they're your neighbors. The narration then shift to an appeal for donations to the United Fund, which supports 122 agencies that respond to the needs of neighbors in St. Louis - determining where to help first and where to help most. The narrator asks for donations equal to one hour's pay per month.</plot><plot>A plane lands in St. Louis, bringing people home.
