<plot>It's ten am and the light of a new day shines bright on the faces of the early risers as Rick opens the door and enters to take his place at the far end of the bar. Sometimes a man's strength lies too deep to be found because the layers are piled so high. Rick found himself walking into a bar and never leaving shortly after a work injury took away all he knew. Without warning Rick found himself layering one beer on top of another to take away his pain until one day he found himself living what he thought could never happen to him. Bar Noise reveals the sometimes humorous and sometimes tragic look at the bar and the people who are pulled into its daily life. The bar will never look the same once you've seen it through the eyes of a barfly.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?058923</url></doc>
