<plot>"IF YOU LOVE ME" It's a romantic drama about four couples having problems in their perspective relationships. One couple fights constantly, until one night the "drama" just goes too far. One couple is married and the husband is living a double life. The 3rd couple is made up of the "good man" caring, loving, generous, honest and stable wants to have a future with his girlfriend but she has other plans. The last is a couple keeping their relationship a secret because to tell anyone would tear their lives a part.
