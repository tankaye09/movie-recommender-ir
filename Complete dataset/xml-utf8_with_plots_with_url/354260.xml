<plot>Eddie Green hates his life. He hates his job, he hates his wife, his hates his home, everything. When Eddie reaches the end of his tether and decides to end it all, he has a vision of Pinocchio. Pinocchio tells him that the way to escape his miserable existence is not to kill himself but to cut himself into little pieces and mail himself away limb by limb, replacing what he chops off with wood. It turns out not to be as easy as it sounds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354260</url></doc>
