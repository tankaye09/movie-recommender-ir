<plot>It's the age of the hi-fi and the L.P. Maryann puts a record on the turntable, and a woman who's also the narrator shows Maryann and Cory how to do a striptease. For her, it's exercise, instruction, and dance. Then it's Cory's turn to show what she's learned: "Feel the beat, and take it easy at first," advises the teacher, and soon Cory has the swing of it. After Cory is exhausted, it's Maryann's turn. As the teacher watches approvingly wearing a red bow and not much else, Maryann does well. The three women agree that the money spent on the album was well worth it, and they'll take the music and their talent to swinging parties to show off what they've learned.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?382421</url></doc>
