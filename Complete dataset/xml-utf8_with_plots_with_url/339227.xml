<plot>In 2007 the Nevada State Railroad museum ran the #22 Inyo for the Nevada Railroad History Symposium weekend. Living Steam opens with a summary of Virginia and Truckee Railroad history. Then the Inyo Engineer Lee "Hobo" Hobold fires the Inyo a day ahead to test it. He finds a leak, puts out the fire, and fixes the leak. On the next day, both the Inyo and the #8 are fired up. We see the employees and volunteers at the museum prepare to run these trains for the public. The Inyo and the #8 pull historic cars which are summarized in a second history chapter. Then, after hauling passengers all day, the Inyo is put away. Later, the Inyo is maintained. A chapter is devoted to cleaning the stack and reattaching it. Then, another chapter shows the historic equipment put back on display in the museum. The final chapter discusses the end of the line on May 31, 1950, when the V&amp;T abandoned the railroad.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339227</url></doc>
