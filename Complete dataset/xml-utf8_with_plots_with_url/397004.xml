<plot>A man filled with regret and disappointment, Joe, a short order cook, spent most of his free nights alone on the rooftop of his building. Like a thorn that pierced him with every waking moment, he would numb the pain with an occasional drink that soon led to his isolation from the cold world he knew. A pause button had been pressed down on his life and left him wondering when it would play once more. A young waitress wiped the last table and heaved a sigh of relief. It would be another day of frozen existence, not knowing who she was or why she had even come to this country. Sacrifices would have to be made for her new life in America and her husband would be there to remind her of it with every blow of his hand. Every bruise belittled her and yet she pressed on at the diner. A twelve-year old girl sheds her last tear, picks up her things and moves on to the next shelter. Nina had been abandoned, sought after as a runaway, and hid like a frightened child from the unknown. Where her next steps would take her, she wasn't too sure. Three lost souls are led by fate to each other and their relationships develop a new kind of family. An eagerness to start over seems possible as they plan a one-way ticket out of here. All is possible until their love and hope is tested again...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?397004</url></doc>
