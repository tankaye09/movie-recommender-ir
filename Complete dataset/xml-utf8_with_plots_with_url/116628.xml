<plot>Kyle Varn is suffering from amnesia, caused by his violent arrest. Government Agent Juliette Hamilton shocks him with evidence that he is a ruthless freelance assassin who she suspects has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in the city. Believing Varn - his psychotic personality erased - is her only hope of locating the bomb, Juliette breaks Varn out of prison. As they pinball across London, memories are triggered by clues from Varn's past. Desperate to find the bomb, Varn's flitting recollections lead them through a series of seemingly dead-ends until his grip on his fractured psyche forces them to confront a dark and disturbing secret from their collective past. Can they overcome their personal misgivings and disarm the bomb before Varn's deadly personality re-emerges?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?116628</url></doc>
