<plot>A film made for the "Progetto Legalit√†" Foundation, in memory of Paolo Borsellino and all the victims of the mafia. The film is a voyage through the memories of the family members of mafia victims, who courageously and vividly tell the stories of their dramatic experiences in having lost a husband, a sister, a brother. Some were policemen or judges, others were lawyers, accountants, doctors, or simple citizens, who couldn't escape the hands of a cruel fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268173</url></doc>
