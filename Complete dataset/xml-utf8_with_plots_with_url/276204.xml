<plot>Jesus is getting a little fed up with what he's finding on planet Earth since his last 'official visit'. Jesus discusses the historical accuracy of his words ('This time I'm putting it on video tape', he tells us). The depiction of his form (he was originally black the first time around you know), his favorite coffee shop chain, prayer ('Everyone is asking to win the lottery'), commuting, chewing gum, ('I invented gum', he says) and how riding in a car is far better than riding on a donkey ('Mankind has come a long way since... zero'). But, in the end, Jesus must decide the fate of Earth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276204</url></doc>
