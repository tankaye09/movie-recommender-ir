<plot>Harada is a successful scenario writer, and his best buddy has just announced an intention to propose to Harada's ex-wife. Recovering from the shock, Harada indulges in melancholy, mainly on his failure as a husband and father, and goes to a 'Rakugo' (sit-down comedy) show, where a friendly man in the audience invites him home. Harada is puzzled at the strong resemblance of this man and his wife to his own parents, who were killed nearly 30 years ago when he was twelve.

That they become lovers is no surprise, but she manages to hold an air of mystery. Despite making enthusiastic love, she never allows him to see her breasts, explaining that she has a terrible scar from a burn. Harada becomes increasingly agitated about the unreality of the visits with his parents, and he notices in a mirror that his face is becoming zombie-like. Dark rings under the eyes, a white-ish tone to his skin, and a haggard look. Kei sees it too, and warns him to stop visiting the parents. She warns that they are ghosts and they are feeding off his life force...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?257027</url></doc>
