<plot>A distracted husband's detour leaves him in the middle of nowhere - a place he can't even find on the map. Things get progressively worse for him as his car dies and he manages to lock himself out of the car. Luckily his cell phone still works and his wife's at home. But when she heads out to find him, the connection seems to fade with each approaching mile.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097886</url></doc>
