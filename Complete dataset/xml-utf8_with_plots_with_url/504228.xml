<plot>Raj Matthews has been selected the best actor in the Bollywood Cine Awards. He dedicates this award to his pretty co-star, Preeti Sardesai. Raj has everything going for him. He is rich, famous, handsome, and popular. Preeti thinks a lot about him, and is even considering having an affair with him. Behind all the glitter and the glory lies an embittered Mrs. Matthews - namely Madhurika - who is insecure and jealous of Preeti, and suspects her husband of having an affair with her. She will not tolerate any woman to come between her and Raj - even if it means killing her or both of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?504228</url></doc>
