<plot>The sequel to GUNS ALONG THE BRAVO, SHOWDOWN AT DEVIL'S BUTTE is, like its predecessor, an independently-made Western shot on location in the American Southwest for authenticity. The villainous outlaw "Bloody" Jack Ryker has escaped from prison and headed for the hills with heroic cowboy Texas Clapsaddle as a hostage. Clapsaddle's two compatriots, Stormy Lane and Cimarron Simmons, follow in pursuit, eager to rescue their comrade and put the criminal Ryker back behind bars. SHOWDOWN AT DEVIL'S BUTTE is an old-fashioned, family friendly Western adventure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?494820</url></doc>
