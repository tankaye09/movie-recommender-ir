<plot>A film set in a small Polish village in the '60s that deals with a young girl's awakening sexuality. Mala, about 13, lives with her unmarried mother and has a boyfriend of her own age. The village is sent into a turmoil by the arrival of the clan of Gypsies, who set up camp in the field. Gypsies are ostracized and damned as 'devils' by the conservative villagers. Mala is attracted to the Gypsies. But the locals attack their camp with fire hoses and Gypsies move on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144239</url></doc>
