<plot>A nightclub with mysterious logos... a belly dancer playing with some golden veils... two acrobatic barmen...: a man, who looks very nervous, makes a proposal to a woman who's watching the show with a girlfriend: she will go to bed with him in an hour... The unusual adventure, described through the protagonist's memories, will end up in unexpected way. This short-film is a witty comedy that is focused on love. All characters (two men and two women) are victims of love, but each of them feels love in a different way. The film is a half-serious analysis of love through a non-consequential succession of ironic and paradoxical events (which is obtained by a non-linear editing). But every event is connected with each other by a hidden plot that will be revealed only in the end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?106044</url></doc>
