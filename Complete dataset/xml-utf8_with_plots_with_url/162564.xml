<plot>This is the old story. A Dutchman and an Irishman are disputing on a political question and holding an apparently heated argument over the election. They appear to differ somewhat, and finally indulge in a real up-to-date scrap. While the fight is in progress, if you will imagine just what a Dutchman and an Irishman would say to each other when arguing with their fists, this film will appeal to you all the more as being a winning card. It will take with any audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162564</url></doc>
