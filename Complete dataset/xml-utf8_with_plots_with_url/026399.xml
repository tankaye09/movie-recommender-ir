<plot>Prabhat is a dumb young man who has an alcoholic for a father, and a loving stepmother. He works honestly, gives evidence against his office manager, and gets a promotion, but decides to offer this position to his younger stepbrother. The daughter of the office manager plots revenge, marries his stepbrother, and moves in to Prabhat's house - with a motive so devious that will pit the family against each other, and change their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026399</url></doc>
