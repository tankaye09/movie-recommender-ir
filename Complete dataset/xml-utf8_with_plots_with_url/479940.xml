<plot>John Leslie is the commanding officer of the Scavengers, two teams of space troops whose job is to scavenge spare metals from derelict spacecrafts. John and The Scavengers joined by a female android set out to the abandoned alien spaceship "Cyclops" where both teams have 60 minutes to use their brains and their bodies to salvage as much spare parts from "Cyclops" in a series of obstacle games. Where in the final game, both teams have 7 - 5 minutes to get enough fuel barrels to their shuttle "Falcon" and get across the void of the ship and get back on-board "Falcon" where all Scavengers who fail to get back on-board "Falcon" before time is up, they would get left on-board "Cyclops" at the mercy of the evil aliens on-board.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479940</url></doc>
