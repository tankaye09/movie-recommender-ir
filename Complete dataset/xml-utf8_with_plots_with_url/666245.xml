<plot>Don Baker pumps on the Organ while the Song Spinners sing and the audience is invited to "follow the bouncing ball" and sing-along to the lyrics written on the screen. If the latter did, and most didn't, they joined in on "You've Got Me Where You Want Me", "You Belong to My Heart", "Sentimental Journey", "Sunny Side of the Street" and "Horses Don't Bet on People"...and Audiences Don't Sing Along...except when they shouldn't.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666245</url></doc>
