<plot>After his father, Bhaskar Balwant Mahajan, loses his mental balance, Shrikant and his mother live a poor lifestyle near Sundernagar, which is managed and looked after by a kind-hearted nobleman, Mansinghrao Jagirdar. He re-locates for further studies, meets a young woman, Pooja, who suffers from anxiety neurosis, and both fall in love with each other. He arranges to get her hired as a teacher in the school in his village, and she re-locates to live in their house. Shortly after her arrival, she starts to behave strangely, has hallucinations, often passes out, and at times refuses to recognize Shrikant and claims that she is already married. Shrikant arranges her to be medically treated, and the doctor's prognosis does not look promising. This mystery illness of his sweetheart deepens and gets complicated even more after Pooja uncovers human skeletal remains near their residence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020340</url></doc>
