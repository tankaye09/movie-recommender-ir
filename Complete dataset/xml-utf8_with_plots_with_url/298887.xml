<plot>Michael Rogers, is an inspired American with a passion for the martial arts and a dream to fight in Kumite. His desires for a disciplined way of training take him to Japan. There he trains with Master Yoshima, an instructor for a group of international martial arts students. It's not long before Michael falls in love with a beautiful Japanese girl by the name of Sun Ying Mitusu, nicknamed Butterfly. However, Butterfly's brother, Kasu, disagrees with Michaels' intentions to court his sister, and as always tries to control Butterfly's life. Kasu, is not just Butterfly's brother, but the leading champion in Kumite with the record of 15 years. But nothing, even Kasu, could stop love from coming together. Michael and Butterfly married and Butterfly gives birth to a son named Ben. But Kasu's hatred headed only in one direction, and Butterfly's death through the hands of her possessive and angry brother was unfortunately Kasu' only way. Saddened and depressed by her death, her husband and son returned to the United States. Michael continued with his training, and started the Michael Rogers Karate School. Many years later, Michael received an invitation to enter the Kumite. His decision to participate included Ben's support that would certainly help him through the Kumite.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?298887</url></doc>
