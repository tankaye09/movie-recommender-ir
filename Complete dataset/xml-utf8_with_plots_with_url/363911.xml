<plot>Seven years ago, navy deep-sea pilot JONAS TAYLOR found himself on a top-secret dive in the Mariana Trench, the deepest, most unexplored realm in the ocean. Seven miles down he came face-to-face with the most fearsome predator ever to inhabit the planet - Carcharodon Megalodon- the 70-foot 60,000 pound prehistoric cousin of the great white shark. Rushing his submersible topside, he barely escaped, but his actions cost the lives of the two scientists on-board the vessel, as well as his career, the Navy dismissing his claims as mere "aberrations of the deep." When an opportunity to return to the Mariana Trench presents itself, Jonas takes it, intent on returning topside with a 7-inch white tooth. But man's presence in this unexplored domain releases one of the sharks from its purgatory - a pregnant female - and now the hunt is on!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363911</url></doc>
