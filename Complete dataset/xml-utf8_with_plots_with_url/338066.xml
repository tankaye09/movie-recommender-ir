<plot>A German band is playing in front of a small saloon. The proprietor orders them to move on but the band plays on with more vim. In desperation he mixes some beer and kerosene and invites the band in to have a drink. One of the players fills his brass horn full of beer while the owner is busy serving the others. When they find they have been tricked they adjourn to an alley and enjoy their plunder, much to the disgust of the saloon keeper.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?338066</url></doc>
