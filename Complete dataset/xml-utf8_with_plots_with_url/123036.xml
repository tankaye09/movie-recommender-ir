<plot>This early practice session at Sherpa Studio (Fullerton, CA) was captured by the staff of Flipside Magazine in 1983. It takes a candid look at the band just after they had been featured in the film Suburbia. Also included on this DVD is a self driven interview with the band which showcases their light and jovial nature. It's quite a contrast to the issues they tackled in many of their songs which portray the 80's as a time of despair in the Reagan era. For some this will be an opportunity to revisit where D.I. came from, for others this will be a chance to experience D.I. in its infancy for the first time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?123036</url></doc>
