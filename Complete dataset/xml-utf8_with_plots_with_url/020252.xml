<plot>Rajesh, though orphaned at a very age, comes from a very wealthy and noble family, is very insecure and possessive almost to the point of an obsession. As a child he had loved a girl named Meena, and when she tragically passes away, Rajesh substituted her with a doll. When he found that another young boy had touched the doll, he starts a fight with him, and ends up killing him. Years later, Rajesh has grown up, but still has the doll in his closet drawer, he has fallen in love with a woman named Meena and wants to marry her. He even gives Girdharilal, Meena's dad, some money so that he can get his eldest daughter, Parvati, married to Prem, the son of money-lender, Mayadas. He introduces Meena to his close and best friend, Dr. Shekhar, and soon gets formally engaged to Meena. Thereafter, Rajesh and Meena have an automobile accident, in which Rajesh becomes paralyzed and must be confined in a wheelchair. It is then that Rajesh finds out that Shekhar and Meena are having an affair, and the old murderous and possessive hatred, that he had managed to conceal, surfaces again - and this time it will be Shekhar's turn.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020252</url></doc>
