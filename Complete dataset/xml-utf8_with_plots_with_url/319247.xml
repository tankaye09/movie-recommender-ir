<plot>Biography of Brazilian actress Odete Lara, a sex symbol in theater, television, music, and cinema. The film begins in the fifties, when Odete was 21. The country was at the start of a rapid process of industrialization and social change. The daughter of Italian immigrants born in São Paulo, she had to overcome traumas, among these, the suicide of her parents. She went on to be in Brazil's first-ever fashion parade/show. She entranced the founder of the Museum of Art (MASP) where the fashion parade was being held, and her career was hence launched. Lara then became an icon in TV advertising. This 'blonde goddess', however, left her career at its peak to devote herself to a life of meditation and religious devotion, in the mountains of Rio de Janeiro.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?319247</url></doc>
