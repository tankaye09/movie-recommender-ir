<plot>Well-meaning, easy-going promoter Jasper Jim Bandy (Thurston Hall), who is constantly talking himself into james, and Cornelia Catheride (Regina Wallace), poor cousin of the Boston Catheridges, have been carrying on a correspondence romance, each thinking the other is fabulously wealthy. Bandy's nephew Bob Randall (Jack Leonard, the singer and not the comedian), singing rodeo star, is engaged to Jean Darrow (Mary Dugan), daughter of Senator Darrow (Sam Flint), who has decided to sell his palatial ranch but has refused an offer from Martin (Tristram Coffin), because he knows Martin intends to turn the ranch into a gambling casino. The Hoosier Hotshots (Paul Trietsch, Ken Trietsch, Gil Taylor and Charles Ward as Hezzie, Ken, Gil and Gabe), who have been working in Bandy's medicine show, tell Martin that Bandy needs a ranch to impress Cornelia when she comes to visit him. Martin gives Bandy the money to buy the ranch and everything is set for Cornelia's visit. When Martin and his men (Lynn Craft---an actor and not an actress as some source thinks---Rube Schaeffer, Earl Brown and George Dockstader) move in to take over the ranch for the opening of a casino, Bandy confesses to Cornelia he is a fraud and she also admits her deceit. Jean, thinking Bob is involved with Martin, breaks their engagement. The Sheriff (George Lloyd) raids the casino on opening night, and just as he is about to haul off the gamblers and their equipment, "Chief Iron Stomach" (Jock Mahoney uncredited), a man to whom Bandy once sold his "secret Indian" formula, arrives with a wad of money to give Bandy his share.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?525653</url></doc>
