<plot>My name is Kelvin is the story of a group of young boys who live in an orphanage beside Lake Victoria in Western Kenya, and who have created an extraordinary Aids-awareness show, with songs based on their own lives as HIV orphans and former street children. Through the process of writing and performing to other children in local schools and villages, the boys have found a voice and discovered a sense of purpose - from being victims of the epidemic, they have become agents of change, and symbols of hope for the future.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384552</url></doc>
