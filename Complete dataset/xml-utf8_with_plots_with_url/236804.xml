<plot>A mock documentary about an American filmmaker who wants to produce a film about the real-life story of Merhan "Alfred" Nasseri, a refugee from Iran who, through a series of bureaucratic snafus and the theft of his identification papers, has been stranded in Charles de Gaulle airport since 1988. Nasseri is reluctant to take part, but the pushy director will stop at nothing to see his vision come to life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236804</url></doc>
