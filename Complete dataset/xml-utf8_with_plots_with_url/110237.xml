<plot>In animation, a fellow named Keith tells us about his addiction to high-priced coffee at Ishmael's (not its real name). Trying to quit, he'll go a few days without, but eventually find himself back in line. He walks us through his most recent visit: who else is there, the incompetent clerk with bovine eyes, the tattooed barista, and the mangled order that keeps him up all night. Never again, he swears.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?110237</url></doc>
