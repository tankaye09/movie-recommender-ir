<plot>A photographer Dilip (Kamal Haasan) gets involved with a group of three supermodels, all of who are sent abroad for an international tour by business magnate Oberoi (Shyamsunder). Other models similarly sent abroad seem to show up dead under strange circumstances, and when the cycle repeats with these three, Dilip becomes the prime suspect. Somewhat scratchy follow-up to the racier "Sivappu Rojakkal" from the same director, generally watchable. Remarkably poor performances all-round.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608010</url></doc>
