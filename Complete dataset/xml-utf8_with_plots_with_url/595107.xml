<plot>"A practical illustration of the value of this modern invention. Posted up on the wall is the startling sign, DON'T TRAVEL. USE TELEPHONE. YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT. Man comes in, rings up, takes telephone, talks, then waits a moment; opens little door at the bottom of the receiver, and takes out a glass of beer! Blows off the foam, takes a deep draught, and telephones for a cigar. Waits a moment; gets impatient and calls again, when out comes a blast of flour, plastering his face and clothes so that he looks like a miller. Sure to create barrels of fun. The man's face is a study. From satisfied contentment over his beer to utter disgust about the flour, the contrast and changes are most accurately shown."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?595107</url></doc>
