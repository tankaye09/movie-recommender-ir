<plot>This is a story about a sixteen year old teenager who finds himself being more and more detached from everything. Lonely, depressed and isolated, all he wants is to feel accepted and normal again, so he creates a new world, a land of imagination! He makes a friend there called The Creature - a very colourful character. The Creature, talking in rhyme tells the boy (Timothy) all kinds of thrilling, wacky, poetic stories. So when Timothy gets a chance to write a poem for his school competition, he jumps at the chance, knowing he can use The Creature to help him. However The Creature has other plans. He wants to be set free, and sets out at making it happen by banning Timothy from his imagination. Timothy struggles to cope with losing his escape. After letting Timothy suffer for a while The Creature makes everything around Timothy turn to color. Timothy feels happy and normal, however it's at this point Timothy suddenly strikes a chilling resemblance to a colourful looking character. The Creature finally breaks free.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?260687</url></doc>
