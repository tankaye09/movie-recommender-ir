<plot>After serving seven years for a murder he did not commit, Tony Pelassier, is determined to clear his name, but he finds that going back seven years in an attempt to piece together threads of information is not an easy task. A Scotland Yard detective tries to persuade him to forget the past but Tony and his fianc√©e, Marie, go ahead with the investigation. Tony had been convicted of the murder of a girl who was the cashier in the garage where he worked, and evidence at the trial showed her to be an accomplished blackmailer. Tony became involved by repairing a bracelet for her and taking it to her home where he was apparently the last to see her alive. Tony and Marie succeed in tracking down Carole Carlton, a model who had been a close friend of the murdered girl. After many violet incidents, such as Tony being beaten up by three thugs, Tony and Marie lead the police to the real killer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516292</url></doc>
