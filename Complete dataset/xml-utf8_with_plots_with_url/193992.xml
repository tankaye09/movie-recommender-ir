<plot>Fighting For Our Future is an intimate and comprehensive journey into the lives of young women courageously battling breast cancer. Often told they are too young for the disease, women in their 20's and 30's have long been ignored by medical research communities and are most often misdiagnosed, even though 10,000 of them are diagnosed every year in the United States and they face a more aggressive breast cancer. Here you'll meet Tracy, a 33-year-old mother who worries she won't survive to dance at her son's wedding; Kelly, a 24-year-old diagnosed days after her second wedding anniversary; and Roberta, a 27-year-old who finds the courage to date even after losing a breast. Featuring the women of the Young Survival Coalition and interviews with medical experts such as Dr. Susan Love, Fighting For Our Future chronicles the inspiring stories of women who are determined to make changes within the medical community, and ultimately save lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?193992</url></doc>
