<plot>The world is finally coming to an end and humanity is waiting for the talking poodles on Fox to tell 'em what to do about the inconvenient rains of blood and fire. They're oblivious that everything they've believed to be right is wrong and you know what? That's exactly what Evelyn wants. "Cult of Eden" is a dark story of a twisted young woman named Evelyn who manipulates Adam and their cult of faithful followers into making the ultimate sacrifice for the promise of salvation. No one knows who to trust or what to believe as Evelyn's plans unfold and she sadistically savors the look in their eyes at the moment they realize, "Game's over.. and I lost."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?121011</url></doc>
