<plot>A trick cyclist of international reputation is seen performing at the Crystal Palace, London. The tricks shown are the most difficult ever conceived, and including the almost impossible feat of jumping up a steep flight of steps and down again without dismounting from the wheel. On the second trip upstairs the daring cyclist jumps two steps at a time and then takes a flying leap from the top of the stairs right down to the ground, a distance of twenty-five feet. The film is full of action and furnishes lots of excitement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?465316</url></doc>
