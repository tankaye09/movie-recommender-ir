<plot>Released from prison after a 30-year stretch for a brutal murder, Dennis isn't your typical middle-aged ex-con. He may be a free man, but he's being watched by someone even more dangerous than himself. London is a different city from the place Dennis left behind. The people, the places - everything has changed. Even his home is not his own any more. But some things remain the same: the girls working the streets at the seedy heart of the capital. Starved of female company for three decades, can Dennis be trusted - or will the violent killer who lurks within him reappear during his next encounter? What Dennis doesn't know is that a menacing stranger with a score to settle is following him. Exhausted and twisted with grief, Davey is convinced there is only one way to finally find the peace he so desperately craves: by tracking down the man responsible for the violent death of his sweetheart. While Davey plots his revenge, Dennis plans a meeting with Vicki: a young prostitute struggling to survive in London's cold and sleazy sex industry. Will Vicki become Dennis' latest victim? Or will Dennis become Davey's first?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?637473</url></doc>
