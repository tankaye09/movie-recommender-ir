<plot>Claude Laporte has just died. In fact, he took his own life because, being very ill, he couldn't put up with the suffering it entailed any more. He leaves three children behind him and a great number of notes relative to a manuscript meant to be sent to a publisher. One of his daughters takes possession of these notes and finds out who her father was: someone uncompromising who had been an activist when he was young, later becoming the owner of a country café and a writer in his spare time. A true human being who left a deep mark in the memory of the many people he mixed with every day of his life..</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?322326</url></doc>
