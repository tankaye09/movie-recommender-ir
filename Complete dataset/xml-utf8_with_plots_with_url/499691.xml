<plot>Size It Up combines heart-pounding action with high-tech wizardry to tell the story of the U.S. Military's most amazing mechanical marvels. Each episode focuses on a specific theme such as submarines or missiles and you'll explore them in three different sizes - from the smallest to the largest. You'll discover their similarities, differences, and the unique tasks each size allows our armed forces to accomplish.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499691</url></doc>
