Born in a poor country with a condition known as temporal lobe epilepsy (T.L.E) (see PBS NOVA _Secrets of the Mind_ for details on T.L.E.) and parents who did not understand her she went on to gain their love, conquer T.L.E., and progress to a living saint, the embodyment of love, a Bohdisattva.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?464745</url></doc>
