<plot>What do two marriages on the verge of disaster; one loyal bodyguard; one private investigator with an outstanding gambling debt and a fellow not so affectionately known as "The Butcher", have in common? Once upon a time nothing. Now everything. A terminally ill socialite, "Margaret" suspects that her gold-digging husband "Robert" is having an affair. "Michael" is a private investigator with a big gambling problem and an even bigger debt to the nefarious "Butcher". Hired by "Aaron" to investigate a possible affair his wife Claudia might be having, Michael devises a way to pay off his gambling debt, and make some extra money on the side. On a whim of a last ditched epiphany, and motivated by self preservation, Michael makes a spur of the moment decision that prompts all parties involved to make choices that they never would have contemplated otherwise. With so much to gain, and even more to lose, it's doubtful that anyone will come out on top. Glimpses into the lives of seemingly unrelated characters reveal the complexities of decisions made and consequences suffered. "Attention SPAN" takes us on a journey into betrayal, deceit, lust, gambling, sex and secrets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?050527</url></doc>
