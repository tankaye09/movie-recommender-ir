<plot>Two men claiming to be police detectives barge into sleeping Steve Drake's apartment and interrogate him, mainly because his name is Mr. X. They want to know about his sexual thoughts concerning his landlady, his girlfriend, and everyone he knows. He is reluctant to answer their questions, and isn't even sure if they are real, or if this is all part of a paranoid wet dream.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151519</url></doc>
