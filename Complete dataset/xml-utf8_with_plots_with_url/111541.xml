When Macbeth and war friend Banquo see a prophecy taken from three witches, the three witches predict that Macbeth will go on from Thane of Glamis, to Thane of Cawdor and then the prestigious King; Banquo is hailed as the father of kings to come. When Macbeth is crowned Thane of Cawdor, Macbeth's wife, Lady Macbeth then pressures Macbeth into killing King Duncan so therefore the next person in line to become king is...Macbeth.
