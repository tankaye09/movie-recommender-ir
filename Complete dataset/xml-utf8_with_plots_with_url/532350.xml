A driver who drives a cab by day, then drinks at night, listens to his singer girlfriend, Sylive, and then goes into a drunken stupor - and wakes up with a hangover. One day, while assisting another taxi driver, Mangal comes to the assistance of a damsel in distress, who is being molested by two thugs. Mangal gallants rescues her, and attempts to take her to her destination, to no avail, as the person she is looking for has moved. The next day, Mangal and the young woman, Mala, again attempt to seek Ratanlal, a music director, but the entire day is spent in vain. Mala lives in Mangal's tiny apartment and both become attracted to each other. When Mala finds out about Sylvie, she leaves him.
