<plot>Take a roller-coaster of a journey into the sadistic personality of Jessica, a strict vegan who always gets her way. When she discovers her boyfriend has been having an affair with meat, she has only one thing on her mind - revenge. But what opportunities does this offer a dead Cannibal, freshly killed the day before. Watch, as the most unlikely of characters team up for what becomes a horrifyingly comical series of events as we discover the ramifications of Jessica's actions. Slick, stylish and packed with more surprises than a chocolate selection box, this short movie will have you laughing, and crying for more.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547305</url></doc>
