<plot>Broken love. Phony families. Distorted dreams. For the twenty-something friends of Closer Than The Boy Next Door, the nineties are anything but slack. A hip and honest slice of life, Closer Than The Boy Next Door explores today's big issues. You know, sex, careers, The X-Files. Justin is lost and lonely. During the day he hauls boxes at a warehouse to pay the rent. At night he scribbles in his notebook and wonders whether his creative writing degree will ever lead to something more. Justin's sister Janeane is an aspiring chef whose own self esteem issues account for her undying commitment to a creepy boyfriend and her inability to take that next career step. Along with their two best friends, Alex a suave, sexually exuberant DJ and Max a spunky, sarcastic journalist-in-training, Justin and Janeane search for meaning and satisfaction in their unstable lives. Soon their frustration draws these siblings together, closer than ever and they eventually find some answers in very strange and very shocking places.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?109005</url></doc>
