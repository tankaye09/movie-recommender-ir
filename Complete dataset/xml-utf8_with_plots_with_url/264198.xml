<plot>This is a story not only of Wilmington, but also of NC (Hollywood East). NC has beautiful scenery, a large crew and cast production base, and a large movie studio (Screen Gems). Recently, the number of productions is in decline. Movie production is moving away from Wilmington and NC because other states and countries have financial incentives that NC doesn't have. This is the story of the need to keep a jewel of the NC culture: filmmaking.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264198</url></doc>
