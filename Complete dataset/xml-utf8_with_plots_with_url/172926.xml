<plot>Lynn lives with her husband Arturo on an island off the coast of Spain. Everything looks normal except that Arturo has a disease that makes him sexually impotent. Frustrated, Lyn has an affair with a local youth, but she soon discovers that she is pregnant. She needs to get rid of the baby very quickly so that Arturo doesn't know she's cheating on him, but the process of abortion being illegal, she doesn't know where to turn to. There is this old local woman who aborts young women, but the risk taken on life is big as hygiene conditions are very low, and there have been recent accidents. There is also this strange doctor, friend with Arturo, but he'll agree to do the operation only if Lynn has sex with him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?172926</url></doc>
