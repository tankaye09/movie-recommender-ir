<plot>Jake Duncan, a good-looking successful record producer, in an industry and city where meeting girls is easier then figuring out which wax to put on his car (vision of his car, wax, detail shop &amp; two girls are shown in hilarious way); feels the pressure of marriage as he's nearly approaching his 30th birthday. A happy go lucky guy who has too many girls and never the right one. That's Jake, always smiling, joking and telling his married friends stories as they live vicariously through him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?651747</url></doc>
