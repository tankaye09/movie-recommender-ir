<plot>After Jane has graduated from college, she knows she wants to travel the world, but instead is stuck in upstate New York living with her success and stability-obsessed parents who have no respect for her privacy and with her older sister who for some reason won't get out of her pajamas. Luckily, Jane has her best friend Dan to fall back on with the thoughtful e-mails they've been exchanging for years. But Dan just got a sexy dancer girlfriend and he tells Jane he doesn't have time for her anymore. Outraged, Jane argues that no one simply has time; people make time for what they care about. With this realization, Jane writes a self-help book telling people how to make time for what's important in life. To everyone's surprise, Jane's book becomes wildly successful. Now Jane has the confidence to convince Dan to make time for her, but things aren't so easy when Jane fails to make time for the people who care for her the most.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235348</url></doc>
