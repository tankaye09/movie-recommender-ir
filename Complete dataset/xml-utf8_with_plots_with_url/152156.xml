<plot>Kenneth is readying himself to go on stage. The theater manager enters his dressing room in order to comfort his lead actor, who reveals his fears about a man named Edmond, who wishes to usurp his place. As Kenneth takes his final bows, the theater transforms into a broken-down stage and the cheering audience is replaced by Kenneth's son, Edmond, and a doctor. Edmond tells his father that he has become insane. The doctor slyly coaxes Kenneth out of the theater. As Edmond attempts to leave, he is stopped by the theater manager. The location reverts back to Kenneth's fantasy theater and the audience reappears, dragging Edmond onto the stage. On stage, Edmond dramatically ages and collapses, while the audience wildly applauds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152156</url></doc>
