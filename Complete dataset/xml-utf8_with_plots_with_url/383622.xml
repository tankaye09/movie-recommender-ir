<plot>Through the use of black and white photographic stills and voice-over narration, an adult gay man looks back on his childhood and coming out in an Oregon town. Forced out of the closet by his parents at age 16, he is confronted by the intolerance and paranoia of those he loves the most. His parents take him to a psychologist, show him a video involving male prison rape and abuse, and, in a last desperate attempt to save their son, drop him off in the study of the local Baptist preacher. A few years later, his attempts to reconcile the position of the church, his parents, and his own conscience, lead him to ask "am I really gay?" He searches for potential causes of gayness. A true autobiographical story of a young man growing up in the mill town of Springfield, Oregon in the 1970's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383622</url></doc>
