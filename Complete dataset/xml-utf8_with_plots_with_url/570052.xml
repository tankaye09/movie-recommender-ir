<plot>The tiny village of Finn Slough clings to the bank of the Fraser River in the City of Richmond, British Columbia, part of greater Vancouver. Settled over a hundred years ago by Finnish fishermen and their families, only a few fishermen remain, but somehow, Finn Slough has survived, its residents determined to protect and preserve their unique lifestyle of homes on stilts, in the midst of nature in the tidal area close to the mouth of the Fraser River, once a prime fishing ground for salmon. Finn Slough's residents are now a colorful collection of eccentrics and artists, each with a story to tell of struggle to maintain a dream in the face of ever-threatening urban development. Without title to the land on which their homes sit, the river people of Finn Slough find themselves at the mercy of the whimsical currents of competing jurisdictions and economic interests.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?570052</url></doc>
