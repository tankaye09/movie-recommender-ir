<plot>Petals - Journey into Self Discovery that both questions, and then examines, the many unspoken myths about the appearance and nature of women's sexual center. The essence of a woman's sexuality - her vulva - has been a taboo subject for cultures locked into fears of our basic physical nature. These deep-seated beliefs directly affect female sexual self-esteem. The movie records the reactions of sex educators, women's health professionals, art critics, female activists, as well as the man/woman-in-the-street as they confront the physical mystery of womanhood. Unforgettable women, some who become guides and teachers in the quest, join in confronting both the current fears and timeless beauty found in a woman's most basic sexual nature. These stories uncovered both personal trauma and unfamiliar pleasures as forbidden cultural attitudes were unblocked by an honest display of women's genitalia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?430249</url></doc>
