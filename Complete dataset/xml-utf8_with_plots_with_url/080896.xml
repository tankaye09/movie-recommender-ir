<plot>The Caretaker, an infirm elderly man, lies in his hospital bed whilst an evil robot wreaks mayhem outside in the city. His only companion is a superhero doll that he has owned since he was a boy. To the old man's surprise a collection of miniature theatre stages appear on the floor on which we see moments from his past, and that reveal a disturbing link between The Caretaker, his superhero doll and the evil robot outside.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080896</url></doc>
