<plot>Nick is a still photographer, feeling trapped in a life that includes a new baby and a wife he believes is too demanding and not understanding enough. His favorite form of relaxation has become flirting with women in online chat rooms - an activity he conceals from Marie. One night, after an argument with her, he manages to justify leaving the house after Marie has gone to bed to meet a particularly exotic Asian beauty named Jasmine. He wines and dines and dances with her and takes her back to his photography studio where her poses get more and more sexual in nature. Ultimately he beds her - or so it seems. Suddenly he finds himself back at the computer having gone nowhere in reality but a little too far in his head. He makes his way to the bedroom where Marie lies awake waiting for him. It's then that he realizes that he still loves his wife and has all along.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?489897</url></doc>
