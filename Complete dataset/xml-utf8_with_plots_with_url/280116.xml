<plot>"Joy to the World ang Prosesyon" (Foot Parade is a Joy to the World), a canvass of thirteen short stories weaved together, is an unlikely unconscious contemplation of Filipinos on Man's stages of existence - birth, life, death, and resurrection. Because most Filipinos are strongly bounded by Cathocism, they usually re-enact these stages in lieu to the life of Jesus Christ in a passion play and a procession or foot parade called the "Via Crucis" during the Holy Week. "Joy to the World ang Prosesyon" is a film of muffled births, small lives, unknown deaths, and unrecognized resurrections of Man.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280116</url></doc>
