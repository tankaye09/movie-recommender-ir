<plot>A group of 4 environmental activists (a river guide, a surgeon, his young assistant, and a rather eccentric Vietnam veteran) fight the over-development of the 1970's American West. Together, though not always working as a tightly-knit team, they form the titular group dedicated to the destruction of what they see as the system that pollutes and destroys their environs. As their attacks on deserted bulldozers and trains continue, the law closes in.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?577259</url></doc>
