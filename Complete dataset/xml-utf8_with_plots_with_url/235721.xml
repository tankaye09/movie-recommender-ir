<plot>Created in the tradition of old-Hollywood detective movies (B/W, voice over, chain-smoking sleuth), "Henryville" is a film noir spoof in which one actor plays every character in the film. Henry Mitchell is a sharply-dressed man searching for his long-lost twin brother in the small, incestuous town of Henryville. The only problem is, everybody looks the same. Detective Mitchell encounters a number of strange characters on his journey, including the local sheriff-- who takes an instant dislike to our hero. When Detective Mitchell gets implicated in a crime he did not commit, it is up to him and his keen sense of deduction to solve the mystery and capture the seductive, long-legged criminal, "Infinity".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?235721</url></doc>
