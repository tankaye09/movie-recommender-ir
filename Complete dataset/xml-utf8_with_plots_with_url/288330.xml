<plot>Kuldeep Khanna leads a comfortable lifestyle in Britain along with his wife, mom, a son, Sunny; and several other relatives. One day his friend from India, Dr. Verma, asks him to look after his niece, Mahek, for about a month, while he must attend a conference in the U.S.A., to which Kuldeep agrees to. Mahek moves into the Khanna household and notices that the family is dysfunctional. She begins to reform the youngest one, Sweety, and succeeds considerably. Then she teaches Kuldeep's wife and sister-in-laws how to respect her elderly mother-in-law, and follow the Hindu traditions, especially pertaining to religion and Karva Chauth. Mahek then helps Jash Khanna overcome his alcoholism and seek peace with himself after losing his wife, Christine, and son, Tobey, in an accident. It is then Mahek finds out that Sunny is in love with her and wants to marry her. She flatly turns him down, telling him that there is someone else in her life. This upsets Sunny, and does not go unnoticed by his grandma, who asks Mahek what the reason is. Mahek speaks in confidence with grandma, and shortly thereafter grandma suddenly dies. Watch as events unfold with Mahek getting instantly unpopular with the Khannas and the real reason why Mahek refused to marry Sunny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?288330</url></doc>
