<plot>Luna (16) lives with her mother and 6-year-old brother, Bas, in a dreary housing estate on the polder. When Luna stands up for herself against teen gang member, Laura, she becomes the victim of the gang's persecution. The gang leaders exploit the situation and she is forced to give in to their demands. Feeling unloved and abandoned, Luna finds the strength to survive and discovers love in a surprising place. A low-key 'teen drama' set in the sad and dreary, real-life setting of the Dutch polder. The main themes are 'survival' and the 'redemption' available in the acts of giving and accepting love. Even in the toughest circumstances, as long as there is love, there is hope. In spite of everything she goes through, Luna has hope; this is what sets her apart from her contemporaries and gives her the strength to survive. She sees her 'ideal image of love' in Jordie's declaration and subsequent sacrifice, and thanks to that revelation, is ultimately able to recognize the love that has always been there - a mother's love. By accepting that love, her hopes are fulfilled, her 'rite of passage' completed, and she is redeemed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418988</url></doc>
