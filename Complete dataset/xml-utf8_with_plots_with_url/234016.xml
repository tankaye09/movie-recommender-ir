<plot>Neelam is an independent young woman, who is skilled with self-defense, and lives with her guardian, who is also the trustee of Lord Krishna Temple. Although her guardian, with his secretary Julie's help has put forward a number of proposals from suitable young men, Neelam is attracted to a young man named Heeralal P. Srivastav, who runs his own business. Little does Neelam know that Heeralal is not who he claims to be, but is in fact, a burglar named Heera who is after the crown of Lord Krishna, and is just feigning romance with Neelam so that he can get close to her and find out how to steal the crown, give it to his boss, Pratap Singh, who in turn, will sell it to Sheikh Bin Sheikh. The only problem facing Heera is his arch-rival, Moti, who will never let Heera steal the crown. The two must face each other, before they attempt to steal the crown. Watch as events unfold and who, in fact, will manage to steal the crown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?234016</url></doc>
