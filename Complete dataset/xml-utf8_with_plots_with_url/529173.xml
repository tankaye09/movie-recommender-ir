<plot>TAKE IT FROM ME is the story of four women struggling against great odds to raise themselves and their families out of poverty in New York City. It is also an in-depth look at the human impact of the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act and its five-year limit on public assistance. Has welfare reform been successful? Are former public assistance recipients better off once they leave welfare? Shot over a two year period, TAKE IT FROM ME lets these women speak for themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529173</url></doc>
