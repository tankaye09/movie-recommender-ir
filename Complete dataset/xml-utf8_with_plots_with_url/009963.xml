<plot>A very fine picture of a comical Dutchman shaving himself, or, rather, trying to shave himself. The razor is dull and the beard is tough. After many cuts and a great exhibition of facial contortion, the beard and lather are finally removed. A most pleasing subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?009963</url></doc>
