<plot>Ajit Pal is a wealthy U.K. based businessman of East Indian origin. He has a son, Rajeshwar, who lives with Ajit's friend in India. Rajeshwar is prone to all the bad habits possible, but manages to keep away from the clutches of the police. Then one day he sees a beautiful young woman (Madhu) jogging, and decides to have her for himself at any cost. He starts stalking her, and even plants a wireless camera in her bedroom so as to spy on her. One day while following her, he accosts and confronts her and tells her of his love for her, but she rejects him and asks him to leave her alone. He refuses to listen, and tries to force himself upon her but she is saved with the timely arrival of her Police Inspector boyfriend, Vijay. Rajeshwar is arrested and held in prison, but is soon released when a high-priced lawyer is hired by Ajit. Vijay and Madhu hope that it is the last they have seen of Rajeshwar, and return to their romance. But Rajeshwar has not forgotten Madhu, nor of his humiliation at the hands of Vijay. He manages to follow Madhu, confronts her, and has his way with her, and leaves her for dead to carry on with his irresponsible lifestyle. When Vijay finds out that his sweetheart is dead, he is beyond himself and goes on the rampage, looking for Rajeshwar. Before Vijay could even trace him, Rajeshwar finds out that his friends, who had aided him against Madhu, are dying one by one. One is hit by a truck, the other is electrocuted in his bathtub, and a third falls from a cliff. What or who is killing these men, and is Rajeshwar going to be the next victim. Watch as event unfold, pitting Rajeshwar against a force that he, nor his father, can do anything about.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061818</url></doc>
