<plot>Professor Joymohan stays alone in Kolkata. He is a heart patient and when he gets a severe heart attack on his birthday he realizes he needs to spend as much time with his family in Mumbai as possible. He then goes to Mumbai to his son Indra, daughter in law Rita and grand daughter Gargi. While Indra and Gargi are delighted, Rita is not so happy about his arrival. She makes her displeasure more vocal. Joymohan starts going for morning walks to the nearby park in the mornings. During one such morning walk he meets his old student Neelima and her daughter Anjali who wants to do a doctorate in the US.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?377580</url></doc>
