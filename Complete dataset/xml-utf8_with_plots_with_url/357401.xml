<plot>Travis, Nick and Cody have been friends almost all their lives, growing up on the Swinomish Reservation in Washington State. When they find themselves in trouble with drugs and alcohol, the teens are offered an opportunity to participate in Native Lens, Longhouse Media's filmmaking program. Figuring it's better than spending afternoons in drug court, they dream about making a film with car crashes and rap music. But they are asked to make a documentary about the impact of two oil refineries on their tribal community instead. In this coming of age story the boys discover themselves, their community and the threat their people face.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357401</url></doc>
