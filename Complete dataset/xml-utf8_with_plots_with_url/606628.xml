<plot>An insight to Don Aronow - King of Powerboats. Don Aronow born in 1927 in Brooklyn New York, left New Jersey in 1961 to relocate in Miami. From being a huge success in the construction industry, he went on the being a legend as a powerboat designer and racer. Of the World's most recognized racing boat companies, Don Aronow established five; Donzi, Formula, Magnum, Cigarette and US Racing Team. As the US and World Powerboat Champion several times over, his friends, clients, business partners, enemies and competitors were many. Designing and manufacturing powerboats for Presidents, Princes and the privileged, Aronow gained popularity with women and indeed their husbands. As businessman, Aronow applied a no questions asked policy. If the money was there, a boat would be supplied, "I don't care who you are but I will give you the boat if you have enough cash to pay", was a term used by Aronow. Allegedly Aronow, did business on both sides of the law. During the 70's and 80's, with plenty of friends and foes he became an icon, that men idolized. His fast life led to a speedy death, this documentary examines Don's life, his encounters from his early days, to his tragic murder in 1987 in the middle of his reign.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?606628</url></doc>
