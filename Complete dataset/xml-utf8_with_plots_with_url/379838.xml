<plot>Since he was a small boy, Mr. Malakai's overly sensitive ears have forced him to wear earmuffs to muffle the sounds around him. In a noisy world such as ours, you could imagine that this was no easy task. He even had to give up such luxuries as eating toast, brushing his teeth, and even clapping. So it won't be too hard to imagine Mr. Malikai's dismay when an enormous Aeroplane refuses to leave him alone. Shot on Super Super 8, this is the third in a series of absurdist tales by Drew Blatman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379838</url></doc>
