<plot>Ah-Tang and Ah-Yan, both in their early seventies, are flying to New Zealand to visit Ah-Tang's son Mun-Tsai, who has even paid the fare for Ah-Yan to keep his father company. Despite this. Ah-Tang never stops complaining. He has hardly moved from the house since his wife died, and even now feels he has been dragged into this against his will. When they arrive at Wellington Airport, the son is not there. They call his home. No answer. Ah-Yan asks Ah-Tang if he has checked his answer phone. He has not. Dialing into it, and retrieving the messages, they discover that Mun-Tsai had arranged for them to change their tickets and arrive several days later as he was going to be out of town on an business trip. Short of money, and at Ah-Yan's insistence, they decide that, rather than wait near the airport for a few days, they'll make their own way to Mun-Tsai's home. Through their journey, complicated by the fact that neither of them speaks very much English, they encounter a variety of characters and environments, and they discover that - when forced into action - they are not as helpless and lost in the world as they had previously thought.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225785</url></doc>
