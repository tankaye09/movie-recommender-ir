<plot>The internationally popular Irish music "The Chieftains" group plays a variety of traditional instruments, talks, and sings. After fifteen years together they are largely responsible for the revival of the Irish folk music tradition. Graphics and film illustrate some of their songs. The instruments: Irish harp, tin whistle, uilleann pipes, flute, fiddles, bones and bodhran drum. Performance pieces include the 17th century "Morgan McGann", the "Train Song", "Music from Brittany." "The Battle of Aughrim" (illustrated with paintings of the battle especially commissioned for this broadcast), "Women of Ireland" (theme of film "Barry Lyndon"), "Kerry Slides" (dance). The Chieftains are hugely popular but they also are determined to play Irish music their way only: "we have jobs we can go back to," they say.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091555</url></doc>
