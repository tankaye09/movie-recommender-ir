<plot>A longer film, differing somewhat from our other fire runs, inasmuch as it was taken upon the occurrence of an actual fire, and one of the most disastrous from which Louisville has recently suffered. The occasion warrants the belief that every nerve is strained and every effort is made to lose no time in reaching the danger point, and this very plainly appears in the film we present to our patrons. The Louisville fire brigade has the distinction of calling the oldest fire fighter in America its chief and his portrait is readily recognized in the admirable film we here present.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344207</url></doc>
