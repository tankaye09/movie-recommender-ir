<plot>Ayra Noche left the States when she found out that her father died, but that is not the only news she received. She found out that the hacienda is now owned by the family of their former stable boy and her childhood sweetheart, Edwin Torres. She could not believe how Edwin could do such a thing. Hatred replaced the love in her heart but she could not ignore that they still have feelings for each other. There is also another woman in Edwin's life, Donna Benitez. Edwin tries to solve the mystery as to how the hacienda came to be transferred to his family name. He discovers that the real enemy is closer than they imagined and could endanger the woman that he truly loves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394857</url></doc>
