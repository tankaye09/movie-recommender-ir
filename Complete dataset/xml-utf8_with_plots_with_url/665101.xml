<plot>A compilation of early-day silent films that serves as a glimpse back to the formative days of the movie industry. It is unlike most of the films featuring clips from old films as it shows scenes from French, Russian, Italian, British and American films made in the 1890s and early 1900s. Written and narrated by George Jessell and put together by Paul Weatherfax from over 150,000 feet of old footage, some of it printed on paper.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?665101</url></doc>
