<plot>Dave works nights in a video store, by day he fantasises about his beautiful co-worker Claire, re-enacting scenes in his head from the famous 1959 French New-Wave film "A Bout de Souffle". He is Jean-Paul Belmondo, and she Jean Seburg. But in reality, Dave is nothing like Jean-Paul Belmondo. And Claire only has four more shifts. Can he get past his obsession to realise that Claire likes him just as he is? Or will he remain trapped in his own imagination?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622686</url></doc>
