<plot>"The third of the Santa Claus series. This scene is full of excitement. It is Christmas morning, and in come the children, shouting with glee, to see what Santa Claus has brought them. Stockings are taken down; all the pretty toys are distributed, and the children dance about in delight. The action of this picture is so very natural, and the pleasure of the children so unfeigned that it appeals equally to young and old."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?104944</url></doc>
