<plot>A remarkably pleasing picture that will appeal to both young and old, for it is the sort of trick that every boy might play on a grandparent. Grandpa sits nodding in his armchair in the kitchen, where a stout jolly wash-woman from the Emerald Isle is engaged over the tub with the family wash. The woman is called away from the tub by the appearance of the ubiquitous book agent who enters the kitchen door. While she is engaged in conversation with the book agent, the small boy enters, secures a string, ties one end of it to grandpa's chair and the other end he ties to a towel which is hanging over the tub. The washerwoman finally ejects the book agent, who becomes a nuisance, and going back to the tub in a wrathful frame of mind begins vigorously wringing the clothes. The towel to which the string is secured is suddenly drawn into the wringer, and as grandpa is sitting with his feet on the stove and the chair tilted back a collision is brought about by the string, pulling grandpa and the tub together. Grandpa is thoroughly immersed in the foaming suds to the great amusement of both the boy and the book agent. The scene ends in a very ludicrous manner, as the woman is trying to help the old man up, slips on a piece of soap and herself falls into the mess. This is a crowning success as a comic picture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?018605</url></doc>
