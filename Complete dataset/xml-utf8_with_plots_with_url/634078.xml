<plot>Utopia is an epic film about the trials of an aged, successful attorney, Francis More, who is forced to wrestle with his internal demons, born from lust, pride, and selfishness in the midst of a legal battle that may leave his legacy tainted. The pinnacle of the case arrives and familial matters arise, including a neglected wife, scornful daughter, and an angry mistress.
