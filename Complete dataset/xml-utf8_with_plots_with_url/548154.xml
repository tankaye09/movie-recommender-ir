<plot>The decade between 1986 and 1996 witnessed the most exciting era ever in the annals of Irish soccer. Starting with the qualification for the 1988 Euro Finals, the period also saw Ireland qualify for the World Cup Finals in Italy in 1990 and the USA IN 1994. It was an era which put Ireland very much on the international map and was characterised above all by one man Jack Charlton whose central role turned Ireland from the Cinderella nation of world football to one of the most respected and most feared of soccer opponents. This film relives the great moments which have become known, collectively, as "The Charlton Years".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548154</url></doc>
