<plot>Featuring some of the most insane tricks seen in skateboarding, this movie is a must see. Witness the 540 on a 2 foot mini-ramp, the first ever 1 Footed Grind, the 360 1 Footed Nose Grind, and 1 Rock to Fakie - all from back in 1989. Todd is attacked at night by a supernatural being and escapes into a dark house. Then he has the chance to win 2 million dollars on the game show "Who Wants to Pull a Method Air." With many of Falcon's original moves as well as older stock footage from 1989-2000, this movie is insane!</plot><plot>Featuring some of the most insane tricks seen in skateboarding, this movie is a must see.
