<plot>In this game, you get watch 4 short movies that were based off of 4 manga stories featured in Monkey Punch's Lupin the 3rd manga. The titles include: "I Can't Stand It", "Tooth for a Tooth", "Hold Up", and "180 Lupins". With a total of a half an hour episode, and the ability to rewind and fast forward, making it look like you're watching a TV episode rather than playing a game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?470899</url></doc>
