<plot>Janet finds herself being treated unfairly by her family; her sister, Aurelia, receives all the attention, and she is constantly being scolded when she tries to obtain some attention. Despaired, she decides to run away from home. The gang call on an elderly couple (Tom and Mary Jones) to "adapt" Janet. To teach Janet a lesson, they agree to adopt her but make her life twice as miserable by making her scrub the floors. When Mrs. Jones calls Janet's family to take her back home, Janet and the gang run away to live in a cave. It is not long before they decide that the best thing to do is to return home. Janet finds herself lovingly reunited with her family. Her mother apologizes for her neglectful behavior and promises that it will never happen again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?188920</url></doc>
