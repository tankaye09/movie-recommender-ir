<plot>he heart wrenching love story between a married couple. The jobless husband cheats on his wife and has no love for her. The wife wants to go on a trip to get pregnant. This mismatched husband and wife may find sympathy among other lovers due to the excellent performance between Yakushimaru Hiroko, who was the main character in famous 'Kadokawa movies', and Toyokawa Etsushi, most well known for her role in [Love Letter]. Halfway through the film we understand why the original title of this movie was [A Good Husband This Time] while crying buckets of tears in being able to identify with the characters.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?296196</url></doc>
