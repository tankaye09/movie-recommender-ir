<plot>Having achieved worldwide recognition with a Golden Globe award for her work with Hans Zimmer on the soundtrack for 'Gladiator', Lisa Gerrard's life and work has influenced and touched many people. From her beginnings with the 1980's group Dead Can Dance, through to her success as a Hollywood film composer and a solo artist, Lisa Gerrard's powerful vocal and musical style has captivated fans and film goers alike for the past twenty years. From her childhood amongst the multi-cultural sounds of 1960's Melbourne, her musical influences range from her Celtic ancestry, native Australia, her years living and working in Europe through to the middle east. Treating her voice truly as an instrument, used alongside orchestration, playing the yang chin and cymbalon, she is able to create musical emotions, which are timeless and cross ethnic and spiritual divides. 'Sanctuary' contains music, performances, photographs and footage never seen or heard before including exclusive material due for release later in 2006.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476305</url></doc>
