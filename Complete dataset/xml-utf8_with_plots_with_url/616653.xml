<plot>This mini-series is a travelogue special on Japan, specially hosted by Singapore star Fann Wong. She travels around the trendy malls and hip towns of Tokyo, breezes through the cherry blossoms and admires the beautiful mountain scenery in Osaka, pays her respects to the war victims in Hiroshima (hit by the atomic bomb during World War 2), and enjoys hot spring baths in Sapporo. She does all this while introducing the sights and scenes of contemporary Japan, spicing up the otherwise staid documentary-like travelogue with her signature quips and antics, including visiting a Japanese family, dressing up as a geisha warrior and cooking a tin of freeze-dried porridge with hot spring water.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?616653</url></doc>
