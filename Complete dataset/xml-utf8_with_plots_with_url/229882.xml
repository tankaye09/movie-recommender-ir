<plot>A woman (Naglaa Fateh's character) bought a lottery ticket. She knew precisely what numbers the ticket contained, because she chose numbers meaningful to her. A thief stole her purse, which contained the ticket. She reported the theft to the police, including the numbers on the lottery ticket. The thief went into a nightclub, and sold the lottery ticket to one of the men who danced there (Mahmoud Reda's character). The ticket turned out to be the winning ticket. When the dancer went to the bank to claim his money, he was arrested for being the thief of the purse and lottery ticket. Of course, much confusion arose, and it became difficult to determine who should get the winnings because both individuals paid money for the ticket. Eventually it was resolved, and along the way the two fell in love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?229882</url></doc>
