<plot>David Grodin has an obsessive-compulsive personality. But he is also just plain obsessed with Maxine Smith, his ex-wife of five years and his business partner. Their small business is Mr &amp; Mrs, a small swimwear company he founded but that only became successful when she became its creative director. They work well together and are best friends, but Max feels that they just could not live together and be married to each other. They learn that because of a legal technicality, their divorce was never executed and thus they are still legally married. David sees this glitch as an opportunity to reunite with Max in wedded bliss. David's personal and professional plans hit a bump when into their office walks Carey Mays. Representing Fineway Industries, Carey has come with a lucrative offer to buy Mr &amp; Mrs. But Carey is also Max's high school sweetheart, something that still seems to be front in his mind. What David does not know about the business proposal is that Fineway wants to retain Max's services, but not his. Both David and Max let their emotions dictate what they decide to do both professionally and personally.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424501</url></doc>
