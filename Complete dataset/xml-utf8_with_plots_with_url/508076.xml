<plot>How far will you go for love? A story of amazing courage of two souls who go beyond all rules and precedents to live a life outside of what you've ever known possible for family for love and for the uncompromising drive for inner peace. A true story that surpasses gender, a new twist on the female buddy movie, about two highly committed people whose lives are so inextricably bound they are compelled to transform their traditional marriage to a relationship of two souls deeply tied to one other. This inspiring and provocative drama focuses on the triumph of the human spirit about a daring person who risks everything to realize a dream. My purpose in making movies is to leave people moved, inspired, and entertained by creating new paradigms that stretch the limits of our thinking.I was so inspired by the real life of the lead character, the courage, integrity and remarkable inner strength that I felt compelled to have her life known. The contrasting facets of her life seemed best expressed by starkly contrasting scenes, taken to the extremes, then juxtaposed and held together by the story line itself. This modular approach was inspired by the contemporary American painter, Frank Stella, whose paintings are a juxtaposition of extreme modules all held together by form and color. To make Soulmates I had to summon up my own courage and push my creative limits. My daily mantra was "take it to the extremes, and make the impossible possible."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?508076</url></doc>
