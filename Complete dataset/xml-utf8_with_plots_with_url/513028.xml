<plot>Judy decides to upgrade her life by buying a computer. Not knowing a thing about them, she purchases the biggest, most power system she can from a computer geek, named Chet who is of questionable nature and reputation. After a series of mishaps - a freak power surge and cross wiring it, something amazing happens - the computer gains self-awareness! Using its word processor, speakers and microphone, the computer begins to communicate with the world and Judy, thinking that she has some kind of Cyber-Stalker, goes on a wild goose chase trying to figure if she has gone completely mental.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513028</url></doc>
