<plot>Zach Hughes is a bookstore worker who loves to read and listen to music. The problem is he listens to his music player wherever he goes, having those around him think he is a complete loser, but all Zach is trying to do is break free from his boring and downer life. When his music player is stolen while helping an attractive customer, he must break from the norm and try to get the player back. Along the way his lazy beer drinking roommate and a girl who may want more than help finding books will aid Zach in finding the real thing he is searching for: what life is really about.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?232963</url></doc>
