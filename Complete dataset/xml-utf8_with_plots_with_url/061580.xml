<plot>"Each year there is assembled at the great training grounds at Aldershot an immense army of Great Britain's soldiery. This annual encampment is the occasion of trials of skill in military games between the most noted athletes of the service. This picture shows a bayonet duel between two experts. The men wear heavily padded jackets and immense masks, and the onslaught is very furious. A group of noncommissioned officers and privates look on and applaud the various skillful moves."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061580</url></doc>
