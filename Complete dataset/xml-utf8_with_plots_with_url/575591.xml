<plot>Universal's 64th of 69 sound-era serials (between "Jungle Queen" with Ruth Roman and their 2nd version of "Secret Agent X-9" with Lloyd Bridges), is set in 1938 with Nazi agents kidnapping scientist Professor Ellwood Henderson (Byron Foulger, at his meekest, mildest and milquetoast-irritating best) in order to get his Orotron machine that can extract gold from seawater. Operating under the secret leadership of "The Master Key", with the operatives headed by a German agent posing as a private investigator named Garrett Donovan (Addison Richards), the gang is trailed by Federal agent Tom Brant (Milburn Stone), aided by police detective Lieutenant Jack Ryan (Dennis Moore) and newspaper reporter Janet Lowe (Jan Wiley.) Also aiding in the quest is Police Chief William J. O'Brien (Russell Hicks) and his secretary Dorothy Arnold (Maris Wrixon.) It takes Brant nearly 12 of the 13 episodes to figure out that since the Nazis learn of his and Ryan's plans almost before they clear police headquarters, then "The Master Key" must be somebody close to them. Most of the leg-work is done by a group of boys under the leadership of candy-notions store owner Aggie (Sarah Padden) with the leader of the club boys being one Alfred La Rue (prior to his "Lash" days) as Migsy. Lots of stock street footage from earlier Dead Ends/Little Tough Guys films made by Universal, and several other Universal serials.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575591</url></doc>
