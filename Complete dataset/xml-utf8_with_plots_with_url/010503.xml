<plot>Adam invites Pach, a high class escort, over to his house for wine, cheese, and what appears to be harmless 'roleplay,' but soon his malevolent intentions are revealed as he leads Peach down into his cellar when unimaginable evil awaits her... in the form of a foetus preserved in a jar in which Adam intends to surgically implant into Peach so that the foetus will live. Peach attempts to escape but is quickly captured and knocked out for Adam to complete the operation. As Adam quietly celebrates with the corpse of his deceased wife, Peach hears the voice of the foetus speaking to her and manipulates her to stab Adam in the back with a rib bone Adam had to remove from her during the surgery, and run off with his child and all his money. The end?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010503</url></doc>
