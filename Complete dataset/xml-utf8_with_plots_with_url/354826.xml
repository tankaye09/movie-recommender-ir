<plot>Sixty-one-year-old Chaim lives with his ninety-five-year-old mother, a concentration camp survivor. Knowing what his parents had endured, Chaim made it his mission in life to care for them as they got older and now attends to his mother 24 hours a day. These lively and humorous characters share both the light-hearted antics of daily life and the tears and memories of the Holocaust. Like his name, Chaim stands for life. With faith and humor, he accepts his fate and never gives up hope. L'Chaim! (To Life!)</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354826</url></doc>
