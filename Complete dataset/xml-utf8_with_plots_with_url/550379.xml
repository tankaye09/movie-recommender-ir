<plot>In one of the quaint but less affluent neighborhoods of Miami's East Little Havana two Cuban-American sisters rent a spare bedroom in their dilapidated mansion to a wealthy young aristocratic whom they suspect is a "vampiro." The situation is complicated by the unexpected arrival of their homeless niece: a former nun who presumably "ran away" from the cloister. Enter the classic villains: a "medieval wizard" and his venomous accomplice on a potentially lethal mission. Their destinies are linked and transformed by a magical talisman with the power to break an ancient spell. "The Count" is an ingenious, extremely hilarious, fast-paced and highly suspenseful satire on the classic vampire myth with unique, outrageous characters, fantasy, music and romance deliciously spiced with an erotic, Latin flavor to sink your fangs into!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550379</url></doc>
