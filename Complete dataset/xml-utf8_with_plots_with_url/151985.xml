<plot>All of Disney's most beloved princesses join together for one unforgettable enchanted evening in this release that offers the familiar holiday songs and stories with a few exciting surprises. Arielle, Cinderella, Belle, Aurora, Jasmine, and Snow White are all here, and they've brought along a healthy dose of holiday cheer. If anyone can cheer up the grouchy Beast it's Belle, and after Ariel reads a touching tale about her first Christmas, Aurora offers her own unique interpretation of "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy". Before the lights go out on this all-star holiday spectacular, all of the Disney princesses join together for an all-new song celebrating the magic of the Christmas season.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?151985</url></doc>
