<plot>On a deserted country highway, just south of EXIT 34, Bruce and his wife Carrie have run out of gas. Bruce, deciding to take the initiative, heads off, canister in hand, to find the nearest pump, leaving Carrie behind to stay with the car in case someone drives by. On the same highway, Gord sits by himself, waiting for a reason to get up, until Bruce shows up, looking for a gas station. And the deal is made, Gord will guide Bruce to the nearest pump, in exchange for a ride to where he needs to go. So the two of them head off down the road and over a bridge, but somehow, even though they are walking the opposite way, they come across Bruce's car, and Carrie is nowhere to be found. Where could she have gone? How did they get back around to the car anyway? And what does EXIT 34 have to do with all this? As Bruce contemplates all these questions, Gord gets increasingly more impatient, and needs to take some drastic measures to show Bruce the answers that he's looking for.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185374</url></doc>
