<plot>A lonely middle aged woman, Anne-Grethe, takes refuge from the cold in a pizza parlor. The warm and friendly owner, the immigrant Hakim, comforts her. There is an instant connection between them and they can't help but be fascinated by each other. Anne-Grethe invites Hakim to join her square dance team, but when they show up, the rest of the team won't accept the newcomer. Anne-Grethe doesn't realize that it is because Hakim is an immigrant, and is embarrassed when Hakim has to explain it to her. They choose to stick together no matter what people think. Unfortunately their happy moment is brief, as Hakim is torn away and Anne-Grethe is left alone, determined to show the world how she felt about Hakim.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?056385</url></doc>
