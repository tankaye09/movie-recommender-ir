<plot>Before they had "Jackass" or "The Tom Green Show" MTV had the reality series "Buzzkill" which featured three slacker buddies staging elaborate pranks and catching it all on tape with the help of special hidden cameras. Such pranks included fake auditions, fake fashion shows and photo shoots, one member of the series even got away with successfully impersonating fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi at a gala event and even super-star Whitney Houston was fooled (Ms. Houston was not happy when she learned it was a hoax).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?088428</url></doc>
