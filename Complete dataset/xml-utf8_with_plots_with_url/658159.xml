<plot>In this ground-breaking quiz show, two contestants one a returning champion competed to answer questions on various topics ranging from general knowledge questions, to identifying objects while blindfolded, to answering questions about a skit or movie clip they had just seen, etc. Each correct answer was worth one point, with three points required to win. Winners received a merchandise prize and the right to compete against a new contestant. Champions remained on the show until defeated. "Winner Take All" the first game show produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was a pioneer game show of sorts: It was the first to use a lockout buzzer for contestants to signal they wanted to answer and it was the first to declare returning champions. Those two elements figured into the countless game shows that would follow.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658159</url></doc>
