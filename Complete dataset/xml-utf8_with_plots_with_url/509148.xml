<plot>We wish to call the attention of our customers to the fact that we are now prepared to furnish them with nine of the most vivid and life-like bull fight pictures ever produced. These pictures were taken at great expense. Do not confound them with others that show nothing but the ring. Our pictures are complete in every detail. It is not necessary to show more, as we succeed in getting the principal parts only -- those that are interesting. They are in 50-foot lengths and are perfect. Order by code word. These pictures must be seen to be appreciated; they certainly are money-makers, and at our prices can be easily purchased by any live exhibitor.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?509148</url></doc>
