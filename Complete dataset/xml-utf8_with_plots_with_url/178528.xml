<plot>During the Winter of 1863 a Confederate Soldier is alone on picket duty on the far outskirts of his camp. As the darkness of the night comes closer the Confederate Soldier decides to take a break and start a fire for some coffee and warmth. Realizing he doesn't have a lot of water he is forced to head back to the stream he passed and fill up his canteen. While on his way back to his fire he sees a distant figure sitting by the fire. Not willing to take any chances he approaches hesitantly with his musket drawn. He discovers that this figure was in fact a Union Soldier. They spend the night warming themselves by the fire talking about home and life, coming to the realization that it is better to be friends then enemies for the night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?178528</url></doc>
