<plot>The last collaboration of Armenia's two most important documentary auteurs, 'Mikhail Vartanov' (qv) and 'Artavazd Peleshian' (qv). The first was _Osennyaya pastoral (1971)_ (qv) which Artavazd Peleshian wrote and Vartanov directed and this film the "Seasons of the Year" (1975) which Pelechian directed and for the first time used no archive footage likely due to the exquisite cinematography by Vartanov. Peleshian's brilliant "Seasons" is probably one of the 3 most important documentary films made in Armenia, along with Paradjanov's _Hakob Hovnatanyan (1967)_ (qv) and Vardanov's _Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992)_ (qv). "Seasons" is an outstanding look at the co-existence of Nature and People and is perhaps Peleshian's best film after which 8 years passed before he made another one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?644229</url></doc>
