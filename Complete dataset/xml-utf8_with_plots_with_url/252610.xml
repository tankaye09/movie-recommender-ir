<plot>Since birth Isabella has lived in Tribeca, New York City, in the shadow of the World Trade Center towers. The Twin Towers served as her north star, by which she learned to navigate her neighborhood and recognize the way home. Her community - the protected, secure, and innocent world of her childhood - was shattered on September 11th. Over the following months, Jezebel Productions filmed Isabella's attempts to make sense of the enormity of sudden changes in her life, most significantly her loss of innocence. Out of her classroom window she had seen bodies falling from the north tower, a sight she has been unable to forget but until recently refused to talk about. Growing up is usually a gentle, gradual process for middle class girls in the Western world; however Isabella's experiences have catapulted her into a maturity beyond her years. The film focuses on her personal journey since that fateful day, starting with her evacuation from home and culminating in the reopening of her neighborhood school in February 2002.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252610</url></doc>
