<plot>The video begins as the first hand experience of an American tourist who is confronted with the enigma of Berlin's mystique being conspicuously absent of the accumstomed archetecture as represented in the films of the last century. Neighborhood after neighborhood is analogised in a combination of photographic imagery in tandum with computer animated sequences, test from journal entries and period music relating to former bygone eras. The slow transition from the mundane atmosphere of just another tourist experience to a prophetic flash of the uncanny linkage of contemporary American Petro-Imperialism with the failed empire of National Socialist Fascism is revealed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?041948</url></doc>
