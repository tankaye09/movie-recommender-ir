<plot>In the heart of Los Angeles, five strangers with extremely different views of dogs spend a day sharing their personal views with one another. As they try to convince each other that their opinion of dogs is 'right' and the other opinion is 'wrong', it becomes evident that their clashing beliefs go much deeper than how they view their animals. Confronting issues surrounding cultural and social class differences, their encounters provide a thought-provoking look at whether or not society is willing to cast aside its judgments in order to understand different ways of life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?437177</url></doc>
