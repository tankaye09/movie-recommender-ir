<plot>This is a very amusing scene. You see a man and wife having a lively scrimmage as the result of the husband coming home late. A well meaning friend interferes and tries to help the wife, whereupon she turns upon him with a broom and teaches him that is never safe to interfere in family troubles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?393709</url></doc>
