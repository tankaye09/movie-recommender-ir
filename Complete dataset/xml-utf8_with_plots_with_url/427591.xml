<plot>On one hand, we have Chinese student Chi Lyn preparing for a part he's soon to play. On the other, we have two Americans, one black, one white, trying to regain the intimacy of their university. Cutting back and forth between two continents, this is a film concerning politics and culture straddling America and China.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427591</url></doc>
