<plot>Through story of bass babloon, a field of cotton that belongs to a kibbutz 'Mishmarot', Meir Ariels song talks about the development and disintegration of the kibbutz movement along the ages. With his super eight camera Meir captured the working spirit of the pioneers and their hard earth labour. As the song continues and portray the hardships the kibbutz has encountered we see visuals that are filled with nostalgia and love for the difficult earth.
