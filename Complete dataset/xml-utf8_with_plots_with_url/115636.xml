<plot>The wonderful machine which this film brings before the eyes of an audience performs the same function for corn as the ordinary harvester does for the grain. Owing to the greater weight the successful harvesting of corn has presented many difficulties; the latest type of machine, however, has overcome them all, and in this picture is clearly seen the almost human-life ability in which the machine cuts, gathers and binds the corn. This film is particularly interesting as showing the triumph of man's ingenuity over apparently insuperable difficulties.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115636</url></doc>
