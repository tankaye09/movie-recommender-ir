<plot>The filmmaker's journey began the day after the tragic events of September 11th, 2001. After receiving an email from a family friend who recounted how he had escaped World Trade Center Tower 1 moments before it imploded. After reading this email the filmmaker, Arthur Klein, was unable to stay at work. Devastated by the current events, he left his office in the middle of the day and in street cloths went to a yoga class. "It seemed like a good place to begin to regain a sense of peace, balance and wellbeing in a world that had seemingly begun to collapse." A year after beginning this every day yoga practice, Arthur was approached by two of his teachers and invited to capture what was unfolding in the yoga community. So for the last 6 years it has been his sadhana to explore, question and capture this emerging distinctly Western voice in yoga through a compelling collection of diverse American yogic stories. Y Yoga captures the philosophy, intention and spirit of Yoga from a charter school born out of riot torn South Central Los Angeles, to American soldiers in Iraq as they are taught 'Yoga for Regular Guys' by world famous wrestler Diamond Dallas Page. Through a combination of interviews, drama, humor, music and inspiring imagery, "Y Yoga" documents how this ancient technology is alive and well today in the United States spreading love and light resulting in peace and happiness for many. It is the film maker's hope that "Y Yoga" will introduce people to their first yogic experience from the comfort of their easy chair. If this film inspires you about yoga then it has served its purpose well. Furthermore if you are inspired, please take action and share Y Yoga with someone you know who could use the yoga. Since, the world will be a better place the more of us who experience yoga and meditation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663191</url></doc>
