<plot>Many of us have participated in a ride on the yachts at Atlantic City, but there has never been a good picture taken thereof as this has always seemed a difficult picture to obtain. We were successful, however, in getting a perfect picture of a yachting party on their yacht, showing same leaving the pier, in mid-ocean, and finally returning, some of them much the worse for the ride. This is also a beautiful water effect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?663490</url></doc>
