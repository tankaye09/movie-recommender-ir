<plot>The angry wife has placed a large tub under the bed and is filling it with water, as the scene opens. She covers it with a bedspread to conceal it. Soon her husband comes in much the worse for drink. He throws his hat and coat on a chair, and is about to sit on the bed to take off his shoes, but sits down into the tub of water instead. He gets up soaked, and his wife makes things worse by beating him with a broom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008725</url></doc>
