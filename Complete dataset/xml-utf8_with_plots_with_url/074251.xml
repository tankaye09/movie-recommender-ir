<plot>"This film is particularly interesting. Shows another method the soldier boys have for amusing themselves in their leisure moments. New comrades are frequently initiated by the old-fashioned sport of tossing in a blanket. The newly arrived recruit, who is the victim of their sport, enjoys himself, perhaps, less than the other participants."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074251</url></doc>
