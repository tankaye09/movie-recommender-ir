<plot>Brentwood, the aged RCMP officer tells this story to his grand-daughter about his favorite dog-sled leader in his young days. Okemow, a dog treated specially since its puppyhood, gets its big break one day, when it gets to be the leader of a sled team for the first time. They travel for a long time, when he finally stops. After much confusion, it turns out that he has saved his master and his dog team from disaster: a deadly ice hole.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?022220</url></doc>
