<plot>"Life in a camp has its work and duties even when the soldiers are not engaged in actual warfare; among these the daily drill is the event of the day and sometimes considered a hardship by the soldiers themselves, although absolutely necessary to keep the men in good health and training. The soldier-like bearing of the boys on parade is especially noticeable in this film, which like the last two is an ever popular subject with an audience in any part of the country."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?124470</url></doc>
