<plot>A film that shows what it's like to be a staff member or camper at a Jewish sleep-away summer camp. The documentary focuses on the camp's three day color war (known as Maccabiah) and the personalities of the staff members involved. The film also examines the traditions, eccentricities, and culture of summer camp in general. Documented over 8 weeks by longtime summer camp staff members, this film provides an insider's look at camp culture that will evoke memories for anyone who knows the joy that comes with spending a summer away from home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130756</url></doc>
