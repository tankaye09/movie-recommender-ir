<plot>Champraj, king of Bundi (Jamshedji), boasts in the court of the maharaja Karansingh of his wife Sone's (Jilloo) purity and fidelity. The villainous Sher Singh (Hadi) claims to prove otherwise and, through trickery, appropriates a dagger and a handkerchief by which Sone had said she would remember her husband in his absence. Champraj, who stakes his life on his wife's fidelity, is about to be be-headed when Sone herself, dressed as a dancing-girl, exposes the truth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?478362</url></doc>
