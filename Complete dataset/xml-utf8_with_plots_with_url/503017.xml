The US goverment has gathered intelligence that an unknown terrorist group has hijacked a ship filled with mass-produced versions of Metal Gear, the "devil's weapon of destruction". Moreover, the terrorist leader is said to have a new Metal Gear prototype hidden inside their main base, which is rumored to be seven times more powerful than the original. The FOXHOUND unit brings back Solid Snake, the saboteur responsible for destroying the original Metal Gear three years ago, to lead a dangerous new mission dubbed "Operation 747". With the help of fellow FOXHOUND members, John Turner and Nick Myer, and Jennifer, a former resistance member from Outer Heaven, Snake must neutralize the terrorist activity and come face to face with the enemy leader.......his former commander, Big Boss.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?503017</url></doc>
