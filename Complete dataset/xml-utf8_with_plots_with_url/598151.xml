<plot>After her husband dies, Ella and her two children, Lena and Fletcher, must move from their plush life in Malibu to the family farm of a somewhat distant relative, Vincent. Ella tries to make the best of it for her kids, but they all struggle with their new environment and the loss of their Dad. Ella's growing fear of the hereditary effects of suicide causes new problems. The Uniform Motion of Folly refers to the inability of some people to deviate from a course they have so much invested in, even if that course is not in their best interest.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598151</url></doc>
