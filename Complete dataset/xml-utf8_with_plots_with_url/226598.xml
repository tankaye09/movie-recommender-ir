<plot>The film follows a season of the Hope Lions, a boy's soccer team from a famous lower class Tel Aviv neighborhood. They are pushed by their parents and coach to become professional players since the regular education system has failed them miserably. The coach sees himself as their educator, yet struggles with the idea of whether to allow more fortunate and intelligent children on the team. He wonders about a society that places greater emphasis on a sport profession rather than on education. He has yet to question whether girls should also be allowed on the team.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226598</url></doc>
