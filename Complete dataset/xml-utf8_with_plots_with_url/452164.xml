<plot>Archie is a rich and utterly despicable practical joker. He is one week away from playing a CD-Rom that will change the lives of his trusted manager Dexter and other employees forever, when he is suddenly involveed in a deadly accident. Archie quickly discoveres that instead of enterting heaven's pearly gates, he is being sent back to earth to clean up the mess he's created. Since Archie has an absolute dislike for animals, especially dogs, it is quickly decided he return to earth as a dog. Not any dog, mind you, but a fluffy white Pomeranian named "Quigley." Sweeney, an "observing" guardian angel, will accompany him. He is the only person who will actually see the real Archie. Everyone else sees Quigley. He's given two very different assignments. One is to retrieve the CD-Rom before it's played and the other is to help his brother, Woodward and his family, whom he hasn't talked to in years. Quigley, (a very confused Archie), has much to do and little time to do it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452164</url></doc>
