<plot>The public never grows tired of war pictures, as is evidenced by the enormous sale of films treating on the subject. They show their appreciation in the repeated encores, and the profits derived from these exhibitions are flattering in the extreme. We rarely are treated with a view of charging cavalry, and therefore look on this great picture with awe as the men with drawn sabres dash forward on their spirited horses, and you imagine for a moment that they are the real article. Very exciting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034728</url></doc>
