<plot>February '99. Klaus Maria Brandauer arrives in London for his English-speaking stage debut in Esther Vilar's Speer. Directing and playing the title role, he and his co-star Sven Eric Bechtolf have 12 days to prepare for their challenge. Film-maker Martin Wagner, who also translated the play, had unprecedented access to the rehearsals. His film captures the underlying tension as the opening night approaches and provides a unique and unpretentious insight into one of the finest actors of his generation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?294159</url></doc>
