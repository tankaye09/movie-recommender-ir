<plot>If you are cold - you'll warm somehow, if you are hungry - you'll eat something, but if you feel cold in your heart and your soul - then it is terrible. If you are not loved, you suffer and you feel like lost in the huge world, with no support and protection. Everyone has the right and desires to be loved. The official number of children living in specialized institutions for children with no parent care is more then 8600. More then 8600 Bulgarian children. Most of them ate emotionally and socially harmed and are not able to get their full potential after gaining their majority. Bulgaria has much higher percentage children in institutions then the other EU countries. Most of those children are not orphans and have living parents. Orphans are only about 2% of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097990</url></doc>
