<plot>Although a synopsis of this film appears in Motion Picture World on 15 November 1913, there is no reliable documentation that a film bearing this title was ever released at this time. Most likely, the title was changed and the film was released under another title.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?240262</url></doc>
