<plot>Rabbit lives in the country with his three children: Peter, Lucy, and Emily. He is a very cunning guy who's always looking forward to getting into tight situations with his childhood friend Terraspin. The next thing Rabbit knows is that he has a new next-door neighbor. He is with open arms, _until_ he discovers his next-door neighbor's a wolf (who's named Wolf), especially one who does not like him. But, to his surprise his daughter, Lucy, likes Wolf's children and they like her. He thinks this is a trap and tells her she can't hang out with them while Wolf is telling his couch-potato sons, Barry and Simon, they should hunt rabbits not be friends with them. His sons however rather sit around eatting pizza and watching tv.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?155487</url></doc>
