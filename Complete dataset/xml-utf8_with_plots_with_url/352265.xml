<plot>Mahagiri, the industrious gentle elephant is the pet of the entire village. Mahagiri helps in daily chores carrying heavy logs for the villagers and giving joyrides to children too. A temple is to be built in the village and Mahagiri is summoned to install a pole for the flag. Much to the chagrin of the mahout, Mahagiri refuses to install the pole. Everyone is perplexed at Mahagiri's disobedience. It turns out that there is a cat sleeping in the hole where the pole is to be installed and Mahagiri didn't want to hurt the poor creature.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?352265</url></doc>
