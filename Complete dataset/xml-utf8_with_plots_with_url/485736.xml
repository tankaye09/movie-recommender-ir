<plot>Unlike the earlier two films in this series, this film looks at some of the sadder aspects of young romance. In the first part, Miya and Shinji are best friends in school, but Miya thinks she wants their relationship to be something more. Will she be able to speak her mind to Shinji, or will she resign herself to just being friends? In the second part, Kyoko finds herself drawn to Keigo, a tough loner with a bad reputation. Her efforts to make him appreciate her become more and more self-destructive, but will they have any effect?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?485736</url></doc>
