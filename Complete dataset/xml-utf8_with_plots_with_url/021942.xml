<plot>Misha, Dolton, Jaxon, Hamlet, and David are young aspiring actors who move to Hollywood to follow their dream, but wind up testing their fate with consequences beyond their wildest imagination. Each of the actors have been hand picked by 'The Master'. A dark, mysterious teacher who promises to teach them the ultimate secret to success. Without knowing it, the young faithful dreamers are set to the test of their lives. They are hypnotized, mentally and physically abused and brainwashed as The Master slowly steals away any human instinct and empathy from them and applies a strange animal behavior instead. He calls it his unique acting technique. But in spite of all their hopes, dreams and aspirations The Master is never planning on giving them the secret to success. He has his own dark agenda. He is the hungry wolf in the jungle waiting for the right moment to prey on little girls. Just like the fairy tale of 'Little Red Riding Hood'.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?021942</url></doc>
