<plot>Soma, the son of a great hero who banished yin from the world in the previous war, is now chosen by the great sword of yang. At first, the spirit of the sword will overwhelm his body to protect him from the darkness of Yin. Unless Soma gets stronger, he will consummate his own life. Evidently, the sword is not complete. He must travel the very world to find the missing pieces of the sword's power. In the process he will get strong enough to command Yang's power. Along the way, he meets Arumi, the Heavenly Princess with an equally sacred dagger, Ryuhai, a childhood friend whom is also a ninja and Tanh, a member of a shadow-less clan wanting to retrieve back his clan's treasure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?505569</url></doc>
