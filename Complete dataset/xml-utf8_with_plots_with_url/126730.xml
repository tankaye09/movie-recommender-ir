<plot>Leaving his home on the edge of the Palmdale Desert, young writer Ben Anderson is heading to the bright lights of Hollywood. On his way he finds a shiny new TV by the side of a desert road. When Ben takes possession of the TV and happily takes it into his home, he also invites the spirit of a long dead priest into his life. Ben and his friends soon begin to find out why Pride, Greed, Lust, Envy, Sloth, Gluttony and Wrath are the Seven Deadly Sins. Even the appearance of the strangely enigmatic Detective Abe Johnson cannot stop the entity as it plays judge and jury to the supposed 'sinners' who appear before it. The next seven days become a fight for survival, ending in a dangerous exorcism ritual which takes Ben back out into the desert. "Blessed are you if the Vigilant visits your dwelling from Sabbath to Sabbath. But beware those who appear before him for you shall be judged".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126730</url></doc>
