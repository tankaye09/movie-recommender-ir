<plot>There May Be Pleasure is the story of two college students, Nathan and Keren. The two are working on a film project together, only he's more interested in her than his grade. The story unfolds as Nathan is filming a scene for the project. In each progressive shot, we follow Nathan's internal dialog as it reveals how he feels about Keren. Perhaps letting on more, than he would like.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?603598</url></doc>
