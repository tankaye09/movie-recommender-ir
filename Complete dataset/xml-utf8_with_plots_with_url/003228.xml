<plot>Ben Wright is your average guy. He works hard and was saving for his future... then his wife was diagnosed with cancer and within a month died. He was devastated and kept all the pain bottled up. One year later he's struggling to overcome the loss. On the one year anniversary date his brother in law drops by. Trying to coax Ben into visiting the grave, he fails. Ben opens his shop as usual. Going through the monotony f the day, his thoughts are preoccupied. Suddenly, a face from the past startles him. The mysterious woman talks genially with Ben then forces him to face the truth of his sadness. As she leaves him to ponder we discover that Ben has just had a conversation with his dead wife. Was it a ghost or just his mind forcing him to move on? At night, Ben visits the grave for the first time in a year and lays flowers.</plot><plot>Ben Wright is your average guy.
