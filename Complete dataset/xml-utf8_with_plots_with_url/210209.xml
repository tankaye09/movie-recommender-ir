<plot>Dominic &amp; Debbie are hopelessly in love. They live with Granddad but dream of a place of their own. We see their nervous excitement as Dominic prepares for the biggest day of his life...an interview, which - if successful - will give them what they have always wanted. But what will happen to Granddad? Increasingly frail, he shows signs of losing his faculties and we wonder who is to care for him as his health deteriorates? Set amidst New Labour's 1997 election victory, this is a film about love &amp; aspiration at the expense of morality in post Thatcher Britain.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?210209</url></doc>
