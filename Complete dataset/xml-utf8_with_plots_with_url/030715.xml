<plot>A portrait of the singer as he recounts his Montreal childhood, his New York breakthrough, and his subsequent successes worldwide. Openly gay, Rufus provides a frank and revealing look at his life, including his going temporarily blind from drug problems. With comments by his sister and his mother, musicians Elton John, Sting, Neil Tennant ("Pet Shop Boys"), Tom ?? ("Keane"), and showcasing his talents on solo piano as well as with his band, this is a fascinating film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030715</url></doc>
