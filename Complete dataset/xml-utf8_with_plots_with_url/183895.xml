<plot>'Eve' deals with the themes of a man coming to terms with the recent death of his girlfriend. Nick struggles to escape from the memories of Eve that surround him in the apartment that they used to live in together. Having tended to Eve in the last weeks of her life as she slowly lost her battle with a longterm illness, Nick saw what was once a dreamlike existence dissolve slowly into a nightmare. As he struggles with his grief, Nick finds himself torn between the past and the present and as a result the lines between dream and reality become increasingly blurred.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183895</url></doc>
