While researching for an audition for the role of Freddy Krueger in an upcoming remake of "A Nightmare On Elm Street" at a local diner his friend, Sid, coincidentally shows up to the same diner. Sid does nothing to encourage Owen in his career and only belittles him for being a horrible actor. While in the midst of "being mean" to people in the restaurant, like Freddy would, Owen and Sid's table is served by Jules. Owen taken an immediate liking to her and Sid knows it right away. Owen wants to make a move on her, but refuses to break character. He tries to ask her out as Freddy, but does not succeed. Sid does all he can to help Owen, but ends up making things worse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554267</url></doc>
