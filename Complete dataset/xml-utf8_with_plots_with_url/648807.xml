<plot>A short film about female sexuality, making the viewer aware of body image and attitudes towards it by frequent images of two naked females and close-up shots of areas that make them female. The two women discuss what makes them paranoid; fearful, doubtful and also joyful and erotic, in relation to their own bodies.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648807</url></doc>
