<plot>Wolves are plainly seen trying to break their way out of the cage in order to get the food carried by the keeper to some other animals. Every one knows how ferocious wolves are from what has been written about them, but many have never seen this beast, and to this element our picture appeals. This film will pay for itself wherever you show it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400498</url></doc>
