<plot>Bombay Police are baffled at a series of robberies being committed in homes of prominent people, with the thief leaving a "swastika", and stealing only one set of jewelery, instead of everything in the safe. Their investigation takes them to bring-in a notorious burglar, Tony, who denies having anything to do with these robberies. Then one day when Tony is at the site of a robbery, he spots another male, in the process of robbing the safe, and assists him. He follows him home, and comes to know that his name is Bob, and he has a pretty sister by the name of Sandhya, who he falls in love with. Meanwhile the police are able to piece together a connection between the victims and the robber, and conclude that the victims have at one time been partners of an organization called Swastika. Then begins a manhunt unprecedented in Bombay's criminal history - and the two on the run are none other than Tony and his new-found girlfriend/partner, Sandhya, not knowing that they are all pawns of a criminal master-mind who will kill anyone who gets in his way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152980</url></doc>
