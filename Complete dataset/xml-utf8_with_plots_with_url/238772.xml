<plot>Many pictures of diving from high places have been taken, but this one eclipses all we know of. After many of the boys have performed a number of difficult stunts they begin to come out of the water backwards. The fellows who jump from a height of probably sixty feet, appear suddenly and shoot in the air as though fired out of a cannon. We know of no better picture for a headliner in a short subject than this.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?238772</url></doc>
