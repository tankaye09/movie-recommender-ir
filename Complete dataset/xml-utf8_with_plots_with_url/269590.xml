<plot>Karthik (Charan) is a happy-go-lucky guy and the only son in a wealthy family. His mother Lakshmi (Poonam Dhillon) and father Chakravarthy (Sarat Babu) take care of him very well. Neha (Sreya) is the daughter of Subbu (Chandra Mohan) and she is motherless. Karthik is the senior of Neha in the college and rags her a lot. Neha rescues Lakshmi at an incident and joins her in hospital. Over a period of time Neha and Lakshmi become thick friends. The family member of Neha likes Karthik. The family of Karthik loves Neha a lot. Lakshmi refuses, when Subbu proposes to the parents of Karthik to marry off Karthik and Neha. If you want to know why she refused to marry this pair off and how these guys work hard to impress upon the parents, you gotta watch this film on the silver screen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269590</url></doc>
