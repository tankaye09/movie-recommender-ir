<plot>Charlie has a present for his family... a brand new TV set. However, once he turns it on, he gets nothing but "zig-zag lines". He complains over the phone and is told he needs to install an aerial. He refuses to pay someone else to do it and is convinced he can do it himself. Bad decision! First he must get up to the roof after his ladder falls apart. Once making it to the roof, he has difficulty staying up there. Eventually, the TV winds up at the bottom of their swimming pool but Charlie isn't licked yet. Wearing scuba gear, the family watches TV from the pool's bottom!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?467924</url></doc>
