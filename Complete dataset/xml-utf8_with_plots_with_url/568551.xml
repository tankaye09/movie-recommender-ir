<plot>With his radio blaring Three Dog Night's "Never Been to Spain," a shirtless man lounges on the hood of his sporty car; he smokes a cigarette as he stretches and shows off his physique. A young woman calls to him from a love seat on the front porch of a large house across the street. She's barefoot, sucking on a watermelon lollipop. He goes over to her and the verbal fencing begins. It looks like it's headed for a kiss, but he's going steady with someone else and she may not be exactly what she seems. By the end, someone has to weigh conflicting information and make an important spring-day decision.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568551</url></doc>
