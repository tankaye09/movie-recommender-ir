<plot>Michael, a troubled teenager from an East London estate is easily led astray, despite his good intentions. Though warned by his overworked mum about his need to start taking his education seriously, Michael is talked into skipping school by his best mate, Cameron. The two boys hang out with Keith, a troublemaker who bullies them into shoplifting. Cameron, eager to impress, obeys while Michael tries to stand his ground. Doing the right thing doesn't lead to reward for Michael, who ultimately learns one of life's hardest lessons - bad things happen to good people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381344</url></doc>
