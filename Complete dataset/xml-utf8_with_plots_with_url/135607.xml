<plot>Greg Winters is a slacker city trucker whose whole life changes when he accidentally hits a jogger with his cargo truck in the middle of a deserted rural road. Fearful of the repercussions on his already messed up life, Greg flees the scene and manages to hide his clunky damaged truck on the nearby overgrown farm of Martha Thompson, an aging grouchy widow who lives by the scriptures, ideas of traditional family and her trusty shotgun. Greg puts up with Martha's harsh criticism in exchange for a place to lay-low until he can evade the police and repair his delicate relationship with his young daughter, Chelsea. Just when it seems Martha's influence may be having a favorable effect on Greg's attitude, his old ways win out. With fate closing in and time running out, the pressure mounts on Greg to change, the only question is will it be too late?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?135607</url></doc>
