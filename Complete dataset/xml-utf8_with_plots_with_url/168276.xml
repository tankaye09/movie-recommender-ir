Taking advantage of this, Chandolha's Advocate, Bhujang Rao, implicates him in a false police complaint, and has him committed to a mental hospital. Once in the hospital, Omkar is given several shock treatments, which turn him into a vegetable. But Omkar recovers, and with the help of his girlfriend, Kiran Joshi, and inmates Subedar Bhuta Singh, Dr. Daniel, Pandit Radheyshyam Tiwari, and Poet Bekhabar Badnam, begins to plot to entrap and possibly kill the persons who were responsible for his present plight.
