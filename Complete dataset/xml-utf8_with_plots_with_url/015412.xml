<plot>Every year there is a national competition for student musicians. They are to perform a solo and are then given a rating from "poor" to "perfect." Those who receive a perfect consider themselves one of the lucky few in the nation and those who do not are left to leave in shame. A young musician aware of his talent arrives at the festival and before long he acquaints and makes a connection with a beautiful and attractive young rival. Will love be able to conquer pride and ego or is it destined to fall by the wayside of the harsh drudgery of competition?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015412</url></doc>
