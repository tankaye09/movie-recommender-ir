<plot>Riaa Bakshi lives a wealthy lifestyle in Hamburg, Germany, along with her widower dad. She gets hired as the Event Manager of touring Indian rock-star, Himesh Reshammiya, who comes to her rescue when she is being molested by an intruder. Both continue to meet, and eventually fall in love with each other. When her dad finds out, he cautions her, but she ignores him. Shortly thereafter, both father and daughter find out that Himesh has been arrested and has been charged with the murder of a TV Journalist, Nadia Merchant. Despite of this, Riaa believes that Himesh is innocent. Her belief gets shattered when Himesh breaks out of prison and allegedly kills Nadia's dad, Feroz, leaving her no choice but to agree to marry a man of her dad's choice.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020555</url></doc>
