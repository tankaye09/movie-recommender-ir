<plot>Mockumentary. Political Satire. Juaniyo is a janitor at the corrupt Mayor's mansion. The opulent comfort room that Juaniyo cleans has gold-plated fixtures with a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Each time the Mayor sits on his "throne"- the ground shakes, there is a thunder and earthquake in the community. One day Juaniyo is kidnapped by rebel soldiers who train him to become an assassin to end the Mayor's regime. Will the rebels succeed in turning Juaniyo into a hero or will all their efforts be flushed down the drain?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?116884</url></doc>
