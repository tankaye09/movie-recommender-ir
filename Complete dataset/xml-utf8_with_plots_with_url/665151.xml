<plot>Aware of the consequences of displeasing the Soviet censors, who had shelved his first two films, Vartanov documents one day in the life of postal workers in Armenia, even narrates for the first time. Tigran Mansurian, who had scored Paradjanov's Sayat Nova and worked with Vartanov on "The Color of Armenian Land" _Tsvet armyanskoy zemli (1969)_ (qv) and "Autumn Pastoral" _Osennyaya pastoral (1971)_ (qv), is again here. What would have certainly become a boring Soviet propaganda in the hands of most staff filmmakers at Armenfilm, became -- with Mansurian's simple score and Vartanov's charming voice-over and unobtrusive direction -- a rare and unusually frank document of ordinary working class people in Soviet Armenia.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?665151</url></doc>
