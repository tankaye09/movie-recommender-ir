<plot>Prabha lives a wealthy lifestyle with her widowed dad, Thakur Jasbir Singh and brother Kunwar Ranvir. She receives a marriage proposal from equally wealthy Thakur Shamsher Singh, but rejects him, gets married to Rajendra, re-locates to move-in with him and his widowed and principled mom, Amba Bhanupratap Singh, &amp; wayward brother Suraj, where she soon gives birth to Rajat. Rajendra, who secretly visits local courtesan, Munnibai, returns home intoxicated one night and sexually molests and then kills Geeta, who is their servant, Bhiku's daughter, but is treated like a family-member. Then when Amba returns home after watching Ram Leela, she apprehends Rajendra, has him arrested, he is eventually tried in Court, found guilty after Amba's testimony, and hanged. A devastated and humiliated Prabha swears to avenge his death, and leaves to live with her equally vengeful dad and brother, and together they plot to turn Amba and Suraj's lives upside down - so much so that Amba and Suraj not only lose their ancestral estate, their house is burned down, they are blacklisted by the community, where Amba is the Sarpanch, and to top it all up, Suraj is arrested for killing Shamsher and sexually molesting Prabha, and if found guilty will also be hanged like his brother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034102</url></doc>
