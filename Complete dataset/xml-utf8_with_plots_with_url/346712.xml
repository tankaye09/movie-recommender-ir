<plot>Henry Lamb sits listlessly on a curb. A sidewalk fortune teller with a telescope tells Henry he has a lucky star, and that if he follows it, he'll become a doctor, travel far, and meet a dark lady. Henry now has a purpose. With the wad of money he's saved, he boards a train, meets Dr. Healy, goes with Healy to the Mexican town of San Tabasco, and sees the lovely Mazda looking down on him from a balcony. Is everything just as his fortune foretold? Has he indeed followed his lucky star?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?346712</url></doc>
