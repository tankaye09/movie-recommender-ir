<plot>On a night that's 'different than all other nights,' two families join together on the brink of becoming one. Dave, a wealthy Jewish father who has absolutely no control over his teenage daughter Kia, takes his family to his girlfriend, Tiffany, for a Passover dinner. Tiffany, obsessed with perfection, struggles to create a Seder that accurately meets the traditions of Passover, which she is hopelessly unfamiliar with. The mishaps that follow tread the line of laugh out loud hilarious and tragically touching. The film opens with Kia, 16, peeing on a pregnancy test and encountering unwanted results. Meanwhile, Tiffany prepares for what she considers one of the most important dinners of her future marital life, spitting and spatting of the most unintelligible Hebrew terms. Miles, Tiffany's 8 year old son, is in his own world as he fumbles for flashlights in darkness and gathers food from the table to feed his "girlfriend" hiding in the garage. A woman who's "really skinny and clothes don't fit so good." The dinner is continuously interrupted by outbursts of veiled truths and severed relationships. When Trey, Kia's "Baby Papa" shows up to discuss the potential of his son, the possibility of a functional Passover is washed down the drain along with any attempt at concealing this information. Dave and Tiffany are oblivious to what is occurring right under their noses since they are preoccupied with the future of their own relationship and the implications of an unfortunate evening together. A story about disconnected relationships and the attempts of finding order in the jumbled essence of, well...life. Passed Over will make you think twice about the dysfunctions of your own family, while taking you on a comedic journey of acceptance, through the awkward and uninviting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425199</url></doc>
