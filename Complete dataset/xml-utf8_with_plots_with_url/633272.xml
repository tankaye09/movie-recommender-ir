<plot>What happens when a building slips through a crack in time? Leftover from an extinct era and useless in modern society, the Uptown Theatre has done just that. Closed in 1981, the 80-year old movie palace has sat in decay on Chicago's North Side, increasingly threatened by the savage enemies of real estate speculation and time itself. This film explores the history of the Uptown and why the biggest and arguably most elaborate movie theatre in the country has been left vacant for over twenty years. It uses interviews with 8=9 subjects close to the theatre combined with breathtaking footage of the palace itself to beg the viewer to question his or her values in modernity and what is really important in a society fueled by money and private interest. Is the Uptown a stoic remnant of the long-forgotten past, or is it, as Rapp &amp; Rapp remarked when they built it, a theatre 'not for today, but for all time'?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?633272</url></doc>
