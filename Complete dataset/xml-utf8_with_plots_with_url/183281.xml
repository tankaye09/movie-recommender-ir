<plot>Harold, unfulfilled by his friends, becomes obsessed with a woman named Eugenia Ma who is suspiciously absent throughout the film although utterly present through his monologues and dialogues with others.

Are we all searching for Eugenia Ma? Are we all in fact Eugenia Ma?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?183281</url></doc>
