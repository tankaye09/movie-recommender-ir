<plot>Blood: A Butcher's Tale, embodies the harrowing story of Sam, a simple yet effective butcher. He has mastered the art of slaughter and is considered a master craftsman at the meat processing plant. Sam is destined to follow the path of innate brutality, when he discovers the true reason why Darcy, the love of his life, is becoming emotionally disassociated. Out of desperation he follows her to a destination that will change the course for history forever. Sam is voyeur to a sensual encounter, between Darcy and a charismatic Casanova, with a fetish for finger foods. As he investigates further, Sam discovers what seems to be the final generation of existing vampires. In a painful attempt to reform his bloodlust infatuated fianc√©, he experiences a long overdue epiphany, vampirism is a disease and he is the cure. Sam's universe now spirals to a series of surreal episodes as he tracks down and disposes of the few remaining vampires. Finally he tracks down and prepares to dispatch the sole remaining survivor, Lily. An unwilling blood hunter, she, like Sam, is torn between living the everlasting romance of the undead and his moral obligation to cleanse. Helplessly, Sam falls in love Lily and learns to respect her desire to be human. Sam readjusts to his life, with his new found partner, and learns to live with the differences between the two races. But can Sam rest in the knowledge that he is riding the line between dead and not?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075710</url></doc>
