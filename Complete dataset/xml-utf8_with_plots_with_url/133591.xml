<plot>Dean Martin's smooth, seemingly effortless singing style was often imitated but never equaled. "The Colgate Comedy Hour" was the perfect showcase for the madcap antics of Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis in the 1950s, but a highlight of each show was when audiences got the chance to see and hear Dino singing his hits live. In this delightful collection, you too will get to see and hear Dino singing at his best on "The Colgate Comedy Hour" as well as some of his later classics in other rare live performances. No fan of popular music should be without DEAN MARTIN: EVERYBODY LOVES SOMEBODY SOMETIME.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?133591</url></doc>
