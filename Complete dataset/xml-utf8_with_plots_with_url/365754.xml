<plot>A very interesting scene is to watch the fishermen after their day's work, overhauling their seines to see if they need mending, so as to be ready for the next day's catch. Here we show them at work mending them, also giving an idea of their great size, showing them fully strung out. This scene is one that will be fully appreciated by any audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365754</url></doc>
