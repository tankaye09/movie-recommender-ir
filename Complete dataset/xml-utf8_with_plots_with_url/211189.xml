<plot>When Gee's drug suppliers get arrested doing a "run", he inherits a piece of the local action for himself. Realizing the opportunity to move up a rung, Gee takes it upon himself to position him and his partner Nas to new heights. Working for others always had it's limits, but as Gee soon finds out with responsibility comes new risks. Almost instantly they are pressured by aggressive competitors, bad customers and scarce product. As they traverse the cruel drug economy the outside world tends to become irrelevant, even futile. In a world where money, reputation and survival is important, Gee shows that self preservation can be undone from within.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?211189</url></doc>
