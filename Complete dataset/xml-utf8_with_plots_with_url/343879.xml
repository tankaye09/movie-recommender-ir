<plot>Towers Chandler saves a little out of his weekly pay from an architect's office and uses it to have a night on the town every few weeks. On one outing he meets a shop girl. When he boasts of his yachts and polo ponies she disdains his lack of a worthy purpose in life. The shop girl, though, is in reality the daughter of a tycoon. Her father decides to build a country house and employs the firm where Towers works. He brings the architectural plans to the tycoon's house and when the girl sees him meaningfully employed she realizes his does have a purpose in life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343879</url></doc>
