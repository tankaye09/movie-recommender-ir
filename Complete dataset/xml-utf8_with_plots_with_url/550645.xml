<plot>The scene is in a free and easy cafe. Young men and girls are sitting about chatting and drinking. In comes a typical Western cowboy, who proceeds to "shoot up" the place. He smashes most of the bric-a-brac and has everyone terror-stricken. He forces the bartender to stand on his head, and then insists upon one of the girls doing the same. The girl goes behind a screen and apparently obeys orders, for a couple of trim ankles are seen over the top of the screen. The cowboy thrusts the screen aside and is astonished to see the clever girl waving a couple of artificial stocking forms in the air, she giving him the laugh, and fortunately he appreciates the joke.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?550645</url></doc>
