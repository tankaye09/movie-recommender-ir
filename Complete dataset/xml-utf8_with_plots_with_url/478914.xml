<plot>Tough, gritty, and sensually enthralling, this cinematic slice of urban gang life explores the oft over-looked world of young, street-smart Latinas. Toro, a tough lesbian gang member, acclimates well to the group as they rob, steal, and hustle. The gang is strong--both sexually and physically--holding sacred both loyalty and the money it takes to survive. Despite the closeness of her gang and sisters, Toro feels isolated. Secrets from her past keep true friendships at bay and harden her already tough exterior. Yet Toro soon meets Michelle, a young mother who moves in with her abusive and cheating boyfriend, residing near where Toro spends time both keeping an eye on the neighborhood and trying to work through her anger. After discovering Michelle bruised and battered, Toro crosses the line of friendship by protecting and defending Michelle--accelerating the relationship beyond mere friendship. Yet their evolving relationship jeopardizes both their safety as the gang's suspicion is raised concerning their closeness. Trying to find peace within herself and hoping to eliminate the rage and hurt in her heart before it affects her budding relationship with Michelle, Toro struggles to leave gang life and break the cycle of violence before it is too late. SAVAGE ROSES is a breakthrough film--an old-fashioned, lesbian love story, humorously and poignantly told amidst the conflicts and moral ambiguity often found on the streets of New York City.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?478914</url></doc>
