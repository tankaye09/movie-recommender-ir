<plot>During Pink Floyd's "Momentary Lapse of Reason" tour in 1987-1988, a man named Bob Hickey was hired as a sound engineer to work the mixes during concerts. As a member of the road crew, he had access to the various members of Pink Floyd. PinkMovie.Com is an almost 2 hour documentary of the MLOR tour, compiled from hours and hours of footage, shot by Hickey and his fellow roadies during the tour.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433402</url></doc>
