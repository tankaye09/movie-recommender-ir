<plot>An omnibus featuring three Noel Coward tales, long on Coward humor which is to say very little at all, with the first, " The Red Peppers", featuring Kay Walsh, Ted Ray, Martita Hunt, Frank Pettingell and Bill Fraser, about a bickering vaudeville couple who form an alliance when some of theie company start to needle the, and ends up in some non-amusing slapstick. The second episode is "Fumed Oak" (with Stanley Holloway, Betty Ann Davies, Mary Merrall and Dorothy Gordon)is about a squabbling, middle-class family where Holloway has to contend with a ghastly mother-in-law, a selfish wife and a whining, complaining child and, after 17 years, tells each of them off and departs their company; the third segment is "Ways and Means" (with Valerie Hobson, Nigel Patrick, Jack Warner and Jessie Royce Landis) about a pair of parasite who go from city to city as non-paying guests of wealthy acquaintances. A wealthy American widow is trying to quietly kick them out of her French Rivera home, and the couple, needing funds to get to Venice, hatch a scheme to fleece her out of her gambling winnings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363653</url></doc>
