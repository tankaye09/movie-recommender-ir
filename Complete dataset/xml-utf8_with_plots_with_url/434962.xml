<plot>Two friends Jordan and Pricilla trying desperately to keep their relationship platonic. When their deeper love and attraction emerges - it explodes inside them. Thus - the "bomb". Jordan and Pricilla have been friends for years and have decided to share an apartment to keep rent low. While their relationship has never moved in a romantic direction in the past, they wind up in bed together the first night. They agree that it was a mistake and a moment of weakness that they can laugh about later. What follows is a series of evenings and outings as friends that couldn't possibly lead to sex and yet, somehow, every morning finds them in bed together. They are both desperate to keep their relationship platonic, but it never seems to work. Why does this keep happening? What is making them do this? The more they fight, the more the urge grows and maybe, just maybe, it's a fight they cannot win.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434962</url></doc>
