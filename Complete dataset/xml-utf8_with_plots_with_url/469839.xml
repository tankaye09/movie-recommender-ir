<plot>Shows Rube in the studio inspecting a fine piece of statuary, which on close examination looks like the real thing. After thoroughly inspecting it, he decides to embrace it, but as he reaches out his arms the statue disappears and is seen at the opposite side of the room. Rube makes a dive for it again, when the statue appears in its original place, and he finally makes another dive for the statue, just as his wife appears and discovers her liege lord about to embrace the figure. She makes a break for him and gives him a good thrashing. A very amusing subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469839</url></doc>
