<plot>No, this isn't a documentary about Huey Newton. It is the story of coal---or as much as can be told in seven minutes---and the Appalachian Valley, which held much of the supply. It tells of the men who mine the coal, the shipping and the mills and of a town where the coal company owned the streets, homes, stores, utilities and, unsaid but not needed, the miners themselves. Scary then and now as an unintended and unstated example of Big Brother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?073425</url></doc>
