<plot>As the news outlets warn of an impending terrorist plot on American soil, a lone security guard, Joe Stark, has become obsessed with preventing an attack. Well trained an disciplined, he has dedicated himself to protecting the public. Living an isolated life as a news junkie, Joe wants to be the hero to stop the terrorists. When Joe lands a new security job at a museum, he finds that he's the only one taking the warnings seriously. As his fears of this faceless threat mount, his over-zealous nature and paranoia spiral him headlong into destruction. He feels powerless against a foe that could strike at anytime, anywhere. The maddening pace of the media reports have driven Joe into an anxiety filled life where he is asked to constantly remain on alert. Joe must confront the reality that he is becoming his greatest fear, or die trying.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410443</url></doc>
