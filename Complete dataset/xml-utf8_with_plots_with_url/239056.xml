<plot>Starting from the premise that New Mexico holds a unique place in the annals of UFO history, journalist Anthony DellaFlora and documentary filmmaker James Lujan delve into the state's treasure trove of flying saucer lore. From centuries-old Native American myths and beliefs up to the present day preoccupation with the Roswell Incident, government conspiracy theories and the search for spiritual meaning in the skies. Along the way, they introduce viewers to a subculture populated by UFO enthusiasts, abductees, skeptics, cattle mutilation investigator and just plain folks who believe they've contact with extraterrestrials. Humorous, compelling and stripped of tabloid-TV sensationalism, "High Strange New Mexico" examines the cultural, economic and metaphysical factors behind the phenomenon and tells the extraordinary stories of ordinary people.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?239056</url></doc>
