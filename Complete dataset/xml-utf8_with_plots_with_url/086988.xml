<plot>When this picture bursts on to view a procession of wagons drawn by horses and mules is seen to move slowly down an avenue shaded by trees on both sides. The scene is laid in Havana, and presents the funeral cortege of the battleship Maine victims. Their coffins are plainly seen on the wagons which are followed by American and Spanish marines, and it is indeed a touching picture that in many cases draws tears. You will like this film and it will pay for itself many times over.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086988</url></doc>
