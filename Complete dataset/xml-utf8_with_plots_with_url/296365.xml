<plot>Fuzzy-Wuzzy is an aborigine, hunting kangaroos while riding an ostrich. He spots one, working out on a punching bag; after a bit of to and fro, he lands in the roo's pouch. The animal isn't too bright, and tries to evict the hunter with a stick of dynamite, which turns the kangaroo into a lot of tiny roos; they jump into the pouch and reassemble. The kangaroo pulls up the ostrich's head, which was buried in the sand; he cuts it off, and it becomes a firehose in his face. The hunter crosses a stream on his ostrich, which is eaten by a crocodile (a bit of violence, and the ostrich is freed). Finally, a flurry of boomerangs is repulsed by the kangaroo and they shave off Fuzzy Wuzzy's hair; after the hunter suggests the kangaroo "pick on someone his own size" they start shrinking, until they are the size of bugs and the ostrich eats both of them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?296365</url></doc>
