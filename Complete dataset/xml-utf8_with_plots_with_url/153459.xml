<plot>Doc and Champ run a travelling store, a wagon of goods which they pull into an Indian reservation, "Scalpum Village". They succeed in selling goods to the various Indians but one lovesick Indian requires female companionship... and will pay big money for it. Not one to pass up a quick buck, Doc decides to disguise Champ as a female Indian. At first, the Indian is unimpressed but Doc sprays him with a love potion and the smitten Indian madly gives chase. Champ, however, wants no part of romance and flees the Indian. Eventually, they crash into Doc's wagon culminating in a woman's dress and "Goldilocks" wig landing on Doc. The Indian, looking over the two, decides Doc is now the "woman" worth chasing after and chases him into the distance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153459</url></doc>
