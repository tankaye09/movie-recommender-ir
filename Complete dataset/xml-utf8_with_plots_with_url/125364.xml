<plot>This is a real novelty. A child beautifully clad is seen dancing around the moon. At times she disappears from view, but the moon continues to revolve and the pretty little dancer again appears, this time with her feet in the air, and slowly descends until she again dances before the audience as when she started. It will puzzle you to try to discover how this is done.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?125364</url></doc>
