<plot>Three girls from the Lisbon suburbs, Bruna, Marta and Sara, are having a bit of fun. They've discovered that people in general are prepared to give things to young, attractive and good-natured people, and they exploit this shamelessly. Francisco, a neighbour of theirs, has given up on life. He's abandoned his wife and child to take refuge far from  those who might hurt him ; in effect dying. He's ashamed of this, and never ever looks at anyone. This has given him, amongst the women of the neighbourhood, the reputation of being able to tell, just by looking at a couple, how long they'll stay together. The sudden news of the death of his much loved wife, upsets  Francisco's routine. This upset breaks through his shell and, for the first time in many years, his look encounters that of another person. The laughing eyes of Bruna. Bruna sees him and approaches him. This closeness, this curiosity of the girl for the solitary man arouse some pangs of conscience in him that end up by bringing him back into contact first with other people, and then with his son. This was not quite what Bruna wanted. Bruna wanted to get him for herself. But Francisco doesn't see her ; he receives what she offers and leaves. Francisco loses his fear. Bruna is left without anything.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126854</url></doc>
