<plot>Born with Tourette's Syndrome, Joel longs for acceptance but finds himself forced into seclusion as others are uncomfortable with his profanity-laced outbursts. Then, his life changes when he has a supernatural encounter with God who heals him of the neurological disorder. Everything goes great until God calls him to be a modern day prophet. Now, much to his dismay and those around him, Joel finds himself afflicted with something akin to spiritual Tourette's! Based on the verses Matthew 12:11-12 and made in 168 hours for the 168 Hour Film Project, it depicts a man wrestling with God's calling for his life. Only when Joel loses does he gain everything he has always wanted.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066834</url></doc>
