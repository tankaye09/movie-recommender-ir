<plot>A TV crew visits a primary school. The teacher asks Mary to tell the story of John the Baptist as the crew films. John calls on folk to "give up yer aul sins." One woman refuses. John gets tossed in jail and begins to have doubts, so he asks a passer-by to find Jesus and ask if he really is God. Jesus, fishing in the sea, assures the man that He is. So the passer-by returns to the jail to give John courage. Meanwhile, the king is invited to a party, takes with him the woman John has earlier confronted, asks her to dance for him, and is so impressed he offers her anything she wants. Mary's colorful narrative, John's head, and the crew's spool of film near their end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?216473</url></doc>
