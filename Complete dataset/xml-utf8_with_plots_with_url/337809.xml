<plot>This is a very amusing story in three scenes. Scene 1. -- Algy purchases a large stock of fireworks at the store. Scene 2. -- Algy places his stock of fireworks on the ground and lights a cannon firecracker. It explodes the entire lot and there is a grand mix up of Algy and the fireworks. Scene 3. -- Algy is in bed attended by his mother and family physician. He is swathed in bandages from head to foot.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?337809</url></doc>
