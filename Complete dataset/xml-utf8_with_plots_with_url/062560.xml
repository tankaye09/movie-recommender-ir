<plot>This is a very funny picture. It begins by showing the beautiful girl who won the prize at the Beauty Show. A sign suspended from her neck tells the audience that she is the winner of the first prize. The second and third prizes are then shown, and the fourth damsel bears a sign explaining that she was highly recommended. Then comes the "Consolation" prize, which causes the audience to screech with laughter. An aged and quite stout Irish woman is the recipient of honors, and her facial expressions are the limit as she bows her acknowledgments of the favor bestowed upon her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062560</url></doc>
