<plot>"A magnificent picture, taken aboard H.M.S. 'Repulse' during the annual manoeuvres of the British Channel fleet. At the opening of the picture a sailor is seen painting a barbette. While he is at work a ten-inch gun is swung in such a position as to throw him from his perch into the sea. It is evident in an instant that he is unable to swim. Life-buoys are thrown in to the water, and several seamen dive from the deck of the vessel. A life boat is quickly lowered from the davits, and the man is rescued. In the background of the picture appear two of the most formidable battleships of the British navy. The negative is very fine photographically."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?355195</url></doc>
