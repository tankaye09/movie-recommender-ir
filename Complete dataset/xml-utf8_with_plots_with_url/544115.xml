<plot>The Birdman arrives in NYC with his dreams, and his show, in his suitcase. In an Off-Off Broadway theater where he will perform for one night, he encounters the big eyes, large breasts and feathered hats of the young woman who works in the box office. The ticket sales for his show are meager, but now, there is only one woman he hopes to impress. And suddenly, only her laughter can make him a success.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?544115</url></doc>
