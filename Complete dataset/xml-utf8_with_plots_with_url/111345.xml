<plot>A comatose woman in a very dismal hospital has been completely conscious of her surroundings for the entire 7 years and 1 day she has been in a coma. Now her only connection to life - the one kind nurse in the hospital - is leaving for a new job. Out of her desperation, Comagirl screams out telepathically as the nurse leaves. But the nurse doesn't believe her ears, and leaves. The janitor enters. He is a good man - perhaps even a Christian. Comagirl starts "speaking" to him. He offers to get a doctor, but she explains that the doctors have done nothing for her for 7 years. She makes it very clear that she doesn't need a doctor - she needs healing. He thinks what she's asking for is wrong, but what can he do?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?111345</url></doc>
