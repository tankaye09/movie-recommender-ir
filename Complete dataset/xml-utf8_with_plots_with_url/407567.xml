<plot>Imagine nearly a mile of braided steel cable, weighing in at just under one million pounds. Visualize this weight anchored onto a freestanding platform three stories tall- a platform which couldn't be allowed to transmit vibrations to an adjacent micro-surgery clinic. A platform that was designed to look as light as air itself. Building a mass-transit system within these confines, while maintaining a world-class design aesthetic seemed like an impossible task. However, the Portland Aerial Tram is just such a singularly unique architectural and engineering marvel. Through interviews with the city's project manager, an architecture critic, the former mayor of Portland, and the head of the design competition committee a unique view into the challenges faced by all parties in this project. The overall design concept of the tram itself is carried forward throughout the film with breathtaking footage captured from off-limits vantage points that few have had the chance to see. The progressive transportation and urban planning philosophies of Portland Oregon are brought to life in this iconic structure, and highlighted in this unique film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407567</url></doc>
