<plot>'Bama Girl follows a charismatic black woman's quest to become the 2005 Homecoming Queen at the University of Alabama, one of the great Deep South institutions. Homecoming has a rich history there, tied into centuries of privilege, old money, and racial exclusivity. We follow Jessica Thomas' campaign for Queen, running against not only 15 other co-eds, but a strictly segregated Greek system, internal black politics, and, most ominously, a secret all-white association called 'The Machine' that has been controlling politics at the University for most of the past century. This is a film about the light and the dark sides of tradition - and a fascinating parable for the electoral politics that affect our country everyday.</plot><plot>'Bama Girl follows a charismatic black woman's quest to become the 2005 Homecoming Queen at the University of Alabama, one of the great Deep South institutions.
