<plot>Ever since 9/11 the world has changed. It has changed for Americans more so than anyone else. But what if you are an All-American, but look middle-eastern to the general population. Imagine the feeling you have when walking onto to a plane with a full beard. That is an interesting stimulus that churns one's brain as a writer. Now mix that with being an American, who looks middle-eastern, and was raised on comedies like "Airplane!" and "Spaceballs". That has to have an interesting outcome. One of those outcomes is "Terrorist TV."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536295</url></doc>
