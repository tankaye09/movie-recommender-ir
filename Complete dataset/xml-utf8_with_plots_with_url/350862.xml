<plot>While working for the mob, Bill "The Mouth" Mannuci, stole $12 million dollars from them and turned over information to the FBI about the man he stole the money from, the mysterious "Skipper". Now 4 of the "Skipper's" men have tracked down Bill to his new home in a small country town. Bill has been warned of this and sends his wife Debra away. Captured by the "Skipper's" men, Bill is forced at gunpoint to take them to the missing $12 million. But as they make their way to the money, Bill escapes and the "Skipper's" men end up chasing him into a backwoods crystal-meth lab, where a gunbattle ensues after on of the "Skipper's" men opens fire. As Bill makes his escape the lab burns to the ground, incurring the wrath of the labs owner, who is owed money by Bill. Soon Bill finds himself being chased by not only the "Skipper's" men, but by the crystal-meth lab owner and his men. And how does the sheriff of the town fit into the equation?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350862</url></doc>
