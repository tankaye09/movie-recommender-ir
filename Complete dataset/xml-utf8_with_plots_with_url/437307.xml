<plot>Poker is not just a game, it's a Philosophy! What happens when Borut, a modern-day anti-hero with no respect for rules, gets mixed up in it? Duro was sent to find out where his boss's missing money has got to, Matjaz is in the game so as to be near his love, Aljosa is trying to find himself in poker. Vesna, the dealer, tries to satisfy everyone, herself included, in this dangerous game... Consequently Borut gets tangled up in a cruel game for life, in a crime drama full of twist and bloody score-settling, in which it would be difficult to find a winner. Poker tells the truth about life, not just about death written in the cards.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?437307</url></doc>
