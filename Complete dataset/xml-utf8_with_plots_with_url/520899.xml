<plot>Schmitty is in a rut. His last car died on him, he hates his job, his girlfriend left him, and he spends his weekends drinking himself into oblivion. Then one night, his buddy Jim suggests they attend their pal Guy's cocktail party at a sprawling house in the country with nothing for miles around..except an abandoned cemetery up the road. Guy's invited everyone he knows--about 8 or 9 dudes. With no alternative but to consume brain-deadening quantities of alcohol, Jim, Schmitty, and Guy drink themselves to sleep. Morning comes, and with it a crushing headache, as well as a straggler from last night's party, the irritable Mixon, who demands a ride home, and NOW. It's just as the boys discover the power is out and all phone lines are dead that they are attacked by a drooling, crazed man who bites a chunk out of Jim before being beaten and locked in a closet - and he isn't content to stay there. Knowing that with no contact with the outside world Jim is in serious trouble, Guy drives him to town, leaving Schmitty and Mixon to guard their captive until Guy comes back with the police. The problem is, Schmitty and Mixon may have more company than they realize.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520899</url></doc>
