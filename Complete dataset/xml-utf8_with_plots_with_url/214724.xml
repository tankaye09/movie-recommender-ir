<plot>Gift was shot in the notorious post-industrial lunar landscape of the Wolfen-Bitterfeld district of former East Germany, where composer Ulf Langheinrich was born. The area is famous as a great environmental disaster, a product of uncurbed open-cast mining and chemical production. Although the devastation belongs to a past era of massive state industry, some coal mining continues, using vast mobile diggers built in the 1930s. This object lesson in environmental vandalism, is now an eco-tourist attraction, reflecting the tensions between the old East Germany and the new, post-unification Germany. The hypnotic electronic music is constructed and mixed from the industrial sounds recorded on location.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214724</url></doc>
