<plot>My father's garden is the story of a 28 year old woman who has never met her father. She learns that he is dying in a small hospital just outside a tiny village in the South West of France, and would like to meet her before he dies. A house has been rented for her, by no-one knows who, in the middle of the French countryside where she expects to be completely alone so she can prepare to confront her father. But shortly after her arrival, she discovers that she is not alone. We find two extremely strange characters roaming about the house and garden. Anxiety takes hold- are they real? Or creations of her own anguished psyche? She realizes that she must simply go and confront her father for the first time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383785</url></doc>
