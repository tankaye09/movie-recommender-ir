<plot>This is the name of the most famous marching club in the United States, regardless of the party, and is justly considered the finest; and we wish to say that we have the finest and best and only picture in existence of this great body of well-drilled men; great picture to create enthusiasm among Democrats, and bound to please Republicans, owing to the fact that it is a picture of a perfectly drilled body of men lead by the well-known Capt. James Farrell.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115030</url></doc>
