<plot>When Boston director Daniel Akiba's brother Jonah traveled to Israel, his mother's parting words to her son were, "Have a good time, but whatever you do, don't become Orthodox." Three months later Jonah called his mother and said, "The Torah is the word of G-d." After his brother's radical conversion, Akiba found it increasingly difficult to remember the brother he once knew. In an effort to better understand his brother's new life, Akiba documented his family's trip to Israel in 2001, 7 years after Jonah's arrival in Israel and subsequent conversion, to attend Jonah's wedding. Along the way he explores a foreign world and how his brother's embrace of Orthodox Judaism has affected them all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383482</url></doc>
