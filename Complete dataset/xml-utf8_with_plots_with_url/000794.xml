<plot>Polly the goldfish and her owner Mr. Larkin lead what could only be described as a fascinating life. Day in, day out, they wake up, eat, reflect on lost memories and go back to sleep. The two share a deep bond; a liking for routine, a fear of the world outside their homes, and on Saturdays: cornflakes. On an ordinary day, when they both thought the biggest excitement would be breakfast, something is falling towards them. Today, by coincidence the anniversary of the moon landing, a bizarre visitor will be forced upon them. It will be a small step for mankind, but a giant leap for Mr. Larkin...</plot><plot>Polly the goldfish and her owner Mr. Larkin lead what could only be described as a fascinating life.
