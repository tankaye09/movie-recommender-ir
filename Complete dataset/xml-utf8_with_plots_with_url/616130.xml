<plot>Dr. Ralph Metzner is one of the classic figures in the history of modern consciousness research and transpersonal psychology. In this "Transpersonal Conversation" Dr. Metzner talks about his work as a modern-day Shaman, psychotherapist and psychedelic drug advocate, among other topics. As a pioneer of consciousness research he co-wrote The Psychedelic Experience (with Leary and Alpert) and was editor of The Psychedelic Review. He served as the Academic Dean at the California Institute of Integral Studies for more than ten years and is still a Professor there, teaching courses on "Altered States of Consciousness" and "Developing Ecological Consciousness." He is a popular author and sought-after speaker. His many books and publications include: The Well of Remembrance, The Unfolding Self and Green Psychology.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?616130</url></doc>
