<plot>The beautiful Angelina has been jilted by her bridegroom, Edwin, who does not want to settle down to married life and be committed to one woman only. Angelina, wearing her full wedding regalia (and accompanied by her bridesmaids), takes Edwin to Court in order to get compensation - and all the members of the all-male jury fall madly in love with her. They are against the Defendant from the start - even though they openly admit that they behaved exactly the same as he did when they, themselves, were young lads!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?617763</url></doc>
