<plot>TakaPu, a computer-animated gannet, travels around the Pacific islands and tells about his incredible adventures and exciting encounters with the islanders and diverse cultures of the Pacific. TakaPu is the Maori name for gannet. He is cheeky and precocious, like all young gannets, and, of course, outrageously clumsy. He is driven by his never ending appetite for man made fishfingers and will beg, steal and borrow to get them. The series is aimed at pre-school and primary school kids. In a lightly educational, but nevertheless entertaining and funny way it helps to promote a better understanding of Pacific cultures amongst children of all descents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529053</url></doc>
