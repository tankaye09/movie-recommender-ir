<plot>This is a tremendously good comedy scene. The camera fiend arranges a family group--father, mother, daughter, and small boy. He sets off a tremendous flash light and his whole can explodes. The house is completely wrecked, torn to pieces, and the family is with difficulty collected and identified by the policeman and by-passer who rush in. One of the best comedy films produced in a long time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547183</url></doc>
