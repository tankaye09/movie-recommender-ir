<plot>The story of Joe Lazaro, 27, who after a tour in Vietnam, reads meters for Brooklyn/Queens Water Resources and suspects that his nickname, Joe the Engineer, barely sets him apart from the other Joe's in his neighborhood. As historical structures break down and the restrictive environment in which he lives increasingly fails to sustain him, Joe finds himself a blue-collar exile in his own country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?278057</url></doc>
