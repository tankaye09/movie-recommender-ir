<plot>BOUND BY BLOOD follows the lives of three men, bound by family, who are split apart by tragedy. Trevor Thomas is the rebellious kickboxer and childhood friend of Johnny Choi. He is married to Johnny's sister, Lauren, and the two are expecting their first child. Johnny is an undercover narcotics officer who always follows the letter of the law, while his father, Master Young Choi, is the die-hard traditionalist who taught both men martial arts from a young age. After a drug bust goes awry, the syndicate, fronted by a mysterious man known only as "The Voice," tracks down Johnny and his family. In one heartbreaking instant, his pregnant sister Lauren and father Master Choi are both shot. The baby is lost immediately while Master Choi, severely wounded, lies in a coma. Trevor, out of frustration and emotion, blames his brother-in-law for the tragedy and the two become torn apart. They each set out on different paths in search of their own justice. Johnny relies on his years of police training, while Trevor, the vigilante, searches for answers via the streets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080662</url></doc>
