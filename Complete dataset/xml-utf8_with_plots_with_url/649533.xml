<plot>An exploration of the Downtown New York art, music and performance scenes from the mid 1970s to present day. "Wednesdays at A's" is a feature documentary about noted underground artist Arleen Schloss who was present at the beginning of many new art movements, including Fluxus, performance art, sound poetry, video art, film and digital art. Known as an "artists' artist", Schloss became influential through her space A's Salon. A's turned into a pioneering place, becoming a hub for music, exhibitions, performances, and films, rivaling clubs like the Mudd Club and CBGB's. During the late 1970s and early 80s, hundreds of people showed work or performed at A's, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Eric Bogosian, Glenn Branca, ManiaD, Elodie Lauten, Phoebe Legere, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Kim Gordon, Richard Edson and Alan Vega. Through exclusive never before seen archival footage shot by Schloss herself, mixed with interviews with people from the scene, we trace her life story and see - from her point of view- how New York City and the overall art world developed from the 1970s to present day.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649533</url></doc>
