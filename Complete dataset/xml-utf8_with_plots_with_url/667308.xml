<plot>"If you adults won't do something about global climate change, then we kids are going to take the reins." Shannon McComb In Young Voices on Climate, we see children stepping out on their own and taking action to reduce the carbon footprint of their homes, schools, towns and even their states. As in the hero's journey, they are often overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles and prevailing-stopping school bus idling statewide, banning plastic bags, doing scientific climate research and raising awareness. The kids speak directly about their concerns, their knowledge, and their actions to combat climate change. They have the potential to galvanize the public-adults and kids alike-- and create a sea change in the way that societies view, and act to abate, global warming.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667308</url></doc>
