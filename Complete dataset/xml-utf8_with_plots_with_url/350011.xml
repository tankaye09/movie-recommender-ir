<plot>Macau, this small Portuguese colony situated in the far reaches of Asia, was once home to all those excluded from the world. A hideout for smugglers, a niche for crooks of mixed blood. It is a legendary city serving all fantasies, a paradise for the debauched, an eerie gambling club, the poetic power of which has given birth to many a story. A charming documentary mixing poetic images of this special place nowadays with footage from the old days, accompanied by a poem written by Antoine Volodine.
