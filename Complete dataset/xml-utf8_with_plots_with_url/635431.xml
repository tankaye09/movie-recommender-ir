<plot>Rich with the beauty and magic of Richard Wagner's music, VALHALLA is the humorous and touching tale of three estranged brothers who present their unique rendition of Wagner's entire 18 hour opera THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG in their living room for their ailing father. Disappointed when a heart attack prevents him from fulfilling his lifelong dream of traveling to Bayreuth, Germany to see his beloved opera, his three sons put aside their differences and get to work. Starting with a minimum of props and performers, they gradually gather about them an unlikely group of characters, including a Puccini loving biker, his two girlfriends, and a surfer dude just muscle bound enough to play Siegfried. This odd gathering of characters eventually lip-synch the dragons, goblins and gods to life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?635431</url></doc>
