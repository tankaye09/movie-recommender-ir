<plot>From his log cabin in Montana, Rich Hall writes to his friend Mike Wilmot to come and share with him in lively, face-to-face debate, far from the distractions of television, computers and mobile phones. Together the pair aim to form a small free-thinking society, discuss the upcoming election and "drink a sh*tload of bourbon. With Mike being Canadian, he has little or no knowledge of American politics so Rich takes the opportunity to introduce him to how the whole system works; of course it is much more likely to just become a series of drunken rants.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?174852</url></doc>
