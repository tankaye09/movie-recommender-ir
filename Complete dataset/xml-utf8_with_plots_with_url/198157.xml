<plot>The series consists of a 10 x 60' observational documentary series taking two larger-than-life British families to the Pritikin Longevity Center and Spa in Aventura, Florida to follow a two-week Pritikin Family Weight Loss Programme. Florida Fatbusters follows their daily development as they prepare to leave for Florida, sweat it out at the Center, and stun friends on their return. Surrounded by palm trees, clear blue skies and a shimmering sunset, they join twenty American families who are all trying to make a break with the past and put fat firmly behind the family lineage. Followed by a swarm of doctors, dieticians, child and family psychologists and exercise physiologists, the expectations and objectives of all the family members are exposed which at times proves for the revelation of some uncomfortable truths. With varying emotions bordering on anger, guilt and shame, Florida Fatbusters carries a lot of emotional baggage as well as real pounds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?198157</url></doc>
