<plot>The entire totalitarian 20th century is reflected in the life of Erwin Joeris, 90-year-old worker from Berlin. As a child, he experienced the funeral procession of Rosa Luxemburg, as a young communist he fought against Nazism and landed in the Sonenburg concentration camp. In Stalinist Moscow he drew the attention of the secret police, who turned him over to the Gestapo. And, for a German soldier, the Russian campaign meant being a prisoner of war. In East Berlin the Soviet secret police arrested him again and sentenced him to 25 years in the Workuta labor camp, a Gulag mining camp in west Siberia. He was released in 1956 and has since lived in Cologne.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?672995</url></doc>
