<plot>CHILDHOOD'S END is a short autobiographical self-examination, exploring "who I am" by reflecting on a range of childhood memories and emotions. Guided by the topics of loss, death, and nostalgia, CHILDHOOD'S END acts as a form of therapeutic analysis, probing the darker side of childhood innocence and the loss thereof. The film is also an experiment in the materiality of film, juxtaposing hand-coloured Super8 footage with highly pixelated digital media. The dichotomy of old and new helps articulate the dying relationship between time and space, blurring the line between the past and the present, as well as reality and the make-believe. The non-linear narrative is an eclectic mix of events, people, objects, and emotions melted together in a tenuous journey of salvation and restoration. In search of understanding my own inherent values and virtues, CHILDHOOD'S END is a social, ethnographical, exploration of adulthood and the human spirit.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?103103</url></doc>
