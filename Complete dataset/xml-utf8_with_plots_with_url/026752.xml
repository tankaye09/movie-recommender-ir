<plot>In 1987 Dublin was the focus of the world music scene. U2 were huge. Music scouts flocked to Ireland in their quest to find the next big thing. They didn't bargain on finding Aidan Walsh - comedian, entrepreneur and self-proclaimed master of the universe! Aidan Walsh first came to the nation's attention when he signed the quickest record deal in pop music history. All it took was a three-minute rendition of the Hokey Cokey.
