<plot>Actress Renee' Wilson's (Ray) life is forever changed when she returns home to the devastation and desolation of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and must cope with the effects the aftermath has on her and her family as well as the ghosts from her past. Wilson's feature documentary is a personal narrative - it is both a chronicle of the powerful forces that are shaping the city's altered landscape, and an intimate memoir of the changes her family has endured and the adjustments they have been forced to make. It is a story of love, loss and rebirth - a journey through the eyes of an insider, going home after the storm.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?118444</url></doc>
