<plot>Covering eight years of time in Washington, DC, indie filmmaker RJ Lofgren tells the story of several rising musicians who are nobodies in the big picture of the world of music, but talented enough to rise out of obscurity and into the world of the known. Following the filmmaker's acceptance into the music scene of Washington, DC as a passionate listener, he links his decade of life in our nation's capital with Ira Gonzalez, Will Rast, and Alfonso Velez, among others, who carve out existences as working musicians. From composition to performance, their music is original and solid, though not fully appreciated. Lofgren sets out to change this with a camera and a microphone, and his passion and love of live music. If you are nobody, somebody knows.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?399242</url></doc>
