<plot>When your bike gets ripped off for the second time in a month, you may find yourself wondering about the thieves and where they take the bikes. The week after this happened to East Vancouver filmmaker Aren Hansen, he began to make this film. Riding a stolen blue bicycle through the city, he goes on a journey to seek out people with similar experiences, to demystify bike thieves and to explore his fears, memories and many shades of anger. White Vans is a stylish docudrama with reenactments, a bait bike and awesome Canadian music from Caribou, Pink Mountaintops and others.
