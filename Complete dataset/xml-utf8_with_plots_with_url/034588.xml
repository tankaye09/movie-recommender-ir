<plot>Long-running as a radio program, this debate show made its television debut in 1948. The format was fairly simple: prominent persons, including politicians, writers, scientists and other experts, would come and debate various issues of the day. Subjects frequently were controversial, challenging popular opinion on subjects like the supposed spread of Communism, or the country's involvement in overseas wars.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034588</url></doc>
