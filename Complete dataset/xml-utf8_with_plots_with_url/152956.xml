<plot>Wealthy Sharda is in love with poor Vinod Kumar and would like to marry him. But her gangster brother, Vishwanath Dayaram refuses to permit her, as he would like her to marry Nano, a garage owner and fellow-gangster, with whom he already has arranged her marriage. So Vishwanath gets Vinod killed, and Sharda, who is pregnant, runs away and gives birth to a baby boy, from whom she unfortunately separates. Vishwanath has sent his men to kill Sharda and her child at any cost, but she continues to elude them. Twenty years later Sharda does meet her brother - who is just on the verge of killing Sagar - who is none other than her estranged son.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?152956</url></doc>
