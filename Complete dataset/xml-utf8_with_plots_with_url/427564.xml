<plot>Just teetering south of puberty, young Thomas Harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars, he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door. While 'studying', he is busted by his mother and begs her not to tell his dad. At dinner, his father asks him about his new telescope. Thomas narrowly escapes when his brother Sean finds a wishbone, and suggests that they make a wish. Reaching to break the wishbone, Thomas thinks of his ultimate dream - to see the sexy neighbor naked. Thomas' wish comes true and he stays up all night watching her. He pays the price for his sleepless night, however, the next morning when his father awakens him into a whole Nude World. To confirm his worst fears, Thomas sprints outside and discovers that it is not just a terrible dream - his vision may never be the same.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?427564</url></doc>
