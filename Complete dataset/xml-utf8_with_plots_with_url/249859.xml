<plot>Anand Mathur, a middle-class Bombay businessman, has no end of trouble trying to deal with his five wild daughters. There's Meenaxi, the eldest, a vengeful feminist ever ready with her rolling pin; Radhika, an intelligent but hearing/visually-impaired girl who often consequently causes misunderstandings; Sweety, a man-hungry twit who dreams of marrying Shah Rukh Khan (and for that matter any handsome man she sees); Kajal, a don with a foot in key Bombay underworld (dangerous) activities; and finally Choti, a pudgy teenager with a tongue for both food and gossip. His wife doesn't help either - overweight Bina Mathur always takes the side of her children, and takes every available opportunity to henpeck him. In the midst of this fray, there is the ghost of his first wife, the mother to his first three daughters (whom only Anand can see and communicate with), who always get her two caustic cents in every situation. With all this, it's a wonder Anand can survive each and every day, for all five of his children, get up to some schemes, shenanigans, etc. that never fails to create pandemonium in Bombay!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249859</url></doc>
