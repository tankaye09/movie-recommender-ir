<plot>Len is a young ventriloquist; Hugo is his dummy. Len dreams of a career in magic, but as his career has grown so has his dependency on Hugo as surrogate friend. Len is forced to make a choice of following his dreams in the world of illusion at the expense of finding his true self. 'Len and Hugo' is a poignant comedy about a peculiar friendship and complexities growing up.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?329142</url></doc>
