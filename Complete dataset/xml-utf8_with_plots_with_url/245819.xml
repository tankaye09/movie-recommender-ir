<plot>Did you ever wish that you could have actually been on the set of one of your favorite horror films? To have been right there where it all went down? Well in some cases you can, and that is what Horror's Hallowed Grounds is all about. I will pick a classic horror or cult film and do a full retrospective on the film while visiting all of actual filming locations as they appear today. I will also take some of the film's stars or filmmakers along to talk about what it was like to make these classic films. This has been a personal hobby of mine for over a decade, and I have traveled all over the world in search of actual filming locations from my favorite films. Now I'm ready to share them with you on Horror's Hallowed Grounds.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245819</url></doc>
