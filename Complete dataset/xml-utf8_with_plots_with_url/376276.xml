<plot>After the fourth tenant has been murdered on his ranch, Dave Borden (Johnny Mack Brown) is accused of the slayings but cleared. A neighboring rancher is also murdered by a mysterious masked rider, and his daughter Sally Wilson (Virginia Herrick) inherits his ranch. Shortly afterwards, rancher Jim Berry (Edmund Cobb) and his foreman, Hal Jackson (Marshall Reed) approach Dave about buying his property, and Jackson and Dave get into a fight. Later, when Jackson is shot from ambush, Dave is under suspicion again. He now sets out to find out what is behind all of the killings and who the masked rider might be.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376276</url></doc>
