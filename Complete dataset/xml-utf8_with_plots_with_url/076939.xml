<plot>BnE follows Milk, a young "Break n Enter" artist through the back yards and alleyways of the sleeping city. He's all about busting in and getting out with as much as possible except where Donette is concerned. He'd like nothing better than to be with her and be a father to her son, but she's got her own plans. Milk's other main concerns are keeping up with his life of theft and dealing with Natalie, the disarmingly beautiful 14-year old jail bait daughter of his landlord. When an ill-fated break in goes tragically wrong and he is caught in a compromised position with Natalie Milk learns the life he's living comes with a heavy price.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076939</url></doc>
