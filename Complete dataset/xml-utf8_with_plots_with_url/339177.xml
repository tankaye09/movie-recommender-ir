<plot>This film follows the roller coaster life of a sideshow performer and half- man. He was born one stormy night in Baltimore, Md. and was the second child of twins. The year was 1911. He had no legs, but all the drive to conquer the world. He went on to become an accomplished actor, artist, magician, musician, photographer as well as one of the most famous sideshow performers of the last century. Robert Ripley hired him, Tom Waits sings about him and David Blaine references Him in his book.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?339177</url></doc>
