<plot>The mysteriously ill John Braun (Fred Niblo) makes a new will, leaving out his daughter Barbara (Marsha Hunt), over the protests of his wife (Ann Shoemaker). The trouble began when the daughter wanted to marry Mr. Braun's doctor, James Rogers (Michael Whalen). Mrs. Braun asks Inspector Queen to help find the long-missing Barbara. The inspector's son, Ellery (Ralph Bellamy), works on the case. He goes to a home frequently visited by Dr. Rogers where the bell is answered by Nikki Porter (Margaret Lindsay) who Ellery mistakes for Barbara and insists she return to the Braun home. Nikki does, to protect Barbara, and a short time later finds herself alone in a room outside Braun's bedroom. She finds him dead - his throat cut. No weapons are found and the door to the room where Nikki had been is locked, and she is suspected. Ellery hides Nikki in his apartment. Braun's body, sent for an autopsy, disappears and in its place is a life-sized statue of the dead man. Elley finds the body in a closet, the police prepare to send it downtown but someone drives off with the ambulance. Ellery, with Nikki, visits Braun's bedroom that night and discovers that a pet raven flies in and out taking items.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175661</url></doc>
