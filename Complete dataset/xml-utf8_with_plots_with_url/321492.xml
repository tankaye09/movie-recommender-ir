<plot>While working, the young barkeeper Tom meets the activist couple Dennis and Mia. He spontaneously quits his job and joins the two of them. In their apartment, he experiences their rebellious attitude towards life and becomes interested in their cause. Their ideas are simple and convincing and are being spread through creative street-protests. Besides becoming aware that things don't have to stay the way they always have been, another feeling awakens in Tom. He feels fatally attracted to Mia, whose erotic promises raises his hopes. Anything seems possible. All of a sudden, Tom and Dennis have become rivals. The threesome and it's beliefs start to crumble. The next day Tom joins in to the protest at the train station. The campaign works out well, until Dennis is feeling disregarded and blows a fuse. The police shows up and savagely ends the protest. There is total confusion and everyone quickly has to decide who to stick to.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321492</url></doc>
