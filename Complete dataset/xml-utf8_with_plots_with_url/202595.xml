<plot>An Austrian farmer and father of four, Franz Jaegerstaetter had to make a terrible choice: to serve in Hitler's army or to face execution. A devout Catholic and loving husband and father, Franz struggled with his responsibilities to his family, and to state authority, but in the end felt he could not betray God and his faith by serving the Third Reich. He was executed on August 9, 1943, at the age of 36. Simple yet powerful this documentary explores the recently beatified martyr's life and death, and its meaning for today. Franz's letters from prison are read by Martin Sheen.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202595</url></doc>
