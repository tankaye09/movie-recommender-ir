<plot>The mission: Capture U.S. and NATO forces on camera giving food, water, clothing, blankets, and medical supplies to widows and orphans in refugee camps and villages. Most of the relief aid comes from a grassroots effort in America during the past five years by a courageous Air Force intelligence officer, Col. Victor Kuchar, who is the highest ranking officer to regularly travel into the tribal regions. Col. Kuchar, a Catholic from a small Michigan parish, has captured the hearts and minds of the youngsters, as well as the respect of the elders, mostly Pashtun, or Sunni Muslims, who call him "Mullah" (a local leader). The interaction between U.S. Forces and these forgotten family members of fighters killed or maimed helping drive out the Taliban, post 9/11, and who continue at our side in the war on terror against Al-Qaeda and other Muslim extremist groups, is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. No international aid organizations dare venture "Outside the Wire" of Bagram Forward Operating Base and into these regions. It's too dangerous. The filmmakers strive to bring awareness to the plight of thousands of men, women and children living at what soldiers and airman call "The end of the world."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?418630</url></doc>
