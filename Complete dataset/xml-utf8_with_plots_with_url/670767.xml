<plot>Hung Ping is a "ghostbuster", vampire buster and scientist in early 20th century China. He's a very talented wizard but there's not much call for people in his line of work. He shares his home with his extremely jealous wife, a successful and talented fortune teller, plus his dim-witted son and assistant Ming, his beautiful and talented daughter Fa, and their Ghost Servant. The story resolves around Hung Ping's efforts to capture and control "the Copper Vampire", a bloodthirsty demon on the rampage. Unfortunately, the bloodthirsty demon brings back luck to whoever holds him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670767</url></doc>
