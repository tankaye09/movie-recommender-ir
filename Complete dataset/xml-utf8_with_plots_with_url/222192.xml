<plot>In a small room a man kneels down to pray in front of a framed painting of Jesus. The picture is garish and kitschy. His prayers are soon interrupted by a noisy fly, which seems intent on landing on his hands. After several futile attempts to wave the fly away, the man leaves the room and the fly settles on the painting. The man bursts back into the room and swats the fly with a rolled-up newspaper. The carcass of the fly leaves a smudge on Jesus' cheek: it looks like a tear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222192</url></doc>
