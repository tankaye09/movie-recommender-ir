<plot>Revival of the popular 1974-1978 game show and again hosted by Bert Convy. 3 celebrity couples competed each playing for 1/3 of the studio audience separated into blue, yellow (banana) and red rooting sections. The husbands/wives were taken offstage while their wives/husbands were asked a question; matching answers won a share of $150 for their rooting section of the audience. Midway through the Show, the husbands and wives traded places to play the game as before. After the 4th &amp; Last Question worth $300, the couple(s) with the most money won a share of the $1000 bonus.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?532131</url></doc>
