<plot>A woman on the run finds shelter in a rooming house whose boyish caretaker shows her unexpected kindness as he struggles to contain feelings she stirs in him. When two cops arrive with the news that her husband has vanished, she becomes a murder suspect, but one of the cops, apparently smitten, offers her a way out. To accept his help, she'll have to buy his claim that the sweet, young caretaker is not what he seems.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062156</url></doc>
