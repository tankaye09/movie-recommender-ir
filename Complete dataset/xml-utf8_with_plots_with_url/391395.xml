<plot>Inspector Amar Nath apprehends and arrests notorious gangster who goes by different alias (Deshbandhu Jagannath, Pinto, Abdul Karim), and get sentenced to prison for several years. Amar, who comes from a wealthy family, defies his father, Jagirdar Bishamber Nath, and marries a poor but pretty woman, Sheela Sharma, and is asked to leave the family home. Amar and Sheela settle elsewhere and soon are the proud parents of a daughter, Jyoti. They meet with the parents of young Deepak Kumar and arrange a child-marriage of their daughter with Deepak. Then Pinto escapes from prison, hunts down Amar and Sheela and kills them, but a loyal employee and chauffeur, Abdul, saves their daughter's life, and takes her to Jagirdar, who accepts her with tears in his eyes. Years later, Deepak and Jyoti have both grown up. While Jyoti still lives with her wealthy grandpa, Deepak's dad has passed away, leaving his widow destitute. When she goes to confirm their marriage, Jyoti shuns and humiliates her. This enrages Deepak and he vows to make Jyoti apologize to his mother, as well as confirm their marriage. But Jyoti is already in love with wealthy Raman, and Deepak meets a famous Bollywood actress, Sandhya, who falls in love with him. What will happen to the promise he made to his mother?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?391395</url></doc>
