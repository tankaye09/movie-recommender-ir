<plot>Salim has been born lame, and lives with his mom, dad, and a sister who is old enough to be married. He and his dad search around for a suitable groom for her, and he meets Aslam. Salim rejects Aslam, as Aslam is not making enough wages that are commensuerate with his qualifications. Salim meets with some gangsters, who promise him that they will make him rich soon, and all he has to do is incite religious riots, pitting Hindus against the Muslims, and he will be well rewarded. Salim has always wanted to be rich, but will he take this opportunity to be wealthy?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474667</url></doc>
