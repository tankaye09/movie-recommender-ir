<plot>A brief exploration of the life of a woman experiencing an emotional crisis, as we follow her through three different periods in her life. We watch as she distances herself, severing her closest relationships, and the attempt years later to recapture what she lost. Following three crucial periods in her emotional development from the birth of her love, until the moment where she tries to deal with the repercussions of her actions and salvage the damage she inflicted on herself and those she loved. A life in fragments, both in how we see the story unfold, as well as her emotional state.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632017</url></doc>
