<plot>Television comedienne 'Jonsson, Ulrika' (qv) presents a series of comedy programmes where members of the general public volunteer to make a public exhibition of themselves. They do this by allowing videotapes recorded during their disastrous wedding day or honeymoon holidays to be shown and by being interviewed by Ulrika about their misfortune and misadventures. What should be one of the happiest and most memorable days of their lives, for reasons beyond their control turns into a nightmare and becomes unforgettable for all the wrong reasons!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076846</url></doc>
