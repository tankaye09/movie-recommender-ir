<plot>Pocho Espinoza, a vicious and murderous bandit known as "The Spanish Plague" is captured by a Sheriff and brought to a dungeon jail cell in an unknown location. As Espinoza waits in his cell for his posse of killers to come for him before he is hanged at dawn, he meets the mysterious Outlaw. The Outlaw is planning an escape and as Pocho's time is running out he tempts the reluctant Outlaw with a reward in gold so he can join him but as the treacherous night grows darker it is uncertain if any of them will keep their part of the bargain. Nothing is what it seems and the end is far from what you expect in this western tale of greed, murder and revenge set in the late 1870's.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082813</url></doc>
