<plot>A preview to the eventual feature length film, "The Key" is the story of a boy's journey to learn about the grandfather he never knew, a revolutionary invention his grandfather never finished and a father who doesn't want to open the door to the past. Robert Asbury is an eleven-year-old boy who lives alone with his widowed and emotionally distant father. One evening, while flipping through television channels he stops on a show discussing famous inventors, including an infamous 'failed inventor', Gregory Asbury, a name and a picture that is too familiar to ignore. When Robert finds an old picture of his grandfather and compares the two, his ordinary life is about to change. Against his father's wishes, Robert heads out in search of answers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?568050</url></doc>
