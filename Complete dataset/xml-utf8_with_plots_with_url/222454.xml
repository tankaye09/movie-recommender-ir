<plot>Frida Kahlo began to paint in 1925 while recovering from a streetcar accident that left her permanently disabled. Many of her 200 paintings directly relate to her experiences with physical pain. They also chronicle her turbulent relationship with artist Diego Rivera. Today Kahlo's work is critically and monetarily as prized as that of her male peers, sometimes more so.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222454</url></doc>
