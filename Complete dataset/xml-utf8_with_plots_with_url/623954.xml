<plot>"This film shows the U.S. Cruiser Raleigh, which assisted to a great extent in wiping out the entire Spanish fleet at Manila. Her brave Captain is also in plain view, and it is a picture that will enthuse any audience. Everyone wants to see this trim war, with which Admiral Dewey punished the proud Spaniards. The film is perfect. The figures are clear and distinct in detail, and to show it is call for an encore."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623954</url></doc>
