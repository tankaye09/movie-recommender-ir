<plot>Set in the tiny West African nation of Sierra Leone at the height of its civil war in the mid-1990s, No Living Thing follows three people who lose everything in a rebel attack. Through their struggle to survive, they discover their losses do not spell the end of their lives, but mark the beginning. While this story is specifically about Sierra Leone, it is also a parable of hope for Africa as a whole.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398216</url></doc>
