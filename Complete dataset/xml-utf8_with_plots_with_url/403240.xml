<plot>It is the middle of winter. Nutty, a ninja squirrel with a split personality has his hunger set on what is quite possibly the last nut in the cliff-side forest. Nutty is your typical squirrel; but when he is in danger, all it takes is a cracking sound to turn him into the greatest ninja master ever! Getting from his end of the forest to the other end where the nut lies may be quite the challenge, for it seems another ninja master and his minions have their own plans for Nutty. Nutty fights his way to victory for the ultimate prize: the nut.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?403240</url></doc>
