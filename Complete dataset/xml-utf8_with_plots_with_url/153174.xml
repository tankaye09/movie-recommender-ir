<plot>In 1987, four New Jersey teenagers wrote a punk song called "Braindead." It was terrible. But it was also a blast. And it was enough for the members of The Bouncing Souls to turn away from the path of College and Career to pursue their music. Fifteen years later, The Bouncing Souls have signed with Epitaph Records, toured four continents, and played with countless legendary punk bands, including Fugazi, Bad Brains, Green Day, Agnostic Front, The Descendents, and The Ramones. But it wasn't always so glamorous. For years the band struggled with obscurity, homelessness, and more than its share of breakdowns (both mental and vehicular). Culled from over 400 hours of archive footage shot and collected by lead singer Greg Attonito, and over 50 hours of interviews with the band and their extended family of friends, Do You Remember? is the story of the good times and the bad, and the music that was born out of both.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?153174</url></doc>
