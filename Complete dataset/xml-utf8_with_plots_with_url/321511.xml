<plot>After defeating Ravanji, Bhagwan Shri Ram returns to Ayodhya, is crowned the emperor and settles down to a harmonious lifestyle along with his biological and fosters mothers, three brothers (Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughan), their respective wives, and his very own wife, Devi Maa Sitaji, who is expecting soon. When his spies inform him that his reputation may be at stake as Sitaji had spent over a year in Ravanji's Lanka, he asks a reluctant Lakshman, to ensure that Sitaji is sent to exile. A devastated, pregnant, and distraught Sitaji is rescued by Maharishi Valmiki, who takes her to his Ashram, renames her Lokpavni, where she subsequently gives birth to two sons, Kush and Lav. Valmikiji trains them in every possible way, including knowledge, warfare, and religion. Ten years later, the twins decide to visit a drought and famine-ravaged Ayodhya to get the blessings of Ramji and Sitaji as well recite the Ramayan - and this is where they will find out that Ramji has exiled Sitaji, and they return home disappointed and refuse to recite the Ramayan anymore. The twins then stop the Aswamedha horse not realizing that they will soon be thrust into confrontation with none other than Lakshman, Bhagwan Shri Ram, Bhagwan Shri Hanuman, and the entire army of Ayodhya.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?321511</url></doc>
