<plot>Manville, NJ, the perfect little town for drug trafficing, police corruption and the criminal element. But who deserves to run it? Three years ago petty criminal Sam Frost made the biggest mistake of his life. He along with the town's corrupt sheriff Martin Quinn, his brother Mauricio, and Deputy Alex McCoy, decided to doublecross the notorious and feared criminal of all time, to gain control of the Manville drug territory. The four of them would soon have it all, they had just set up and sent away Dallas "The Devil" Bellmont. However, they forgot one minor detail, the Devil has many friends and surely wouldn't stay behind bars for long. With one honorable woman detective stuck in the middle of a corrupted police station, friends and enemies wandering the streets, and now the most dangerous villan of all returning home; it's obvious there's trouble brewing in the town of Manville. When you don't know who's on your side anymore and you've got no one left to trust, you always have to look for the possible DOUBLECROSS!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?157261</url></doc>
