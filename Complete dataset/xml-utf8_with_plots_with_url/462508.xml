<plot>Ex-footballer Flynn (Robson Green) is thrown together with his estranged wife Alison when their mentally handicapped son goes AWOL from his training centre home. As roguish Flynn and long-suffering Alison chase the missing boy around the wild Welsh countryside, years of repressed hostility are exorcised in the heat of the their self-imposed rescue mission. The couple trace their marital breakdown back to the trauma of their son's affliction. Vigorous sparring gradually blossoms into a rediscovery of mutual attraction, and years of antagonism dissolve to reveal the fragile possibility of true love. Meanwhile the missing boy discovers a strange and exciting new world outside his training centre home. He's determined to prove to his antagonistic father that he deserves a life in the real world rather than being locked in an institution on his 18th birthday. His plan? To surprise dad by making his own way to London. His problem? Things just don't go as planned. But his ambition is rewarded when his exhausted parents finally catch up with him. Jolted into belated maturity by the crisis of the last two days, Flynn has learned to recognise the value and potential in himself, his ex-wife, and, at last, his son. Tentatively, but with fresh hope, the family unites for the first time in years to face the future ahead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?462508</url></doc>
