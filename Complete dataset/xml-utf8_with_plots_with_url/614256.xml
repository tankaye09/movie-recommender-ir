<plot>A mountaineer named Climber is given a small cross by a mysterious friend named Theia, who wants Climber to carry it to the summit of a stairway that stretches from Earth to the distant stars. Climber makes it halfway up the stairs when his climbing partner abandons him. In despair, Climber writes and sends letters to Theia, who is back on Earth; Letters that plead and cry out for help but are seemingly never answered. Light years away from Earth and the summit, Climber must now overcome the hurt and anguish tearing away at his spirit and find the strength to reach the stars or give into the deadliest forms of despair tempting his mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?614256</url></doc>
