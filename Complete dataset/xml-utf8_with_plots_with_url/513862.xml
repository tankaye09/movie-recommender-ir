<plot>This game show was focused around the newest trend of the 80s: video games. Contestants would answer questions, and the one who would answer a question right, would get their choice of what video game to play. The points scored in the video game would be added on to their total score in the game. The winner would play a bonus round for prizes. Sidenote: This game show was also responsible for introducing Don Bluth's Dragon's Lair to the world.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?513862</url></doc>
