<plot>When the picture first appears, a bald-headed man is seen seated back of a table on which a number of cosmetics are lying. He has tried them all without success. He knocks on the table and a maid appears, bringing with her a box containing a number of bottles. In one of the bottles is a certain liquid, which, it is presumed, will grow hair on a bald head. A few drops applied to the head produces a bunch or tuft of hair directly on top of his head. He continues to apply the magic liquid until his head is crowned with a luxuriant growth of black hair reaching to his shoulders. He resolves to grow whiskers at once, and, rubbing his wet hands on his face, he obtains his wish. He rings for the maid, who is astounded at the marvelous properties of the water, and he is so happy at the results obtained that he embraces the maid, who is immediately adorned with a growth of hair on one side of her face. Seizing the bottle in her rage, she throws the contents at him, and his arms and hands are covered with a thick growth, while she flees in terror, and the man grows frantic in his endeavor to rid himself from the surplus hair. Very funny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?343943</url></doc>
