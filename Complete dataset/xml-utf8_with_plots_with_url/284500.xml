<plot>Here we present a most perfect picture of Kaiser Wilhelm, the ruler of the great German Empire. He is accompanied by the Empress, who stands in the centre of the parade ground at Berlin, while the troops march in review in company formation. Besides being a most perfect picture of the Emperor and Empress, it is a most excellent military scene. The alignment of the troops is perfect, and the effect is most thrilling as they march by their Commander with their heads erect, and every eye straight to the front. The peculiar parade step of the German army is introduced in this picture. The Kaiser acknowledges respectfully the salute of each commanding officer as the line pass his position.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?284500</url></doc>
