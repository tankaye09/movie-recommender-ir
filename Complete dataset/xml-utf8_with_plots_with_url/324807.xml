<plot>Almost everybody has already lived this kind of experience. One day, around the corner, you meet a poor stray dog. Inevitably dirty, hairless, and of course bad smelling. Lost in idleness, that particular day, the dog decides to follow you. It usually lasts a few meters, one or two blocks at most... A few words like "Get off, fucking dog!" would be enough to persuade the intruder to go and find another best friend. Now, imagine that it doesn't stop, that its retinian persistence focuses on your own image. That it follows you everywhere, all your life. It invades your vital space so deeply, that its real nature can only blow up. And suddenly, this vermin becomes a worrying predator.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?324807</url></doc>
