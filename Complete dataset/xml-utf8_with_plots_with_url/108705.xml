<plot>Evan Cooper is a typical twelve-year-old kid with high aspirations. One day, after watching a young entrepreneur brag of his financial success in an infomercial, Evan decides to put his ambitions to test. He soon invents an innovative tension-relieving device that will surely push him toward a life of sheer luxury. He designs a prototype and begins to sell his invention by traveling door-to-door. Within little time, big businesses assert their desire to massively produce his homemade device. Soon Evan obtains wealth beyond his wildest dreams; from buying electronic scooters to gigantic mansions, he truly takes advantage of his financial status. Years later, however, Evan learns that his success has caused him to give up something important-- something a person cannot purchase. It is at this point that Evan experiences something both fantastic and dismal that will completely shatter his vision of the "perfect" lifestyle he has built for himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108705</url></doc>
