<plot>As the video America's Army takes off we see how two brothers, Christoffel and Ryan, transport home their recently acquired computer. They spend the rest of the time totally isolated from the world in their attic, playing 'America's Army', a computer game in which the player is recruited by the Special Forces of the American army. When it finally becomes clear that the boys are, virtually as well as in reality, unfit for a career as a soldier, they hurl themselves on a new computer game with total abandon; in it they race sports cars through empty streets. America's Army was made at the instigation of the Brussels Tribunal - a committee of artists, writers and intellectuals who speak out against the U.S. interventions in Iraq.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034447</url></doc>
