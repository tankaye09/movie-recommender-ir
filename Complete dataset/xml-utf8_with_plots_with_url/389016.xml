<plot>Having discovered a Jackie Collins book where the main character is called Nick Angel, the real Nick Angel felt strange reading the sexual exploits of someone with his own name. It is this book that leads him to wonder what it must be like to have famous namesakes. Scanning the electoral register, Nick learns that pretty much every famous fictional or real famous person has a namesake somewhere in the UK and he sets out to meet and interview them to hear their stories and see if it has affected their lives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?389016</url></doc>
