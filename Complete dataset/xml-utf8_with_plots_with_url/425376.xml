<plot>In this scene a great throng of people--men, women and children--is discovered sitting upon a plain. Christ comes from the far end of the scene, passing through the multitude as all reverently rise. The disciples bring out five loaves and two fishes. Christ motions all to be seated. Then, blessing the food, He sends the disciples among the multitude, and all eat. The scene closes with the disciples gathering up the remains in large baskets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425376</url></doc>
