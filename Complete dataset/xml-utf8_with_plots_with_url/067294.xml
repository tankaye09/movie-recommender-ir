She thinks she has Ashok all to herself, only to find out that another young woman, Renu, also has an interest in Ashok and that Ashok has been taking care of her for years. When she meets Renu she hopes to teach her a lesson, but instead who she meets is someone delicate and mentally imbalanced, and she decides to assist her.
