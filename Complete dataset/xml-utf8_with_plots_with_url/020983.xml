<plot>In animation, Howie Hurls waits at a bus stop, looking stupid, as a flying saucer stops in front of him in its hunt for specimen. The aliens bring Howie on board and initiate a fear endurance test. Howie lives up to his name. Then, he's subject to an anal probe, performed by a large and pitiless machine that leaves the lad marked for life. Years later at the UFO abduction therapy center, Howie finds others with whom he has at least two things in common.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020983</url></doc>
