<plot>Aster Smith is the only uninfected survivor who is immune to a virus thought to be natural, but is revealed to be a man made biological weapon that has gotten out of control, and is plaguing humanity. A virus that turns normal humans into ravenous, murderous, lunatics. Under the guise of protection from the outside world, Aster is being held against his will at a Government run research facility with infected humans whom have not turned yet. The Government is studying him to try to figure out why he is not sick, and hopefully produce an antidote. Then they will attempt to kill Aster, the only living evidence that links this virus to the Government. There are a few uninfected citizens outside of the compound who plan to expose the Government at all costs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?434490</url></doc>
