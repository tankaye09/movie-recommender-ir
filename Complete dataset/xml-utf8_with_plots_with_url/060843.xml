<plot>After the sudden death of her husband from heart attack, an elderly woman moves into a retirement community. Soon after arriving, she discovers her former high school sweetheart is also a resident, and though she says she isn't looking for love, the old spark is still there. However, her old beau suffers from a chronic heart condition and a meddling daughter, both of which threaten to stifle the new romance. With the help of their octogenarian friends and a little climactic water ballet, love finds a way, and our happy couple walks very, very slowly off into the sunset.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060843</url></doc>
