<plot>Michel, a famous Greek director, is making "Romeo and Juliete" starring unknown actress Angeliki, his girlfriend. Not believing in true love and what Romeo represents, the cynical director is creating a digital Romeo to star opposite Angeliki and will give the play a twist by having her kill Romeo half way through the film. Angeliki on the other hand, unable to find true love in Michel, is presented with a dilemma when Romeo materializes before her and challenges her beliefs. Cynical director Michel is making "Romeo &amp; Juliet" with a twist: true love does not exist. Romeo is played by a digital actor who will come face-to-face with Michel's girlfriend who plays Juliet and who is far more romantic than him. Does true love exist?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?025636</url></doc>
