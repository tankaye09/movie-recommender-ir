<plot>For the past few days, Mun has repeatedly left messages on his ex-girlfriend's pager. Things change when a film director asks Mun to write an elaborate script on the 1997 handover of Hong Kong. By gathering information, Mun digs up his own history. On the same night when he was born thirty years ago, his mother left the world; and at the same time there was a fight at the turn of the streets... The financing of the shooting becomes a problem and the director has to give up. However, Mun refuses to give up hope on love. He starts to follow his ex-girlfriend. Unexpectedly, one accident, an orange changes everything and puts an end to the struggling and confusion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?495970</url></doc>
