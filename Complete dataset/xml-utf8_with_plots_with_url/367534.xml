<plot>Erol has been told that he has cancer and only three months to live. He decides to commit suicide, yet his suicide attempt turns out to be a failure. He donates his blood to a fatally wounded girl and plots to get himself killed by an assassin called Ipsiz Sabri. Sabri accepts the deal in order to have money to cure his sick son. Sema invites Erol to her birthday party. They fall in love with each other, but Erol hides his illness from her. Erol starts to date his ex-girlfriend to make Sema angry and to end their relationship. Sema gets engaged to her admirer Selim. Erol gets a message from the hospital saying that he is not sick and that his reports had got misplaced. Sabri, whose son got cured, is after Erol. He catches him though he doesn't kill him. His pistol is empty - he says that he has acted this way only to deserve his money. Finally, Erol and Sema get married.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?367534</url></doc>
