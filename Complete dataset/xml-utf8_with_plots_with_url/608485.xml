He is in love with a beautiful young woman named Jenny, who is Christian, who lives with her mom, and younger sister. Vishal wants to be close to her whenever he can, be it on the pretext of learning to dance or accompanying her on a photo shoots, much to the disapproval of his mom. Unable to get intimate with Jenny either at her home or at his, he and his friends, Rajesh, Poison, Mahesh and Anand, get together to assist Vishal spend time alone with Jenny. Looking forward to spending time with Jenny, Vishal agrees to all the conditions placed on him by his friends - not knowing that he was being drawn in a seemingly unending evening of terror, deception, as well as becoming the target of Muslim and Hindu extremists who are now on a rampage in most areas of Bombay.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?608485</url></doc>
