<plot>A spiritual journey of two tortured souls... one seeking to discover what will make him whole again... the other desperate to hold on to what he already has. It has been over 60 years since New York City blues man, Floyd Lee, left the hill country of Mississippi and with his exodus he turned his back on a troubled childhood and a harsh life in the cotton fields. Abandoned by a mother he never knew, Floyd still wrestles with unanswered questions to his mysterious and painful past. Now at the age of 73, Floyd and his band embark on a deeply personal journey back home to Mississippi to reconnect with the family he left behind and search for the family he never knew. Throughout, guitarist Joel Poluck steers Floyd's career towards musical success while his personal life spins out of control.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206548</url></doc>
