<plot>After watching his father, Masterji, getting killed; his sister, Laxmi, getting sexually assaulted by Sangram Singh, Dharamdas and Nandan, and then killing herself; and his younger brother, Munna, being thrown in a river, Ajit swears to avenge this during this lifetime. He starts by killing Nandan the very next day, and then absconding to Bombay, where he takes to crime with the help of Mohan. Years later Ajit has accumulated a lot of wealth through crime, is known as Rajasaab and also as Shaki Lutera. He still thirsts for revenge and does get a chance to kill the second of the three assailants, namely Dharamdas, but Sangram Singh continues to elude him. One day when his vehicle breaks down, a young man comes to fix it. Ajit notices that he has the same tattoo as his and is overjoyed to be reunited with his younger brother. Ajit does not know that the man claiming to be his brother is none other than Sangram Singh's only son, who wants to find out about Ajit's weaknesses and then ultimately kill him. The question remains where is the real Munna, and why has he not been found yet?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290362</url></doc>
