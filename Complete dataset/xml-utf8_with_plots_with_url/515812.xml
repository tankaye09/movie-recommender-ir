<plot>Leaving behind a life of midwestern monotony, Stan, aka Bloodclot, has started a new life, painting still life's and living the artists dream. After a few galleries start to show interest, other interests make themselves known. Lauren, taken by one of Bloodclot's paintings, decides she must model for him, even though she has never bared herself for any artist. Until now. They meet at Bloodclot's loft, and after the usual gettin ta know ya chit chat, Bloodclot gets to work. Lauren, her usual enthusiastic self, cannot help but to comment on Bloodclot's paintings, her life, her childhood, etc. etc. Bloodclot, his usual dour and quick to temper self, rather bluntly cuts her off. They stand in silence, Lauren nude, lit only by the light of day and interior practical lights, and Bloodclot almost pouncing on the painting, as if making up for lost time. As Lauren reveals more about her life, it becomes increasingly clear that the two actually know one another!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?515812</url></doc>
