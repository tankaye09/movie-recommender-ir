<plot>On a set of a living room, an old man, his head bandaged, is sitting in a chair. A white-haired man enters and sits opposite him. Their conversation is depicted by the use of balloon cartoons on the wall, and one word at a time appears in a balloon. The friend suggests placing an ad for a nurse, which the old man does. The remainder of the film shows a large group of women answering the ad, and the frightened old man running off, with the entire group in close pursuit. Two finally catch and drag him home. The following scenes show him attempting to escape by various means, but he is caught every time and brought back home. Finally, his friend arrives, and the old man leaves him to cope with the two nurses.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?647122</url></doc>
