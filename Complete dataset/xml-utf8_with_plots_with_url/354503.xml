<plot>Three contestants competed in this quiz show, taped at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. Host Harrison asks a toss-up question based on the outcome of a poll. A correct answer allowed the player to choose a category from a special board; the category names were based on the mall's shops, with questions based on that shop's theme. The contestant could receive hints from the interactive "mall-cam" (where store employees and shoppers provided what they believed was the correct answer to the question). "Mall-cam" helpers who supply correct answers could also win a prize. The contestant who answers the most questions correctly after two rounds was champion and played the bonus round. In the bonus round, correct answers to multiple-choice questions were worth $100; seven correct answers won a $5,000 bonus, while three incorrect answers stopped the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354503</url></doc>
