<plot>"My Father the Fisherman" is an emotional ride into the life of excitement, thrills, and dangers that lifelong commercial fisherman John Mangiapane experienced first hand, in his determination to provide a living and household for his wife and only son. The movie is a dedication to a man who risked his life and pushed his will to the limit, just so his son could attend and graduate from college. John Mangiapane Jr. narrates the movie to an original writing he dedicated to his parents. The narration is spoken in an ancient Sicilian dialect developed and used by the fishermen from the "old country". In adopting his original script to a foreign language, John Jr. conferred with his Dad to translate each word and pronunciation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?383776</url></doc>
