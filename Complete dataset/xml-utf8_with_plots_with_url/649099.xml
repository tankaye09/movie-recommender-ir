<plot>Two old Chinese communists arrive in the West. The man has no voice, but he writes notes: "Water is so good in the West." "Flowers are long dead on Karl Marx's grave." "English trains don't respect people's time." "When Picasso died, my daughter was born." He observes the drifting clouds, his wife looks at the Houses of Parliament. As he wanders in the Vatican, his wife still praises the English parks. This is the first, and maybe the last time, they leave China. He wants to see the whole world before he dies, but her heart longs for home. As Lao Tzu said : "the further you travel, the less you understand".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649099</url></doc>
