<plot>Every year, the monsoon turns this desert into a sea. Water levels rise as high as you or me. When the rain stops, the water slowly sinks into the ground, leaving salt behind. Saltpan workers and their families move into the desert to make salt. They build houses and install pumps to bring salty water from under the ground into surface basins; water that will crystallize into six-sided salt cubes. Children move into the desert with their families and while their families work, they go to school in the Rann of Kutchh, Gujarat.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218637</url></doc>
