<plot>Ram Sinha comes from a wealthy family. His mother would like him to get married so that their family can have a heir. Ram entrust's this job to his mother, and let's her decide who he should marry. Ram's marriage is arranged with a beautiful young woman named Chitralekha. After the marriage, Ram accuses Chitralekha of being inhuman, a ghost, who is out to kill him. But Chitralekha denies this, and pledges her lifelong love for him. Ram, his friend, Rajesh, and his wife decide to travel elsewhere, but no matter where they go, they see a ghostly apparition of Chitralekha following them everywhere. Ram subsequently finds out that Chitralekha had lost her lover in a previous life, and has taken form in this life to kill him so that they can be together forever. Shortly thereafter Ram is killed in an car accident. The police are unable to identify his body as it is burnt beyond recognition. It is after Ram's death that the truth surfaces. But will this truth benefit Ram and Chitralekha?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020786</url></doc>
