<plot>Mr. and Mrs. Hans Schneider are seen in their home after having partaken of their evening meal. Hans reads a newspaper, smokes his great pipe and occasionally takes a sip of beer from a large "Stein" standing at his elbow on the table. Mrs. Schneider is busy knitting, and indulges in a cup of tea. Finally Hans takes some snuff. He offers it to his better half who refuses it several times, but finally is induced to take some, when she is taken with a violent fit of sneezing much to the merriment of those who witness it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380388</url></doc>
