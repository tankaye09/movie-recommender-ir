<plot>A photomotion, alter-narrative re-telling of fragments of a story. A notion of play is projected upon despair and trickery, only visible through the looking glass of the frame. A female figure leads each frame through a dialogue of re-telling, by way of telling a story which is punctuated by falling down a hole, becoming smaller, larger and encountering a cat. This is Not Alice. Perception of depth in the static frame is translated into fantastical sequences, mechanized by placing the figure near and far, upright and upside down, sideways and absent. By confining the movements of the story telling to pieced still frames, the body within it becomes strictly codified, any dalliance or mischief in the frame having to be deliberate and clear. All is in the past tense and one frame is trying to explain the story of that previous, resulting in a cascade of recollection, reaction, the traces of each refracted in future frames. So, the telling of the story of Alice becomes Not Alice at all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400993</url></doc>
