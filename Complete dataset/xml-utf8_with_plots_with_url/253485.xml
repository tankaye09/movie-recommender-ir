<plot>One rainy and ominous night, a beautiful young rich girl, Eliza, takes shelter in the house of a friend, a poor painter. She wants to get away from her past and the ghosts haunting her. She becomes the artist's model and lover; he, however, was involved with another woman, who, nevertheless, doesn't stand in his way since she decides to back off and marry a widower. This widower has a son who is in love with Eliza and looks for her, but when he finds her she is already in the arms of the painter. Respecting her choice, he walks out of her life, letting her taste happiness with the painter, whom she obviously adores unconditionally.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253485</url></doc>
