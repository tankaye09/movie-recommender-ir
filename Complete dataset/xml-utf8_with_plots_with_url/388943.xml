<plot>Masuo is a hapless salaryman: squat, homely, with receding hairline and few social graces. He lives with his parents and looks older than he is. He has masturbatory fantasies about Anko, a schoolgirl who rides the same train as he. Pictures of her fill his wall. His sister and her boyfriend encourage him to tell Anko how he feels; otherwise, they say, he's a stalker and a pervert. Masuo puts a transmitter in a teddy bear and contrives to give it to Anko along with a note. Now that he has ceased to be anonymous, how will he handle her response? Is the film an examination of a culture's tolerance for older male fantasy and younger female passivity or just the story of one loser?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?388943</url></doc>
