<plot>A desert prospecter, Dick Norton, decides to head to the Klondike in search of gold. In the Klondike, Norton becomes a mining engineer whose honesty upsets a crooked Mortimer Pearson. Norton's girlfriend, Violet Winter and her father suddenly arrive in town. The father has taken ill. A fight breaks out between Pearson and Norton over Violet. In the struggle, which Norton wins, Norton's tie tac is caught on Pearson's sleeve. Pearson sends his men to obtain directions to a valuable mine. During the theft, the owner, Dowing, is shot, but is able to write a message. Pearson places Norton's tie tac on the body and steals the note. Norton is arrested for the murder. Violet, hoping to save her father's life, turns to Pearson, who has an Indian take her father to a doctor. Meanwhile, Lightning Girl keeps watch outside of Norton's jail-house window. Pearson coerces Violet to accompany him on a trip to claim the stolen mine. Norton sends Lightning Girl to get his coat, which has a file in it. He escapes and the pair head off after Pearson and Violet. Lighting and Norton arrive just in time to save Violet from an attack in a cabin. Norton and Pearson fight, with Norton grabbing the papers and tossing Pearson out. Pearson heads to town to get help since the papers include the note from the dead man. Finding the note, Norton knows they are now in danger. He gives all the papers to Lightning Girl and sends her to Dolan's. As Lightning Girl makes her way, Norton and Violet fight off the killers. Lightning and Dolan's gang arrive just in time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547108</url></doc>
