<plot>The Stevie Wondershow is a dark comedy about Stevie, a lonely, strange, and quiet middle manager. To his employees he's spineless but in his apartment he's the star of the craziest, most off-the-wall TV show imaginable. Stevie keeps his show all to himself, but when the office show-boat, King, finds out about Stevie's show, he sees it as a chance to re-establish himself as the center of attention with his friends. King convinces Stevie to put his show on at a local bar in hopes that Stevie's bizarre antics will put attention on himself. His plans backfire though, and Stevie quickly becomes a local celebrity. Soon a charismatic television producer approaches Stevie about creating a reality show. Stevie takes the offer and soon The Stevie Wondershow is the hottest thing on TV. Nationwide Stevie and his show are beloved. King goes crazy with jealousy. With Andy, who idolizes King, as his sidekick, King becomes obsessed with Stevie's success and will stop at nothing to take back the spotlight. The Stevie Wondershow is a satirical look at the power of reality TV and the fine line it creates between fame and infamy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?593173</url></doc>
