<plot>Since 2003 Vancouver, BC has been ranked one of the most livable cities in the world. But deep in the heart of this stunning city lies a dark secret known as the DOWNTOWN EASTSIDE, a 5-block radius of premiere real estate infested with disease and hard core drug abuse. This neighborhood has the highest HIV rate in the industrialized world. 1 out of every 3 residents has HIV and 90% have Hepatitis C. These statistics are on par with Botswana. This enormous decline in public health rates prompted the Canadian Government to re-evaluate their approach on the so-called "WAR ON DRUGS". The result was the most criticized Government approved drug policy in decades. INSITE - North America's first legal, Government funded Supervised Safe Injection Site was born. Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is truly one of the most unique melting pots on the globe, where some of the top global drug legalization activists are based. In this community, social workers are considered pioneers, activists are often considered criminals, and homeless drug addicts form the majority. This socially controversial film is told by some of the individuals living within this reality as well as people responsible for support systems, Government Officials, and local law enforcement agents. 100 Block will take viewers on a journey into areas deep within the Downtown Eastside to explore the reality that these people call home.
