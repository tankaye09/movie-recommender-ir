<plot>Here is the prettiest child picture we have yet presented to the public. A pretty infant in a high chair close to the camera, and his little brother has evidently taken his bottle from him, judging from the sad expression on its face, which shortly changes to a look of despair and then of anger. The pretty lips pucker up, the dimpled hands are raised to the eyes, and the tears begin to flow. Perfect.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?120054</url></doc>
