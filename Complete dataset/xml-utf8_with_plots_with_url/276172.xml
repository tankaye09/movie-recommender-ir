<plot>A documentary glimpse into the true life of a desperate and lonely street corner evangelist in Los Angeles; named John Chandler. As this Hollywood street preacher's grass root ministry evolves, a shocking but unique look into L.A. culture in revealed, as wicked and confused souls attempt salvation. Jogn Chandler's message is witty, controversial and a kick in the teeth to anyone who claims to know the Lord, and be doing the Lord's work. The lines between fiction and reality are jarred, and becomes blurry when John Chandler is mysteriously murdered, along with two of his disciples. An L.A.P.D. homicide detective's willingness to allow the camera crew access to film the murder scene, provides a chilling view into the obscure evangelist ministry; and his untimely death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276172</url></doc>
