<plot>Griffith is the director of a doomed student film. His lead actor quits, his set is rained out, and his crew consists of a single friend named Hunter. As Griffith braves a series of increasingly incompetent replacement actors, he struggles to hide his desperate crush on his crew member. When Hunter begins to display an obvious attraction for Heyward, the film's lead actress, Griffith is pushed to a total breakdown and forced to confront his own sexuality.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?223066</url></doc>
