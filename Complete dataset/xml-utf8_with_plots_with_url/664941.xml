<plot>So-yeon, who has been studying in Paris for several years, returns to Seoul for summer vacation. She is drawn to Min-hwan, a divorced man whom she met in Paris, but Min-hwan is non-committal and ambiguous about his feelings toward her. So-yeon meets a new guy. Hyun-jae, who is deeply into her, but So-yeon still waits for Min-hwan's call. She laboriously travels from Seoul to Busan, lugging around her luggage, just so that she can see Min-hwan. After the vacation is over, So-yeon returns to Paris.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664941</url></doc>
