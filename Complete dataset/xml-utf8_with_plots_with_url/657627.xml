<plot>In rural New Zealand, Harry and Eric are middle-aged men whose aged, tyrannical mother runs their lives. When she dies, serious questions come to the two men: "Should I have told her that I loved her?," "Who's going to cook the tea?," and "Pay for sex?" While Eric invites a goat into the living room to keep him company, Harry calls a prostitute. Meanwhile, mum is spinning in her grave, then she rises from the dead and begins walking toward the house where her lads, a goat, and a strumpet unknowingly await her verdict.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?657627</url></doc>
