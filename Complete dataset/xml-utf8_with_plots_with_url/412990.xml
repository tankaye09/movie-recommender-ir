<plot>In the early hours of March 24th 2002, Wendy Chandler awoke to a stranger taking off his clothes. He held her down, raped her and fled. At the time of the rape, Wendy was an award-winning filmmaker. Within months, she was barely able to eat, unable to work, scarcely able to function a person. Despite her ordeal Wendy came to realise she was one of the lucky ones. One of the Lucky Ones tells the story of Wendy's assault and its aftermath.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?412990</url></doc>
