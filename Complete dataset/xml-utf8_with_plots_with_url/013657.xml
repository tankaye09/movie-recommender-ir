<plot>A Moving Family Story is an essay documentary about a family's cross-country move and subsequent divorce told through the eyes of the filmmaker. It features a collection of 8mm family films, animated sequences, voice-over interviews, conversations and observational narration, the juxtaposition of which creates an intimate, introspective look at a collapsing family and the slippery identities carved from memory and celluloid records. In the act of piecing together the family's story, the filmmaker narrator engages in a stream-of-consciousness interaction with the family of his childhood as revealed by 1960s and 1970s film footage and the often-contradictory, emotionally charged memories of the family members today.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?013657</url></doc>
