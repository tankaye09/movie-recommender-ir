<plot>Geo the seer, on request of her own son, Sepeos, predicts the death of Kerysta the dancer from Tanagra, after she has danced three times. Messalina, the Roman empress, knew of Geo's powers to forsee the things to come, and went to consult her in her tent - and meets Sepeos just as he had heard his mother's prediction. As Sepeos had fallen in love when he first saw Kerysta, Messalina falls for Geo now, and immediately asks for affection in return, but he refuses her. Messalina is rejected, and dejected. She will use her arsenal of seductive poses and, caresses, then pleadings and promises, and finally imprisonment, punishment, and torture to achieve her end.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366804</url></doc>
