<plot>Two rival assassins at a poker game must determine the identity of a target after discovering they each have completely different descriptions of his identity and the result is a high stakes game where everyone stands to lose. An unfaithful husband having an affair with his wife's best friend plans to poison his wife during a dinner party. A desperate man who has lost everything wants to take his own life. Seemingly unconnected, these stories explore the concepts of chance and coincidence and all share one thing in common...one fate.</plot><plot>Two rival assassins at a poker game must determine the identity of a target after discovering they each have completely different descriptions of his identity and the result is a high stakes game where everyone stands to lose.
