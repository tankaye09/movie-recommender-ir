<plot>There are people that care about what they eat, there are people who don't, and there are people that will eat almost anything and not care about consequences, Lene Hansson is a woman that does care! Basically every week she visits a family, or individual, who claim to have problems with what they are eating. Hansson sees why they are putting on weight, why they continue to eat the food, why they are having body problems when continuing to eat, and much more. The two moments that I always kind-of look forward to are when they see a heap of everything they eat in a week, and Lene examines their poo! After that, they basically start a new healthy diet of fruits and vegetables, that will last about 3 weeks or something, to see how their bodies and health improve. Lene Hansson completely transforms these people's lives. Very good!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161079</url></doc>
