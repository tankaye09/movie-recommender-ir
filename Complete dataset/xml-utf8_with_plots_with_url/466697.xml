<plot>In a life of work, we work to live life. One businessman has the opportunity to take a step back and look at his life. To his dismay he sees a man who not only labored at work but also in life. The Laborer is a tale of two levels. It is a commentary of the workaholic lifestyles of the world. But more importantly it is the intimate story of a man who is detached from his feelings and as a result has prevented himself from taking the opportunities of life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?466697</url></doc>
