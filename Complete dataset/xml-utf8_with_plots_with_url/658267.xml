<plot>Women's Soccer at the University of North Carolina is one of the most successful athletic programs in NCAA history in terms of national championships (19 in 26 years). This behind-the-scenes documentary examines the 2007 team's struggles to uphold an NCAA Dynasty. Along the way they discover that winning isn't everything. Head Coach Anson Dorrance is an inspirational motivator and soccer strategist. Former Tar Heels, such as Mia Hamm, Heather O'Reilly, and Cindy Parlow, who are featured in the documentary, have set a high standard, and current players try to measure up. Raleigh native Emily Procter, Hollywood star of 'CSI Miami' and 'The West Wing,' narrates the documentary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658267</url></doc>
