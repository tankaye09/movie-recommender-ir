<plot>Raman (MGR) is incredibly rich, but too busy to find a wife. Chancing upon an old (yet "active") couple, Raman comes across a "formula" to "examine" women by - and starts looking for the right woman to meet all the criteria he has set out. A comely saleswoman (Jayalalitha) catches his attention - but is she everything she seems to be? Just 150 mins to find out! Plenty of the usual hardcore wigs and dream sequence costumes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?454808</url></doc>
