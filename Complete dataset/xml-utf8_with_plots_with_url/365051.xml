<plot>Three young women have an arrangement, taking turns to seduce strangers that drift into their backwater country town. It's Stella's turn when an ice sculptor arrives for the local rich girl's wedding, but her two friends, secretly jump their turn into his willing arms. All three are his life models for the ice bride and before long all their secrets are exploded under the sensual influence of the ice sculptor, seemingly destroying their friendships. More than friendships are destroyed when Stella chooses to run with the sculptor against her better instincts, having fallen for his sensual spell. It is her return to the town, and to the once despised life she knew, that allows her to follow her truest, most secret dream and escape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?365051</url></doc>
