<plot>Robert (Danny Fendley) is a recently release mental patient that imagins and visualizes his deadly nemesis so vividly the the man, Vernon (Jay Pearson) becomes real as time progresses. Vernon can only survive if he annialates Robert, his creator. As Robert proceeds on a cross country trip, there are many pschological twist and turns. Some are frightning some are dramatic while others are humorous and shocking, all with a unique style just as the characters along the way. Character driven and story driven to the extreme makes this movie a unique movie that will not let you guess the outcome until the end, and once you have figured it out, thats not it either.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?476484</url></doc>
