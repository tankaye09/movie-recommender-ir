<plot>While working on a documentary about alternative health, Eli learns that his dog Sheba has terminal cancer and is not expected to live more than three months. Eli sets out to see if there is an alternative to traditional veterinary care that will allow Sheba to live out her final days in comfort--and possibly to extend her life. Saving Sheba is ultimately a love story as Sheba lives for almost two years from her initial diagnosis, buoyed by Eli's love, increased attention and constant companionship in her final days.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479189</url></doc>
