<plot>'Spotters' is a fly-on-the-wall comedy documentary. Shot over a twelve-month period, it follows three engaging 'vintage transport' enthusiasts across the UK as they pursue their amazing and eccentric interests, unleashing their very un-PC opinions on the modern world. The storyline is structured into themed chapters, in which the characters brilliantly express themselves on a wide raft of issues, and deliver hilarious views on their loveable way of life and differing political leanings. Chris the bus enthusiast, Clive the plane-spotter, and Jim the train-spotter, are the freshest and funniest team of reality-show performers ever, and a new broom antidote to endless documentaries on make overs and gritty social issues.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?511460</url></doc>
