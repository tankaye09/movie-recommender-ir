<plot>Physicist Dr. Thor Pedersen, discovers while creating a huge and powerful anti-missile weapons systems for the United States Military, that the device accidentally creates inter-dimensional NODES or portals between similar dimensions that bring life here to Earth, or send our forms of life elsewhere. He stops creating weapons and begins scientific study. While he is conducting his own experiments at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, with his dynamic team, including his love interest Dr. Barbara Reed, college Physicist Jesse Odan and his brave engineer Johann Heimdall, the Military fires off the huge ULTRAMAK weapon he designed. As the ULTRAMAK blasts upward it interacts with the Aurora, a huge burst of solar radiation, that combine to open a huge NODE that allows evil to invade in the form of the absorbing organism, the Jormungand. Thor and his team are the only ones who can stop the pouring in of alien organisms, the spreading darkness, and the utter destruction of Earth; by fighting to succeed in turning off the ULTRAMAK weapon and closing the NODE. But at what cost?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?399659</url></doc>
