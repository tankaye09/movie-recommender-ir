<plot>When Robert and Rosemarie Stack (Robert starred in Boetticher's "The Bullfighter and the Lady") visit Mary and Budd Boetticher to attend the Boettichers' showing of their exquisite Portuguese Lusitano and Spanish Andalusian horses, Budd Boetticher takes the opportunity to narrate the proud history of these outstanding horses and their centrality to the development of the "rejoneador" (a bullfighter on horseback) and the kind of demanding training necessary to bring both horses and riders to performance perfection. Interspersed throughout is a recapitulation of Boetticher's career as a director of films about bullfighting as well as his now cult status as a director of westerns starring Randolph Scott. In the next day's performances, Budd and Mary Boetticher and Carlos Arruza, Jr., the son of Mexico's most famous bullfighter, Carlos Arruza, who was the subject of Boetticher's now mythic documentary "Arruza," demonstrate in the classically correct manner the art and skill of the "rejoneador."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?384243</url></doc>
