<plot>There are thousands of stories about regular women (and men) who would never call themselves "groupies" but have their personal tale about the one magical night they spent with their favorite rock star. A Night With... takes viewers on a nostalgic and insightful ride into the quirks, passions, fetishes and hang-ups of their favorite rock stars as told by the people who saw it first hand. You'll meet people who spent special evenings with U2, Keith Moon of the Who, Van Halen, Rolling Stones, Madonna, and Tommy Lee, and you'll hear their stories - from the salacious details to the hilarious moments. It's about romance. It's about obsession. It's about ONE night that changed their lives forever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014043</url></doc>
