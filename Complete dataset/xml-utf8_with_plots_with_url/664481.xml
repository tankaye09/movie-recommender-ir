<plot>Year Zero is a documentary that revisits the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge (KR) in Cambodia in the late 1970's. For thirty-two years, people responsible for the deaths of nearly two million people have lived freely and unpunished among other Cambodians. Aki Ra was a former KR soldier who has since devoted his life to the removal of land mines placed by the KR. Ra's narrative provides the backbone for the film and sets the stage for the upcoming tribunal. A terrible genocide that has lain dormant and nearly forgotten is on the verge of eruption onto the global stage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664481</url></doc>
