<plot>Jack The Ripper was the first modern serial killer. To this day his reign of terror remains one of history's greatest mysteries: motiveless, unmatched in brutality, and still unsolved. Now Laura Richards of Scotland Yard's Violent Crime Directorate re-opens the case. With the benefits of modern criminology and psychological analysis, and working with a team of experts, Richards uses 21st century techniques to understand a 19th century killer, dispelling the many myths that have grown up around the case. The results completely change our understanding of Jack The Ripper, providing a detailed psychological study of the kind of person he was, where he lived and even what he may have looked like.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272081</url></doc>
