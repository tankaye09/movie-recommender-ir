<plot>Sunder (Govinda) comes from his village to the big city. He is naive, easily influenced, and illiterate. His attempts to influence girls are mocked, and he is ignored and made fun of by his room-mates (Deepak Tijori, Laxmikant Berde, Kishore Bhanushali). One day he befriends an NRI, Payal Khurana (Rani Mukherjee), who thinks he is disabled and dumb. She feels sorry for him and decides to assist him get his voice back. She takes him to Dr. S. Puri (Om Puri), who is unable to find a solution. Sunder is thrilled at the attention he is getting from Payal, and decides to continue to pull wool over her eyes, for he knows that she does not love him, she only feels sorry for his handicap, and will soon be returning overseas. Little does he know that Payla is beginning to fall in love with him, and arranging for him to meet her aunt, Mrs. Chaudhary (Farida Jalal), and her mom and dad (Navin Nischal).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?449572</url></doc>
