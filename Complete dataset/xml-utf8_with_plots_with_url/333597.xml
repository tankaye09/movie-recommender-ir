<plot>Universal's "Sing and Be Happy" series was their contribution to the audience-participation sing-a-longs such as the "Community Sing" series from Columbia. The singing group in the Universal shorts was called "The Rhythm Masters" and they were ever bit as obscure as Columbia's "Song Spinners." This entry has campus footage from five colleges in the USA, and it was no coincidence that four of the five had football teams ranked high in the polls of that time. The exception being the University of Maine. It was included because the producers concluded that the audiences across America all knew the words to "The Stein Song" as it is the only college fight song to reach #1 in the pop charts; doing so in 1930. The songs include Notre Dame's "Victory Song"; "Peruna"(the name of the Shetland pony mascot) from Southern Methodist University; "Rambling Wreck" from the Georgia Institute of Technology, better known as Georgia Tech, and the University of California's "Hail to California."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333597</url></doc>
