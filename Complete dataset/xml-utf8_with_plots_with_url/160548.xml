<plot>The urge to get 'off-island,' hit the road, to go somewhere, find something, someone, propels a game of lost-and-found. In 'Drop,' Lev, 25, and Cal, 20, are both outcasts within their circle of friends. Lev, fed up with his band, decides to whisk Cal, fed up with her alcoholic mother, on a spontaneous road trip. Lev launches himself into an unknown future, but Cal secretly takes the opportunity to find something she lost long ago. The confines of the car lead to intimacy and claustrophobia as they clumsily take to the road.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?160548</url></doc>
