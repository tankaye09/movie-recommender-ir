<plot>Teenage Zef and little brother, Tutu, are two happy elephants. Who wouldn't be with the biggest backyard in the world to play in? - the wild plains of Africa. They merrily chase zebras, ostriches and warthogs, scarring them silly. There is a whole bunch of fun stuff to be doing and Zef is just the big brother to show Tutu how to get into all kinds of (mischievous) trouble. Until their mother and the family herd are taken from them in the dark of one dreadful night by The Badness. To cover up the truth of their fate from Tutu, Zef makes up a story about a rainbow taking their mum to the sky. Now, Tutu needs to find that rainbow and their mum. Zef wants to find a new herd, a new family. Their journey in search of both takes them on a high adventure - with the help of some ditsy rainbow Cranes, a very unusual vegetarian vulture and a few surprising types with some entertaining takes on the jungle. Along the way Zef and Tutu are joined by three other orphaned animals - Chump, a chimp insisting he is the King of the Jungle, Stretch, a very skittish giraffe and Cub, a Prince to the true jungle king. Together, this band of young African animals must find their way across unfamiliar, rugged terrain and face challenges like none they have known in their short lives. Challenges that test the brotherly love between Zef and Tutu as each insists on pursuing his own goal. Proving they have the stuff of all true heroes, the orphans rally around Tutu who believes the rainbow he is seeking is something they have to see with their heart and not their eyes. When they find the rainbow's end, they will find new families. Of this, Tutu is certain. All that finally stands between the animal band and the rainbow's end is The Badness that took their families. It is up to the orphans to stop The Badness from ever taking animal families again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?175202</url></doc>
