<plot>The Avro Jetliner which first flew in 1949 was North America's first jet transport. Numerous U.S. airlines wanted it and the United States Air Force was ready to order 20 for use as high altitude navigational trainers. Even the legendary Howard Hughes was ready to buy 30 Jetliners for TWA. But in the end, only one Jetliner was ever completed and flown. Design began on the Jetliner in 1946 and in the summer of 1949 the Avro Jetliner became the first jet passenger aircraft to fly in North America. With a seven year lead over the American competition, the Jetliner could easily have made Canada a world leader in the construction of jet passenger aircraft. But it was not to be. Why was this? Why was such a revolutionary aircraft destroyed less than eight years after its first flight? These questions and more are answered in this 31 minute video production on the Avro Aircraft C-102 Jetliner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?052776</url></doc>
