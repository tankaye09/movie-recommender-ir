<plot>In "All About Faces," two celebrity teams were shown a vignette in which an average person was secretly filmed. The "average Joe" was eventually caught in the middle of a moral or ethical dilemma; as the situation reached its climax, the vignette was stopped and the celebrities would then wager money on how they think the situation will be resolved (the subject's facial expressions also figured into the teams' decisions; hence the show's title). The rest of the film vignette was then shown with the outcome; whichever team amassed the most cash at the end of the show won the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?030460</url></doc>
