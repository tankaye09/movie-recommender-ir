<plot>Just before Christmas 2004, two men dressed as police officers arrive at a remote home and, after tricking their way inside the house they take the family hostage. Meanwhile at another house a second family is taken hostage. The reason for both movements was to gain control over two key employees of the Northern Bank in Belfast. The next day, while the families are still held, the employees are used to carry over Â£26,000,000 in cash out of the bank in broad daylight. This documentary looks at who did the robbery and how the failings of the British government contributed to the freedom of the robbers to act.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?543676</url></doc>
