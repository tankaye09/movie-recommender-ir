<plot>Blood addicted Vivia yearns for love amid her lonely eternity. She espies a young couple, Harker and Mina out on the town. Renfeld, a sinister drug dealer, bullies her into reeling them in as victims to feed her habit and create clients for him. After taking drugs in a club, Mina and Harker argue and fall out. Going their separate ways, they soon enter a nightmarish world of hallucination and chaos. After seeing Mina seemingly seduced by Renfeld, Harker is seduced by Vivia into her world of addiction and immortality. Becoming like her, Harker soon realizes his mistake. A slither of humanity wars in Vivia's soul - to release him or keep him for eternity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?293582</url></doc>
