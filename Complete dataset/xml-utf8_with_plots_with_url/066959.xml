<plot>1922 London . After a whirlwind romance, Betty May, model and muse to the bohemian elite, marries Raoul Loveday, a brooding poet just down from Oxford . But this passionate and tempestuous relationship is soon threatened by a far greater force. When Raoul falls under the influence of the occultist, Aleister Crowley, Betty is forced into a battle of wills for her husband's soul. Their doomed love affair is brought to an abrupt end by Raoul's untimely death under tragic circumstances, and Betty's hollow victory in bringing Crowley down. Screenplay by Ian Sugar, based on Betty May's controversial autobiography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?066959</url></doc>
