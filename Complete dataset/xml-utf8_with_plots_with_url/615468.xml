<plot>Fur-trapping French-Canadian brothers Jules and Jacques provoke the righteous wrath of the Pink Panther when one of their leg-traps in a forest ensnares the picnicking panther's tail. The panther, declaring himself "Pink Avenger", follows the two trappers to their cabin and plants biting turtles in each of their beds, causing each to think the other is responsible for the seeming practical joke. After fist-fighting, the two men realize that, "something's fishy," and they use their dog, Armand, to trail the Pink Panther. They are bitten by more turtles, one of them is caught in his own leg-trap, and the pair are then both catapulted by a recoiling tree into the horizon.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?615468</url></doc>
