<plot>The wizard's curse is a monster created by a magician from the brains of two dead criminals and it turns on its creator and kills him. Like the evil villain in the Bride with White Hair it is a bisexual being with the male and female parts appearing alternately. It thrives on killing and eating the brains of its victims and it seeks immortality by eating the brain of the taoist priest's virgin daughter. Copying the Terminator and Terminator 2 movies this creature is invincible and in a scene copied from these movies attacks a police station looking for its female victim.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?664054</url></doc>
