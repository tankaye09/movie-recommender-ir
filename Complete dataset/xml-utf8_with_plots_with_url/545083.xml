<plot>This picture was taken for the effects obtained in reversing the negative. The Bon Vivant comes home, and first draws a glass of ale; then lights his pipe and smokes; overturns a pot on the stove; tips over chairs and tables, and finally throws a lot of confetti into the air. In reverse the articles all fly back in a very mysterious and amusing manner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?545083</url></doc>
