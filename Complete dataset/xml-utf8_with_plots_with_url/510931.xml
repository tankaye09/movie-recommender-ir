<plot>'Split'n'Melba' is set on the distant planet Pear-th where fruit have evolved into the dominant species. Inspector Split, the top banana, and Sergeant Melba, a real peach, are the police 'farce' known as the 'Yard' (short for 'Orch-yard'). They are up against the incorrigible Mascaroni, a veritable one-pear crime wave whose plans, like himself, tend to go pear-shaped. Mascaroni steals the Mk 2 Bullit fighter-plane with catastrophic but hilarious results.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?510931</url></doc>
