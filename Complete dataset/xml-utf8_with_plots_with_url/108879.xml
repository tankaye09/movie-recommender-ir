<plot>Aaron Martin, an aloof 25 year-old whose 'Assistant Account Management Coordinator' job title seems to be as mundane and redundant as the life he leads is convinced to go on a date with someone he barely knows, thanks to a demanding co-worker and impeccable timing. Not only has his co-worker taken it upon herself to setup this date, his friend convinces him to go out on the same night as well. After meeting the intriguing Rachel later that night, Aaron's day began with discomfort and frustration, but might end with assurance, coherence, and possible satisfaction, depending on the choice he makes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?108879</url></doc>
