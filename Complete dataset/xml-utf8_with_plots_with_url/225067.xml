<plot>'Guns in the Afternoon' tells the story of Kieron Bernard, a.k.a. Kidco: gang leader, gangster rapper and street hustler, who went to public school. Born the eldest son of a poor single mother with nine children, he was brought up in the West London council estate of Emlyn Gardens. He lived for music and imbued himself in American gangster rap culture. Kieron was the leader and inspiration for his gang of rappers, who called themselves 'Tribel'. He loved his mother more than life itself and, through his music, tried to raise her out of poverty in order to make her happy. He had made numerous trips to the United States of America, working on his new album, and was due to sign a record contract the week he was killed. He died in a shootout in a Nandos chicken restaurant in Shepherds Bush on 30th January 2002 after an argument over his haircut. His music prophetically expressed the violent world and life he led until his untimely death. He was 25 years old. Using his rap music as soundtrack, the film depicts the two different ways his family and his gang members deal with the tragedy of his senseless death. It explores the underworld of the urban black youth and the nihilistic world they occupy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?225067</url></doc>
