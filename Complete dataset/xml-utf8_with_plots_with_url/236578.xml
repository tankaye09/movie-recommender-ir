<plot>Meet Herbie Duck. He's nice. Well meaning. He likes people. But he has a problem. A big one. He doesn't want to do what he does. At least, not so much. He wants what we all want; to be happy. And with someone. Herbie meets Rosie. She's young. Too young. Rosie's looking for her lost mother. Herbie's looking for Rosie. She might be his last chance. Or his next victim. Who's to say? Not Herbie. He doesn't say much.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236578</url></doc>
