<plot>This is a most astonishing picture, for although the automobiles are flying along the road at almost incredible speed they are shown sharply and distinctly without a blur. The road which is exceedingly picturesque, is lined with spectators and the whole scene is one of tremendous excitement. A very fine film in every way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049570</url></doc>
