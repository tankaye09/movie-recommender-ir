<plot>Vigilante, a mockumentary styled short, looks to answer the question of what would happen if someone decided the best way to rid our society of crime was to become a real live superhero. Yet, at heart, it's a story about two very different people who, over the course of a single night, learn to come to terms with their differing opinions and morals. As the story unfurls a costumed vigilante takes a documentary director and his crew through his nightly routines as he patrols various neighborhoods from the rooftops. However, before morning the director will discover the hero's true motivations and must decide between them and his own. He?ll be forced to ask: Does it take something fictional to make a real difference?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?640398</url></doc>
