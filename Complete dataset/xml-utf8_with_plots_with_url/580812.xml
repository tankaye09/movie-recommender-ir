<plot>We are in Brooklyn. The most diverse ethnic groups live here without sharing a folklore or tradition, each one on its own, but united by two common elements: the exchange of money and personal space as a cause to defend. One street, Broadway, serves as boundary and as common ground for three communities: the recently arrived artists, the Dominicans and the ultra-Orthodox Jews, all together underneath the tracks of the elevated subway that goes to Manhattan. In this multicultural space, the stories of three characters are intertwined: Gonzalo a young theater director from Spain who demands too much from himself and the people around him; Richie, a young Hispanic drug dealer who dreams of escaping the basketball court where he carries out his business; and Abraham, a Jewish landlord who withdraws into his work in order to avoid a reality he can't bear to face.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?580812</url></doc>
