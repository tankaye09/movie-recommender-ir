<plot>This film is about a family who fell apart after the death of wife and mother, Emily. Now Fintan, Ralph and their Father live in the same house where they do not see each other, speak to each other and at times seem to have stopped loving each other. Faced with an ultimatum at school Fintan decides that he has had enough and sets a plan in motion that will hopefully bring the family back together. He and his brother put their quarrels aside and work together to help snap their father back into reality and face the fact that although their mother is gone, they are still here and they need him to be here too.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176518</url></doc>
