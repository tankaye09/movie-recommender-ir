<plot>Vijay meets with Aarti and falls in love with her. Unable to convince her of his good intentions, he disguises himself as a teacher and woes her. She finds out about this, and eventually also falls in love with him. Vijay finds out that Aarti's dad, Shyamlal, is in danger of being killed. His attempts to warn him are ridiculed. However, Shyamlal does get killed, and the only suspect is none other than Vijay, who was apprehended at the scene of the crime by the police. In trying to prove his innocence, Vijay finds out that the odds are stacked up against him, and that no one, including Aarti herself, really believes him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?249877</url></doc>
