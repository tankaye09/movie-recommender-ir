<plot>Waverley is an intimate portrait of an ageing woman whose ordered existence is disturbed by a random accident. The accident, while seemingly trivial, triggers a deep-seated emotional crisis in Waverley. Lying beneath her apparent veneer of self-sufficiency is a troubled mind. Waverley's environment is a restrictive one. Her house is large and she is lonely within it. As she goes about her daily routine she looks uncomfortable and out of place. She seems odd in her old-fashioned car or as she eats in a caf√©. Her clothes, gloves and make-up are her armour. While Waverley is shaken by the accident, she does not, at first, seem noticeably upset and continues on her way. Over the reminder of Waverley's day, however, a palpable sense of unease develops. The space around her becomes more threatening. Darkness closes in. The accident, seemingly insignificant, stirs up long-buried emotions within Waverley and forces her to confront her past and come to terms with her hidden demons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?648630</url></doc>
