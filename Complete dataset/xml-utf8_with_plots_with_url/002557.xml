<plot>This documentary tells the story of Rachel and Leon, two young Jewish siblings who were sheltered by a working class family in the Nazi-occupied town of Compiegne, France, during World War II. When the children's parents did not return they were "adopted" into the Catholic family. These two children were the only Jews in Compiegne during the entire war. Now living in the United States they return to France for their "adopted" mother's 90th birthday party. The film includes interviews with all the surviving principals in the story, scenes of Rachel and Leon visiting the old apartment from which their parents were deported, and archival photographs and home movies.</plot><plot>This documentary tells the story of Rachel and Leon, two young Jewish siblings who were sheltered by a working class family in the Nazi-occupied town of Compiegne, France, during World War II.
