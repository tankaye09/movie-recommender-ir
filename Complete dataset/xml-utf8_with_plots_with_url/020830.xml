<plot>Alon's mom died of cancer. His dad, an insurance agent, can hardly stay at home because everything reminds him of his wife. After the seven days of mourning (during which he slept in the living room) he announces that he needs to be alone and he's heading to Eilat. Alon thinks this is a bad time for vacation and insists to at least accompany him. But Alon didn't know that this move is rather permanent: his dad has quit his job and he sold the car in order to go into a partnership on a Yacht. This way he will resume his youth lifestyle as a sailor. Meanwhile Alon falls for Betty, a traveler from Germany who temporarily works in Eilat, only to find out she's living within 2 days to New-Zealand, her next destination. Will son be like father?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020830</url></doc>
