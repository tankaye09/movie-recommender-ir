<plot>This beautiful scene was taken along the Columbia River and shows the saucy old river on a rampage at the Dalles and then winds its way around towards the ocean, through tunnels, past Cape Horn, where the wind howls and whistles around their base even in the most quiet days in summer; then on, passing interesting points in rapid succession. We come to The Needles or Pillars of Hercules, then to Rooster Rock, where close to the bank can be noticed the dwellings of the fishermen, etc., etc., making this another gem our expert photographer secured along this wonderful river.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422053</url></doc>
