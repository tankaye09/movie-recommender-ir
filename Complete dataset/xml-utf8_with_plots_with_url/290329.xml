<plot>Homi Mistry (Ashok Kumar) has been a widower for several years now, and looks after his four sons, their small house, and a job at the factory. Nargis Sethna has been widowed; is a housewife, has two sons and a daughter, and a large house. Then Soli (David), Nargis' and Homi's friend, suggests that the two get married, then at least the children will have a mother and father, as well as a larger house. They do get married, and hilarious chaos results, as the family and the children try to accomodate each other and fit in with their new family and surroundings.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?290329</url></doc>
