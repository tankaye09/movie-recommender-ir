<plot>Mohan Lal lives in a small rural town in India with his mother, and twin brother, Shankar. In order to improve their lifestyle, Shankar decides to re-locate to Bombay, with hopes to find a job and find accommodation for his Mohan and their mom. Mohan keeps in touch with Shankar through regular mail. Then one day a man named Raja Karan Singh visits them in their small tenement, tells them that he is Shankar's employer, gives them some money to pay for necessities and rent, and asks them to accompany him to Bombay to have his mom medically treated. After his mom recovers, the Raja asks them to live with him in his palace. When Mohan and his mother insist that Shankar be re-called back, they find out that Shankar is dead, and that the person responsible for his death is none other than Raja himself. The police are involved, they arrest Raja and charge him under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code - a charge that may lead to a death sentence. It is then that Mohan finds out that the Raja did not kill Shankar, and he races to overturn the judgment, as well as find the real killer, before the sentence is carried out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?124104</url></doc>
