<plot>Master Photographer Tony Sweet teaches the art of high dynamic range (HDR) photography. HDR photography captures a wider dynamic range than traditional photography is able to achieve. The technique uses a series of exposures at varying levels, and combines them with HDR software (Photomatix). The results range from hyper-realism to surrealism. Shot on location at Eastern State Penitentiary, HDR Photography Made Easy simplifies the steps of fine-tuning exposures in capture, merging with HDR software, and tone mapping the final image. Ten compositions with a range of tonal challenges are set up, captured, and processed. The program covers traditional, Pseudo HDR, and double-image processing. HDR Photography Made Easy will have you creating your own amazing HDR images in no time!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226347</url></doc>
