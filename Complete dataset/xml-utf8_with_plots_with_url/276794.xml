<plot>After young Konkan-based Vithoba Pawaskar fails in the 7th standard for the 3rd time, his father, Sripad, kicks him out, and he, with the assistance of Krishna Parkar, re-locates to Mumbai, lives in the hallway of a Chawl in a dilapidated Girgaum building along with Krishna's abusive wife, Savitri, does household chores for nearly 40 residents in the building, studies in night school, and finally becomes a graduate in Arts. He is all set to find a job, return home and prove to his dad and mom, Parvati, that he can stand on his own two feet. He does secure a job with Bollywood's Chotubhai Maganlal Dresswala, but encounters hostility from Savitri, and is disowned by his parents when he gets married to a Christian, Lucy, the niece of a local drunk, Pascal, as well as incurs the wrath of a hoodlum builder, Shakeel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?276794</url></doc>
