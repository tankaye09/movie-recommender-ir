<plot>Somewhere in a state of loneliness sits a man typing a letter. Through the downscaled universe of a living room in a small house we encounter a man trapped in his destiny, which is unfamiliar and troubling for most of us. His company consists of a dog and a parrot - and music. The days are exasperatingly long, tedious and boring. And after midnight, when everybody else is at sleep, he can finally venture outside for a brief walk with his dog. But Odd does not seem to give in, he still has his supply of crude humor. And out there somewhere is a friend who will show up, even in the darkest hours. Odd is everybody's unfamiliar neighbor, possibly our bad conscience. The film follows Odd heartily and closely through a series of uneventful days, and the occasional trip to the closest town for some essential supplies. While the unforgivable end comes alarmingly close.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407133</url></doc>
