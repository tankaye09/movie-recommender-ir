<plot>Woody is shooting pool at a farm house when one of his pool balls rolls into a nearby henhouse. He takes the ball back but must battle with the hen who thinks the woodpecker is taking one of her eggs. Woody makes several attempts to get the ball back from the protective poultry finally disguising himself as a macho continental rooster whom the hen falls for causing Woody to retrieve his ball. But it doesn't last long. The hen gets wise prompting Woody to trip spilling all the hen's eggs all over himself and getting conked with his own pool ball!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?505186</url></doc>
