<plot>American-returned Shankar Narayan is baffled to witness his former businessman and jailbird dad posing as a soothsayer by the name of Mahaprabhu Janak Sagar Jagat Narayan in a small town called Dharampur. He comes to know that his dad has learned a few magician's tricks from a fellow-inmate, and is able to fool the entire township with his "divine" powers. Shankar enlists the assistance of noted magician Goga, and brings him to Dharampur. Goga challenges the Mahaprabhu; is able to dethrone him; oust him from his temple, and takes over. His task over, Shankar asks Goga to leave, but power-hungry Goga, who now calls himself Gogeshwar, refuses to let go of his new-found position.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271682</url></doc>
