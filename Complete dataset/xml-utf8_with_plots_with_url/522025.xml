He re-locates to Bombay's St. Andrews College, has big dreams of being wealthy and driving a red Ferrari. He befriends 3 other middle-classed youth, Papad, Mushy, and Chicken. He borrows money from Matka Rajan, gambles it, loses everything, is unable to re-pay, and as a result Rajan sets his goons on him. He goes to a man named Baba for help, who in turn takes him to a Mamta Shekari, who offers to hire him as a hit man, agrees to pay him Twenty thousand Rupees for every killing, so that he can re-pay his gambling loan. Aryan reluctantly accepts, is trained by Baba to shoot a gun, and kills his first target, none other than Rajan himself. He tells his friends about his good fortune, and they too join forces with him. In all killing contracts they are provided with a photograph, the location, and are instructed to look at the photo just 15 minutes before killing the person.
