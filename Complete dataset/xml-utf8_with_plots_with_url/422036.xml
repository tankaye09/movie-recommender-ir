<plot>After running to the top of the cable incline in the picture listed above ['Ascending Mt. Low, California' (q.v.)], our camera was placed on the front end of a trolley car and the trip to the summit began, passing through Rubio Cañon which is the most thrilling portion of the entire trip up Mt. Low. This wonderful subject was taken 8,000 feet above the level of the sea and gives an audience some idea of the grand scenery in the vast Sierra Madre Mountains. When ascending the summit of Rubio Cañon you are far above the clouds and in close touch with the grandest productions of nature, which will surely be a revelation and will delight and interest an audience who are fortunate enough to see this most remarkable picture. The above picture will be sold in one length only.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422036</url></doc>
