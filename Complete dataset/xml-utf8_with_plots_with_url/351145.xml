<plot>On September 11, 2001, while talking to their U.S. based daughter via telephone, the Kaul family is thrilled to know that she is expecting a child soon, but their conversation is interrupted by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre. Both her sister and her husband perish in that attack. The Kaul family is devastated. They take some time to recover, and arrange their other daughter, Anupama's, marriage with Arpit Oberoi, who runs an advertising agency. Anupama and Arpit like each other, and are happy with this arrange marriage. While travelling by train, Anupama meets Aman, a plainclothes officer working with an anti-terrorist organization, and falls in love with him. She loses interest in Arpit, and even in her family. When her family find out about Aman, they decide to meet him, and realize that there is no such person as Aman, leaving Anupama to be the only one to vouch for his presence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351145</url></doc>
