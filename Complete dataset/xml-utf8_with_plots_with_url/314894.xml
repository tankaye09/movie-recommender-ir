<plot>Bianca, the beautiful daughter of Rhodes military governor, travels in the San Luca from the Venice Republic to her home in Rhodes, and without her knowledge, the ship also brings secret orders for her father to attack the Mediterranean ports dominated by the Sultan Selim. Dragut, the terrific Mediterranean pirate, attacks and conquers the Sun Luca. The sad knews reach the Governor of Rhodes when he was expelling Diego, an unscrupulous captain, who immediately offers his services to retake the ship, and free the girl. Without alternatives, the Governor accepts, and Diogo enlists as a pirate under the service of Dragut. In his devious mind, once he gets his hands on the plans, he will sell them for good price to Suliman, whom he knows to pay in gold, rather than a polite thank you, as the Governor would do... Indeed, he is able to rob the secret plans from Dragut, but he was so much under the spell of Miriam's beauty, that he decides to take risks, and follow her through the desert to Selim's palace, where she is going to be sold as slave with her young women companions. After a number of adventures, escaping the wooing of beautiful and mean Arab Princess Miriam, and surviving naval battles and desert fights, Diego and the young women are captured by Dragut, and condemned to hang him from the highest mast. Meanwhile, the Governor managed to warn the Venetian navy, who appears just in time to interrupt the proceedings. Diego gets free just in time to defend Bianca, and engage Dragut in a decisive sword duel to the death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?314894</url></doc>
