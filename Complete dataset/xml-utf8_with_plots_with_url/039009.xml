<plot>The life story of one of Britain's funniest and most talented comic actors and writers, who along with Ronnie Corbett created The Two Ronnies, who went onto star in Open All Hours, Porridge and many other hugely successful comic shows. A man who gave up the limelight at the peak of his career to run an antiques shop, and never regretted it. A man who is described in the film by Sir Peter Hall as "one of the greatest actors of his generation, not comic, actor!".</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?039009</url></doc>
