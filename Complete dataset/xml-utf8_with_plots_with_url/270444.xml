<plot>"A painter is at work on a ladder painting the front of a house. A dude who passes by under the ladder tries to flirt with the house girl, whom the painter admires. This is noticed by the painter, who splashes some paint over the dude's clothing. This starts a quarrel, which ends in the falling of the ladder and the covering of the dude with paint."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270444</url></doc>
