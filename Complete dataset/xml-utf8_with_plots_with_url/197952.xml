<plot>Scene on River Street, Paterson, N. J., a few days after the flood in October, 1903. Shows the condition of a street on the high land. Wagon ferries are taking people to and from work. The badly flooded district could not be reached at the time this picture was taken. Photographically good and an excellent scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197952</url></doc>
