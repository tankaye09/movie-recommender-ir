<plot>Meet Gina Ferraro. A sexy, whip-smart, perpetually single feline who has 30 minutes scheduled on her Blackberry to have a nervous breakdown. Where better to purge in obscurity than in a cemetery on a bench next to a passed- out drunk? Lamenting to GOD and demanding that HE send her a boyfriend, GINA is momentarily stunned when the drunk, who's not, sits up and suggests that she should try online dating. Deprived and losing her mind? Yes. Loser? NO. Only desperate losers look for love online. Sitting in mortified anonymity behind her computer screen that very evening, armed with the requisite single and sexless salves; Patron Silver, a pack of Djarums, and three different kinds of Ben and Jerry's, GINA, true to inebriated and satirical form, finally decides on the opening line of her personal ad. "Due to the recent destruction of my vibrator..." At 30, why lie? Welcome to her life</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?650144</url></doc>
