The teams consist of 2 men, a sacker and a bag-man trying to get 10 snakes into burlap sack as fast as possible. Getting bit is inevitable. Guinness World Record holder and snake sacking champion Jackie Bibby &amp; Ken Garret have been the team to beat for over a decade, but the mother/ son sacking team of Bobby Duke and Betty Harris feel like they have been cheated out of the title for all these years. Will they finally come out on top?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282579</url></doc>
