<plot>Sheila has returned to run the family farm after the passing of her estranged father. The bills are mounting as she struggles to provide for herself and her son, Tory. Stan, the local sheriff, and an old friend, tries to convince Sheila to marry him as he attempts to form a bond with recalcitrant Tory. With the wheat crop ripening, and harvest imminent, Wade, Sheila's high-school beau, and the long-absentee father of Tory, unexpectedly returns. As Sheila and Wade attempt to negotiate their past transgressions, Stan's suspicion grows, and tension builds. Tory is caught in the middle as the adult world begins to implode.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222224</url></doc>
