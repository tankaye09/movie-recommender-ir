<plot>A writer and his girlfriend, a painter, go to a Mediterranean island to stay in a country house where, two years ago, seven people were murdered. This is not the first time that these artists have stayed somewhere where terrible crimes were committed, in order to write their books. They call it The Orfeo Method, because it recalls the story of the ancient greek musician, who descends into hell to bring back to life his beloved Euridice. What adventures will they face this time, staying in those chilling places and reliving those events?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?258633</url></doc>
