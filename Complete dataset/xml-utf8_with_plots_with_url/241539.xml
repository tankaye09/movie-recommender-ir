<plot>Leonardo Goldberg arrives to an unknown village in the middle of the mysterious Danish landscape. He is on his way to his new job, an equally undefined type of business. Crossing the forest that leads to the village, he is confronted with a world under dramatic climatic changes. When he arrives, he learns that his predecessor died under unexplainable circumstances. He also receives all the keys to his new office, but he won't be able to open a single door, except -that is- for the exit door that leads back to the forest where he came from. In a parallel world, a pianist is reading the mind of his neighbors, while he plays a familiar tune. These thoughts seem to be connected to the life of Leonardo Goldberg, who has a premonition that his existence is not the mere result of chance, but rather a fragment of abstract poetry. While he tries to solve the puzzle of all these inexplicable events, he will discover that the keys to his office do work. It won't be him, though, who is able to use them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?241539</url></doc>
