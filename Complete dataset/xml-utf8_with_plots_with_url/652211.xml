<plot>A hilarious tale about the mishaps of Kana, a clumsy but loveable bear, his sidekick Fluff Fur Roo, and the family of bees he encounters as he accidentally knocks over their beehive. The bees blame the bear for their troubles and set out to retaliate. Unfortunately, Kana's best friend, Fluff Fur Roo, offers no assistance, leaving him to fend for himself during a lighthearted confrontation with the angry bees.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652211</url></doc>
