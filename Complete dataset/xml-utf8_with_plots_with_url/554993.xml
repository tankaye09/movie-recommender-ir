<plot>In one of the most-used plots of the B-western genre, sometimes officially and sometimes just "borrowed" (see Movie Connections), Sunset Carson is a member of an outlaw gang led by Gil Santos, who have been holding up gold shipments dispatched from Laramie City. Sunset rebels when the gang leaves old Jeff Winters to die alone after he has been wounded in a hold-up gun fight. Sunset and Jeff break with the gang and begin operating on their own, or plan to. On their first attempt, they rout Santos and his gang, and Sally Stoner, daughter of Laramie City Sheriff Frank Stoner, assumes they are honest citizens who just saved the gold shipment. She takes Jeff to a doctor and Sunset is made a deputy sheriff. Shortly afterwards, Santos and his gang pull a robbery and implicate the innocent Sunset, and the aroused townspeople, convinced they have been double-crossed, are ready to shoot Sunset on sight.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?554993</url></doc>
