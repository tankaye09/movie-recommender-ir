<plot>Go behind the stage with the gothic/metal band Type O Negative. See hilarious tounge-in-cheek humor from all 4 members (also has footage of Sal Abruscato). Also see a huge toilet paper fight with the crowd as Pantera plays on stage. You thought these guys were dark and mysterious? Think again and watch their first (and only, to date) video.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?623193</url></doc>
