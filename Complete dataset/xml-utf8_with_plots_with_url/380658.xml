<plot>Student at law Bharti lives a wealthy lifestyle in India along with her widower and blind dad. She is a fan of singer/dancer, Ravi Shankar Singh and attends his music concert. Afterwards she is shocked to see him handcuffed and escorted by the Police. On inquiring, she finds out that Ravi has confessed to killing a man named Rana Singh and is to be hanged soon. Then she attends Ravi's last ever concert, and this is when Ravi abducts and forcibly marries her. After the marriage, Ravi is arrested and produced in Court where the truth finally materializes that Ravi and Bharti had conspired together in order to overturn Ravi's death penalty to life imprisonment. The Court is not convinced and upholds Ravi's death penalty. Watch what impact this has on Ravi, his widowed mother, his former lover, Kalpana, and on Bharti herself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?380658</url></doc>
