<plot>Twenty-year old Trevor has trouble talking about his past: his military father who was never home, the early death of his mother. As he reaches adulthood, he's found a way to be at once a part of the group and distanced from it. His last relationship disintegrated when he wasn't able to communicate and connect. He joins his friends on a trip to the desert to conduct an experiment: creating music from the earth's seismic activity. The only cloud is the unexpected presence of his ex-girlfriend, Haley. The fragmented strands of his life hang about him and he focuses on one thing as being an escape: a new drug called T19 that is "supposed to make people connect." As the sun sets, the music surges to life and the party starts. That night, the drug's effect is more powerful than he could have imagined and throws him into a reunion with his past. He persuades Haley to take T19 as well. When the sun rises the next morning it is to awakened hope and the dawn of the 21st century.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?534421</url></doc>
