<plot>Sue Bancroft, a modern day Dorothy from Rabun Gap Georgia, travels to the Emerald City -New York- to pursue her dream of writing a novel soon meets a cast of characters that only Manhattan can provide, a scarecrow like musician, a cowardly lion bar owner and a tin man who not only finds his heart, but kindles hers as well. Dorothy's witch has nothing on the rich heartless heiress witch who baits Sue into writing a biography about her infamous husband, but at a price that is both tantalizing and ultimately dangerous. "Liars, phonies and wolves, oh my!" Sue frets. She soon learns that that the Big Apple isn't Oz and there is no Wizard and that her Southern values will be sorely tested in the nanosecond, anything goes, gritty streets of Manhattan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?356198</url></doc>
