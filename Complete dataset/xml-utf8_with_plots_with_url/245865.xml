<plot>This is the incredible true story of Philip Stockton, a 40 year old Englishman who aspired to be the first man to sail around the world in a single-handed boat. He enters the race between nine madmen who also want to be heroes. The drama unfolds when Stockton, realizing that he cannot win the race legitimately, decides to fake it. For months Stockton sails the becalmed waters of the South Atlantic known as the "Horse Latitudes" while sending in false navigational reports, supposedly from the Cape of Good Hope of the Indian Ocean, off Australia and near Cape Horn. The five months at sea with no company other than his obsession and conflict drive Stockton mad. HORSE LATITUDES explores Stockton's ordeal and his final solution to his self-imposed state of misery. Gordon Pinset vividly plays Phillip Stockton, as a man walking a tightrope between his dreams of heroism and the frightening reality of his fraud.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245865</url></doc>
