It's difficult for them to adapt to the stifling atmosphere of the women's lodging institute - and to get along with each other due to their differing personalities. Yoo-jin has the most difficulty with the stuffy institute life. she begins to have visions of events that took place at the institute in the past - like the tragic fire that occurred years ago. Yoo-jin gradually becomes consumed with fear, and the relationship among the four intimate friends begins to suffer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?122960</url></doc>
