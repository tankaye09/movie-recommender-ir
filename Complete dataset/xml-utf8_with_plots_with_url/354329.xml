<plot>An exploration of current circumstance that leads to the opposite of the probable conclusion. A conclusion based on morality, decency, and normal human behavior. Human behavior that comes in the form of a modern acceptable definition of a normal character according to the majority of western civilized society. How far can one stretch before one can no longer and must no longer submit to these societal restrictions? The essence, nay the gist of the point is that anti-social, in-humane or rather primal nature in some circumstances will inevitably be released. When the pain of daily life gnaws through ones moral fiber to the point of numbing ones senses. When the mind begins to dull and must be awakened or die; a jolt is needed. And it is at this point that Senor Javier Munoz breached his snapping point thus moving him forward into another form of life that he was and is entirely unprepared for. His life of mediocrity and want has ended. His exploration has begun.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?354329</url></doc>
