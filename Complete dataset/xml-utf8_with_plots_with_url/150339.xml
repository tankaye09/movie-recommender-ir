<plot>Mamta lives a middle-classed lifestyle in Bombay along with widower dad, Ratanmuni Gupta, who works as a Manager with Sharda Chemicals, while she studies in Lovedale College in Manori. Her dad wants her to marry a naive, semi-senile, Munna, the only son of widowed, Sharda, his employer. On the day of the engagement she humiliates her dad, Munna and Sharda and refuses to marry Munna. Shortly thereafter a number of young children die after being injected with medication from Sharda Chemicals, the Police investigate, arrest Sharda, while Munna kills himself. Ratanmuni and his partners, D.S. Mittal, Mehra, Radhey and Shyam, take over Sharda Chemicals and re-name it Friend's Chemicals. Sometime later when Mamta returns from Manori, her dad introduces her to wealthy Mrs. Modi, who wants her to wed her only son, Azad. Both Azad and Mamta approve of each other, meet with each other and get intimate. On the day of their engagement, many surprises await Mamta as she finds out that the man she got intimate with is not the real Azad, while the real Azad and his mom will have nothing to do with a now characterless Mamta.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150339</url></doc>
