<plot>Two years ago, Zohar Wagner, then 34, decided to tear away the cloak of silence that enveloped her bourgeois family. Her mother had a five year affair with a man ten years her junior, and Zohar, at the age of twelve, was an accomplice to the secret. Twenty years after the difficult episode that had torn the family apart, as the Filmmaker's Mother is selling her childhood home, the family gathers and Pandora's Box is opened. The film is called "Zorki," the family nickname for Zohar.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?672175</url></doc>
