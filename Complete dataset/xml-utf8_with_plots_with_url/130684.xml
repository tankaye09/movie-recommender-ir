<plot>Daya lives a poor lifestyle in a village called Yennehole along with his dad, Rama, and mom, Radha. When Rama passes away, the duo re-locate to Bombay where Daya gets a job with the Police as a Sub-Inspector. When a group of terrorists abduct 40 tourists in a bus, Daya seeks permission from his immediate Supervisor, Dinesh Poonacha, but is unable to reach him. He takes the initiative, kills the terrorists and rescues the hostages and becomes a hero. But the I.G. of Police and Dinesh take a different view, and initiate disciplinary action him and ask the Home Minister to decide his fate. Daya presents his case, and the Home Minister instead decides to promote him to Criminal Investigations Unit under Chief Prakash Hegde. This will herald a major change in Daya, his mom, and Spurthi, his future bride's lives, as he will now have the official license to kill anyone he chooses - in the name of the law. Will Daya live up to honest expectations or will he bend the law and execute innocent citizens in fake encounters - amidst mounting pressure from a corrupt system and underworld dons such as Yousuf Khaleel - who have sworn to kill him at any and all costs.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130684</url></doc>
