<plot>Jerry is a man consumed by jealousy. In an attempt to prove his suspicions of his wife's infidelity, Jerry plummets to his death, only to find himself reincarnated-as a parrot in a pet store. When his widow, unaware of his identity, purchases and takes him home, Jerry struggles to reconcile his possessive feelings for his now-single wife with his new status as a household pet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?274750</url></doc>
