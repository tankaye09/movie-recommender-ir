<plot>Rhonda Jo Petty is engaged to Ron Jeremy, but she is afraid to let herself go with him - afraid that her body doesn't look good enough, that she isn't a good lover. Paul arranges for her to do a nude photo session, hoping she will loosen up a little. She does, but a lot more than Paul anticipates! In the second segment, Jeanette James and Kevin Gibson are young marrieds who are having a problem keeping the excitement they once experienced with each other. Kay decides to enroll in an institute for sexual improvement. Howard finds out and decides to look into it. When he does, Howard and Kay live happily ever after.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?130093</url></doc>
