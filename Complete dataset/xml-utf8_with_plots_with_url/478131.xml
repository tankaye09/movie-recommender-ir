<plot>Shekhar lives a poor lifestyle along with his maternal uncle, Dharamdas, his aunt, a cousin, Sita, who is separated from her husband, Mahesh, and also has a sister, Gauri, who had eloped with her lover, and everyone believes is dead. Shekhar studies in college along with wealthy fellow collegian, Bela. Both do not get along, but that changes when her dad comes to know about Shekhar's good character and thinks that he will be a suitable son-in-law. He approaches Dharamdas and arranges their marriage with the condition that Shekhar move in with his family, to which Dharamdas and Shekhar agree. This news is met with displeasure by Bela's mom, who has already arranged her daughter's marriage with Rajan Murari, the son of their trusted employee, Govindram. Despite of this, the marriage does take place and Shekhar moves in, is employed by Thakur, and the family settle down to a fairly harmonious lifestyle. Their idyllic lifestyle is shattered when Bela suspects and then across evidence that Sita and Mahesh, who are now together, have stolen her diamond necklace; that Shekhar is having an affair with a dancing girl; and that he has embezzled ten thousand Rupees and had gone to an undisclosed location for 3 days and refuses to state where he has been to. Things to a heat when Thakur meets with an accident, and subsequently passes away - paving the way for his wife to arrange her daughter's divorce and possibly arrange Shekhar's death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?478131</url></doc>
