<plot>This is a story about a group of individuals who dared to try. It is a story about excellence and limitations, knowledge and imprudence. It is a story about winners and losers. Our story comes to you from behind the scenes where we focus on 12 qualifying chefs from across North America as they aim for top title in the culinary world - Certified Master Chef. Never before in the history of the Certified Master Chef examinations has a film crew ever been invited to attend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199176</url></doc>
