<plot>Mohan lives a poor lifestyle in Bombay along with his dad and mom. One day while returning home, his dad and he get run over by a truck and get hospitalized. He survives, loses his left leg but his dad passes away. His mother makes a living stitching clothes. She enrolls him in St. Andrew's High School, Khar, where he befriends two wealthy youth, Vijay Sharma and Ajay Verma. While both of them like Mohan, they hate each other as their respective fathers are rival businessmen. When Mohan gets them to befriend each other, their dads decide to separate them, with one being grounded and the other being sent to a far-off boarding school. But both friends decide to run away from home - not realizing that soon they will be at the mercy of bandits, venomous scorpions, wild animals, and a ferocious and wounded man-eating tiger.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317673</url></doc>
