<plot>Brenda, in her later years, narrates the story of her youth as the eldest of three kids. Coming from a home of abuse and negligence, we're exposed to scenes from her life as she sifts through memories. Her father, a volcano of a man, and her mother, an over-medicated spiteful woman, both treat her privately as a lesser human being, a slave to be used and abused. But their public life is one of success, a picture of the "American Dream": privately owned business, three kids, and a house in the suburbs. 'Frayed' follows Brenda on a path of silent desperation and destruction to the moment she says her life "began". Inspired by one woman's trials and tribulations as a child in the foster system and other tales of suburban abuse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?202930</url></doc>
