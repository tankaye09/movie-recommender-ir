<plot>Originally started as an evening news magazine for providing in-depth looks at the major stories from around the nation, this show found itself hijacked by what would become America's biggest news story of 1994: The OJ Simpson murder trial, and soon was featuring it a regular part of the weekly news lineup. Also included was a "sound off" segment in which a guest commentator would speak about some topic of their choice, after which viewers could call in from home to make their own opinions on the matter heard.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?034387</url></doc>
