<plot>Monica is a Mexican girl from the barrio. She's humble sweet and with ambitions for something better; but Monica has always set aside her feelings and dreams to help others. Monica is a lame, but professional clown with big girl syndrome. Her sense of humor is terrible and the only reason why people laugh at her, she thinks, is because of her over weight problem. Monica's older brother, Omar, has always gotten into trouble until he landed in jail for theft. Omar, now a freeman returns with his girlfriend and two daughters to start a new life. Monica's best friend, Lily, is a prostitute and her lifestyle leads her into date rape and an unwanted pregnancy. Monica's boyfriend, well actually she doesn't have a boyfriend but she would like it to be Mario. Mario is a used car salesman and with his good looks cheats women for their money. This ensemble of characters has found themselves in the crossroads of life where they need to choose a new path. Maquillaje is a fun and dramatic dark comedy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357146</url></doc>
