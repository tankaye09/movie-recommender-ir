<plot>Two comical looking Germans are engaged in a bologna eating contest. The battle wages hot until one of the Dutchman discovers that his piece of bologna is bad, a trick evidently played on him by his opponent. The contest then ends in a mix up, in which, as usual, the victim gets the worst of it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078238</url></doc>
