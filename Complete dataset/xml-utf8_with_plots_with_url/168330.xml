<plot>Bhagwati Prasad looks after the vast estate of his deceased brother, assisted by his wife, and brother-in-law, Markutey. Bhagwati has got into debt and has been embezzling money in order to pay his debtors. His spoiled and rude niece, Renu, who resides in the United States decides to pay them a visit. Bhagwati welcomes her and makes her feel at home, but Renu is not easily satisfied until she gets a speed boat so that she can be on her own. Alerted by her lawyer, she starts to scrutinize recent transactions and finds 15 lakh rupees missing. She asks Bhagwati to provide her with an explanation within 2 days. Then she gets into her speed boat, only to get involved in an accident, planned by Bhagwati,and disappears. Bhagwati is all set to take over the estate, when the estate's lawyer gets a Court Order freezing all the cash, bank, and assets until such time Renu is found or her body is located. The months go by, Bhagwati hires men to look for Renu, and they soon find her and lead him to her. Bhagwati finds out that she has lost her memory, and is living with a man named Raja and three children. This time Bhagwati will make sure that she will not escape alive, even if it means to kill Raja and the three children as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?168330</url></doc>
