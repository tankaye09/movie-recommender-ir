<plot>"A Mock Senate Satire Comedy..." the first card at once conveys the tone and subject of the following film; it is both a parody of the old Mack Sennet Star Comedy logo and a signal that a political satire follows. Employing dialogue from several of his short films, The Fatal Glass of Fields is a celebration of the comedic genius of W.C. Fields and a glorification of the elegance of his era. Our stop-motion film uses this backdrop to parody many of the aspects of this year's presidential election and it ultimately ends in typical Fieldsian fashion: his immediate and deserved comeuppance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?557034</url></doc>
