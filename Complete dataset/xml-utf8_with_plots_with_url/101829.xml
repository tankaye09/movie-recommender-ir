<plot>Chercher la Vie ("Looking tor Life") introduces the viewer to two women, Anne-Rose and Rosemène, who each have their own particular way of battling through life. The former makes lunches in a factory yard in Port-au-Prince and sells her meals to the factory workers; the latter is employed in the same factory as a production worker making pullovers and T-shirts. Every day she buys her midday meal on credit from Anne-Rose. Through the connection between these two women the film reveals part of their daily work and the constant battle for survival that they lead together with other women in Haiti. Going beyond this, however the film shows at first hand the extent to which importing of North American goods has brought about the collapse of Haitian regional production and ruined Haiti's economic circumstances. The connection between these two concerns of the film, which at first glance may not necessarily seem related, reveals the significant role that Haitian women of today play in an economy that has been bled dry.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?101829</url></doc>
