<plot>On a Sunday evening in June, 1991, Teresa Fargason, says she took her 6-year old daughter, to a grocery store in Macon, Georgia. According to Teresa, a few minutes later, she realized that Taylor was missing and she began searching the store. With no sign of her daughter, Teresa became frantic and asked an employee for help. The police were called in and, about an hour later... Taylor was found dead by the side of a road in a rural area about 6 miles away from the store. The investigation dragged on and, over a year later, the police announced that, finally, they had a suspect... Teresa Fargason. When it was all over, Teresa was found guilty of murdering her own daughter and she was sentenced to life in prison. To this day, Fargason insists that she's innocent and is the victim of a police department coverup meant to protect one of their own -- a former Macon cop -- who Fargason says is the real killer. If Teresa's claims are true, then an innocent woman is behind bars and a child killer is out walking the streets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?602580</url></doc>
