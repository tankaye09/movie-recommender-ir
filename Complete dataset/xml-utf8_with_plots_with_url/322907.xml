<plot>The scene opens in a wizard's cavern, showing an inanimate figure resting against a table. The wizard with some mysterious passes converts her into a living woman, and after laying her on some trestles and covering her over with a large sheet of paper, saws her in halves. Taking the two cones of paper he places them on separate tables, when, on being removed, they disclose two ladies in the place of the one who has been cut in half. From the same receptacle he then proceeds to materialize six other beautiful damsels, who, after performing a mazy dance, vanish into thin air. The two maidens that remain are then duplicated and put through the most amazing complications, being merged into one person, and again duplicated; finally, however, they walk to the front of the stage together with the wizard, and, after bowing to the spectators, withdraw.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?322907</url></doc>
