<plot>Chevrolet presents this look at dogs and their many varieties. We see a collie herd sheep, we watch a German shepherd provide safe navigation for a blind man, we see greyhounds and huskies, children with pets, and dressed-up women with canine companions. The narrator observes that nature hasn't yet made a dog that combines economy, speed, and power. We watch seven boys build a wooden car that they and six dogs pull along. Then, we look at the modern automobile, one that does combine all the elements we want in one vehicle.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?031203</url></doc>
