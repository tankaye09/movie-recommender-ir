<plot>"Africa is not only a continent of war and crisis. There is also an Africa that is alive and well, and is often borne by women" Odile Sorgho-Moulinier (United Nations) Culture is no longer a static body of knowledge, values, practices and expressions shared and passed on by a community. It is a dynamic reality. "The Power of Art / Women's Voices in Africa" explores how contemporary African women who choose to be professional artists claim their position, and deal with the stereotypes associated with being an African and a woman. The film also focuses on the role professional artists may play in addressing the challenges women are faced with on the African continent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?583510</url></doc>
