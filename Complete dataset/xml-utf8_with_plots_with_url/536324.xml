<plot>If Terry Fox walked into a doctor's office today his outcome would be much different from 25 years ago, he probably wouldn't die and he might not even lose his leg. Terry had a dream to raise money for cancer research. The new science that is his legacy has begun to deliver real results. Meet a Toronto woman who survived the same cancer as Terry and who walks today on two healthy legs; a little girl from Botswana whose life was saved by a pioneering medical procedure; and a cancer survivor in Cuba who lost his leg but still runs every year to keep the Marathon of Hope alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?536324</url></doc>
