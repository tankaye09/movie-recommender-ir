Then one day management decides to shake things up by making some changes in the company that will cause a change in everyone's lifestyle. The environment changes from hopeful to possible disaster and financial ruin for many of them. For some failure is not new or can deal with it, but for others failure is imminent and something they can't deal with. One worker commits suicide just before Christmas.
