<plot>Aaron Driscoll loves everything about California. He writes high concept action scripts that have the potential to become blockbusters. There's only one problem. Well, two problems. No one's ever heard of him. And it's been years since he's lived in L.A. 'First Chance I Get' is the story of Aaron's most recent attempt to shake up his life and return to Hollywood to pursue his dream. At a typical, monotonous party outside Boston, Massachusetts, he meets Jamie Marcus, a young, confident woman who takes an instant liking to Aaron's quirky charm. Aaron could stay in Boston and get to know Jamie, or, he could buy that plane ticket to L.A. once and for all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?195847</url></doc>
