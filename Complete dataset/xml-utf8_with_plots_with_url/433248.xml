<plot>The Pink Panther is in his apartment, gift-wrapping a basketball. The ball drops through the wrapping paper to the floor, bounces out a window, and knocks a pointy-nosed, little man in a lower-level apartment off of his balcony swimming pool diving board and down to the street, where the Pink Panther catches him. The Pink Panther chases the bouncing basketball into a zoo, where an ostrich mistakes the ball for an egg and fights the panther for possession of it. The ball bounces away and becomes the plaything of two seals, with the Pink Panther trying to intercept their tossing of the ball. The ball resumes its meandering and leads the Pink Panther on a chase into the wig section of a department store, then bounces near a volleyball court and falls in love with a volleyball- but balks at marriage and returns to the Pink Panther, who resumes his chase of the elusive, bouncing ball with a mind of its own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?433248</url></doc>
