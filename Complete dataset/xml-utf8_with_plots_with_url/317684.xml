<plot>A raw, bare portrayal of the reality of national independent cinema with the story of how Quarta B (2005) was made as main theme. The previous feature by director Marcelo Galvão was produced with only R thousand and was voted by the public Best Film in the 29th Mostra. Each and every day is shown over the course of the four-year uphill battle to produce the feature. In spite of the somewhat hopeless starting point, the documentary provides a good-humored version of the drama the team were up against, interspersed by statements from important persons in Brazilian cinema such as Fernando Meirelles, Ugo Giorgetti, José Eduardo Belmonte, Alexandre Stockler, and Theodoro Fontes. As professionals, they set forth their own experiences and difficulties with the feature that is being produced as reference.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?317684</url></doc>
