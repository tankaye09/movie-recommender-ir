<plot>Living a poor lifestyle with his widowed mother, Kalicharan, gets in the bad books of wealthy Mukesh. First he falls in love with Mukesh's glamorous daughter, Suman, and then he opposes Mukesh's men who want to demolish some huts. They eventually kill him and his spirit ends up in Yam Lok, where he is told that his death was a mistake. He is transported to the body of a dying male, Balwant, who was poisoned by his paternal uncle, Kashiram. Re-born, Kalicharan sets out to teach Kashiram a lesson, and gets used to his new widowed mother, as well as sweetheart, Gauri. When his recollection returns, he returns home to Suman and his biological mother - setting off a chain of uncontrollable events.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?023627</url></doc>
