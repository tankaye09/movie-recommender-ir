<plot>In "Unveiling", poet-turned-painter Mahvash Mossaed narrates her emergence from the crucible of womanhood with a poignant blend of artwork, poetry, and candid commentary. We meet the Tehran-born Mahvash as an aspiring poet who leaves her home and literary aspirations behind to undertake a new life abroad. After marrying a man whose career brings the couple to locales as disparate as Canada, Europe and Africa, she finds her voice once again in painting. The canvasses capture both the intensity and the subtleties of Mahvash's journey through experiences of intoxicating love, bitter disappointment, and a looming sense of depersonalization. This film depicts themes both personal and universal to all Eastern and Western women as Mahvash guides us through her metamorphosis into a woman of strength and authenticity.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?632621</url></doc>
