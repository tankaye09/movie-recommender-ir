<plot>Alexander Cross is a ruthless, unscrupulous individual, devoid of conscience or ethics. He is involved in activities that are not exactly legal. He is a notorious womanizer, who doesn't care if they are married, and usually uses them for one thing or another. When this habit of his catches the ire of one of his associates, he is killed. However, a group of people who have been burned by Cross, have kept his death a secret and have found a man named Jim who's the spitting image of him. They want Jim to take Alex's place and get into his inner sanctum so that they correct the wrongs he has done and would have done if he was still alive. However, there is one problem, another one Alexander Cross' quirks, is that he is a health freak, that means that he's a teetotaler and a vegetarian. And Jim is a strong drinker and a meat lover.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?575503</url></doc>
