<plot>Curtis (Daniel Sauli) lies in bed, housebound with a badly broken leg in a ramshackle Brooklyn walk-up. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Lola (Cordelia Reynolds), is getting ready for a night out. She tells Curtis that she's seeing her mother and some family friends, while Curtis, jealous and insecure, wants her to stay in. As it turns out, Lola is headed to dinner with Alan (Dean Wareham), a well-known novelist and notorious ladies' man. As the night goes on, Lola continues to test the boundaries of fidelity, and ends up finding herself in over her head.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340490</url></doc>
