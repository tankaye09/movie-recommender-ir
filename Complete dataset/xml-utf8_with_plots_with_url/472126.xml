<plot>Based on a true event... In 1973 Nasa launched the Pioneer 11 spacecraft to investigate our planetary system. In 1995 NASA lost contact with the space probe when it reached the outer limits of our solar system. Power level was insufficient to operate any experiments and barring incident, Pioneer 11 was expected to pass one of the stars in the Aquila constellation; in approximately 4 million years. S.e.t.i. begins with the Pioneer crashing onto a distant earth-like planet. The craft is discovered by one of its inhabitants exploring a forbidden zone. Fearing possible contamination, the colony decide to hold the man in quarantine until the source of the wreckage is identified. Paranoia and inquisition begin to tear the society apart. In an attempt to uncover the origin of this foreign object, their primitive technology malfunctions and chaos ensues. Suspicion can destroy if the leaders decide to take the path of least resistance.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?472126</url></doc>
