<plot>Twenty years ago, Earl Piatowski walked out on his wife, Puppy. They were in love, but he was restless; he left her for the independence, opportunity and romance of a life on the road among our towns and highways. Now, one sale away from a lifetime achievement award, he Ã­s assigned the same small town where he and Puppy married, and even though he has been in thousands of towns just like this one, Earl isn't immune to the emotional implications. Few people are as lucky, or as unlucky, to witness what their lives would have been had they made different decisions Earl &amp; Puppy takes this journey, explores the consequences of Earl's choice and pursues ideals like independence and achievement which so deeply influenced his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164251</url></doc>
