<plot>In an excavation in Saudi Arabia, professor Albert Wombot discovers an ancient object of mysterious origins, and hidden within is a powerful secret. After his discovery the professor is brutally murdered and the secret of his mysterious object seems lost forever. Sean Barrister, a former protégé of the late professor, finds himself struggling to hold a job in the aftermath of the dot com bust. One evening, shortly after the murder of the professor, Sean meets a beautiful woman named Christine who seems strangely attracted to him. The very same evening Sean is also approached by a man named Miklos, who is interested in hiring Sean to help him find the object that the professor had discovered. Sean finds himself compelled by Miklos's offer and begins a journey into the last days of the professor's life. Following the clues left behind Sean, Miklo's, and Christine forge an unlikely team trying to discover the secret of the hidden object. But what Sean does not know is that Miklo's has a dark secret of his own, he is a vampire, and his journey through immortality lies in the hands of Sean and the discovery of the professors secret.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569145</url></doc>
