<plot>Every Sunday morning for over three years, the Santa Barbara chapter of the Veterans for Peace has been putting up a war memorial on the beach. They place a white cross for each soldier who has died in Iraq, laid out like a mock-graveyard. This documentary is about this war memorial and the people who visit it. Many of these visitors come to see a specific cross for a friend or relative. Others merely stumble across it. They knew the casualties were numerous, but they did not feel the enormity of it until they saw Arlington West for themselves.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017983</url></doc>
