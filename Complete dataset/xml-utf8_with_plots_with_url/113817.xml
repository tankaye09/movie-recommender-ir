<plot>What if there was a chemical substance, a pill simply called Mem, secretly derived by an ethno-pharmacologist from an herb found in India, which allowed you to abandon the present and re-experience any event of your choosing with all of your five senses . . . the happiest, the sexiest, and possibly the most dangerous events from your past? Rewind your life! Sift through your memories like programs on TIVO, playing back only those that suit you - courtesy of one very powerful and harmless-looking little pill.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?113817</url></doc>
