<plot>Oxygen Network-revival of the classic celebrity panel game show, whose main differences (including host Miller's stand-up routine and the living room-esque set) complemented a game that remained faithful to the classic CBS game. As before, panelists tried to identify a contestant's (or group of contestants') secret, whispered in Miller's ear and announced to the television and in-studio audience. Each panelist had one 30-second period to ask the contestant(s) questions in an attempt to guess the secret; for each celebrity who cannot guess the secret within their own questioning period, the contestant(s) was/were paid $200, or $1,000 if all four could not guess the secret. The contestant(s) usually got to demonstrate the skill or show a video associated with the secret. During the final segment of each show, a celebrity guest would announce his/her own secret, usually associated with a specific skill or talent. This version of "Secret" represented one of veteran host Steve Allen's last television appearances; he was guest host during one of Miller's absences in 2000.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255127</url></doc>
