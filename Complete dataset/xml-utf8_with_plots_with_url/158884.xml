<plot>Brutally beaten by Frieza, Goku attempts to perform his last attack: The Spirit Bomb. The Spirit Bomb is a collection of energy that can be drawn from all living matter on a planet. Once the creator is finished, it is then shaped into a massive sphere of energy, which is then thrown at an opponent. Unfortunately, Frieza and his evil warriors have eradicated almost all life on the planet Namek! Goku now must collect energy from other planets, which takes a tremendous amount of time and concentration. Meaning that Goku must stand still with his arms in the air until it is complete. In episode 77, a very patient Frieza is also standing still, waiting, and puzzled to why Goku is motionless with his hands in the air. But how much longer will Frieza be patient? If he notices the Spirit Bomb, Frieza will instantly kill Goku! Piccolo, Krillan, and Gohan watch in fear from a distance knowing they are powerless to aid Earth's last hope. Keep in mind that Frieza could kill Goku at any time he wants but this sadistic fiend is enjoying himself watching Goku suffer. Will his evil fun prove to be his undoing?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158884</url></doc>
