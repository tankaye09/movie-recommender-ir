<plot>A witty as well as fact-filled compilation of short films intended to convince lesbians of the need for and the fun of safe sex. It begins with facts about sexually transmitted disease, and it includes commercials for and dramatizations of the use of water-based lubricants, latex gloves, condoms, and dental dams. An excerpt from a panel discussion of British researchers and health professionals is balance by a send up of a television health report that takes the viewer playfully through ten favorite sexual activities, from kissing to bondage.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?491715</url></doc>
