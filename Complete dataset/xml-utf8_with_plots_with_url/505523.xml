<plot>"Solve for X" is a glimpse into the life of a true anti-hero. He's a man with no name. After years of killing for "The Man," X races against the clock to find out who wants him dead, while swimming in the political corruption, crime, broken dreams, and filth of the underworld. What ever happens, the score will be settled. Lost in a world of dead end feelings and claustrophobic lies, you pay for the choices you've made. With all of the trappings of a gritty crime action/thriller, "Solve for X" will take audiences on a ride they are sure not to forget.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?505523</url></doc>
