<plot>The UH-1 Huey, the most widely used military helicopter in the world, began to arrive in Vietnam in 1963. Before the conflict ended, more than 5,000 of these versatile aircraft were employed in Southeast Asia. The copters were used for a variety of purposes, including MedEvac, command and control, air assault, transport of personnel and material, and as gun ships. From the three-part series Wings Over Vietnam comes an in-depth look at the role this aircraft played in Vietnam and how it came to symbolize the war itself. Meet the commanders of this military legend and hear gripping stories of the special breed of men who piloted Huey. Companion videos in the set include Wings Vietnam: A-4 Skyhawk and Wings Vietnam: F-105 Thunderchief.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658029</url></doc>
