<plot>The film unfolds the reality in a communist country in the 1970s through the eyes and wise ways of an ordinary gypsy. The events take place in a small town in Albania. Besides the well-organized civilized life, a strange Gypsy community is settled in the town. The calm flow of their life is troubled by the birth of a child. The son, who is the ninth child in this Gypsy family, will bring joy not only to his family, but to the entire gypsy community. What could possibly trouble the strong communist establishment of the time? A child is born but not an ordinary one. His name is Mao Tse Tung. A gypsy Mao Tse Tung in the 1970s.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357063</url></doc>
