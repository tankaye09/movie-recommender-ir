<plot>Mubarak is a young Afghan refugee who can't go home again. While he spends his days working in a slaughterhouse in Young, Australia, he spends his evenings and free times with a friendly local family. Molly is the daughter of the family and the two form a close bond. When Mubarak falls in love with Molly the situation becomes more difficult, adding to Mubarak's stress of trying to extend his visa so that he won't have to return to a probable bad fate in Afghanistan.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?374664</url></doc>
