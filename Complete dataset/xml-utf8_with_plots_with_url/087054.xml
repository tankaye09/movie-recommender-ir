The beginnings of an awkward relationship develop through beer-assisted conversations about cooking, travel, and the importance of satisfactory toilet visits. Common, everyday events lead the two men to open up about their lives. When Burke's much loved grandmother dies, his already fragile state is put under serious strain. Burke financially benefits from his grandmother's death which irrevocably changes his trajectory, shattering his fragile sense of stability and self. Burke's downfall inspires Wills to re-think his life and ultimately leads him to adopt a more conventional path. From this point, Burke and Wills' relationship splinters, and the two withdraw into worlds of their own where the other becomes the enemy.
