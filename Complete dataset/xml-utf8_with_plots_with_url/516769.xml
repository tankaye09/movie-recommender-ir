<plot>Genuine Pictures of the Ruined City of St. Pierre, Mt. Pelee Smoking, Fort de France and Other Historical Scenes Incidental to the Great Calamity. Our staff photographers returned from Martinique on the steamship "Korona," and brought with them a complete series of typical and genuine Martinique films, which, when exhibited in connection with our Mt. Pelee films, makes a complete entertainment in themselves. Our photographers were dispatched to the scene of the disaster immediately after the news reached this country, and during the following two months succeeded in procuring a set of motion picture negatives that are of extraordinary interest and rare photographic excellence. The film "Storm at Sea, Near St. Pierre, Martinique," is the finest sea storm picture that we have ever produced. In other respects the films are unique, being the only genuine motion pictures ever made of scenes following a volcanic eruption of such magnitude. This picture gives a good idea of how the sea must have rolled on the morning of May 8th, 1902, when St. Pierre was blotted out of existence. The waves dash across the deck continuously. The finest storm picture ever made.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?516769</url></doc>
