<plot>Dane and Luthor are best friends, inseparable. Finished high school two years ago and with college nowhere in sight, they are stuck in the cycle. Dead-end, humiliating jobs, video games and dreams of their big break. Usually shunned by the popular kids, Dane and Luthor lie themselves into a party invitation, under the pretense of being in a band and promising to provide the entertainment. But there's a problem, neither of them listens to music, much less knows how to play anything more complicated then a "Guitar Hero" game controller. Their quest is complicated by the introduction of variably by the likes of Russian mafia, a hot female country singer, and a high-as-a-kite CD store operator who runs his shop like a Navy battleship. Do they have what it takes to pull it off?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?504257</url></doc>
