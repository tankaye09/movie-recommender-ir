<plot>From the moment of her birth in a rural black hospital in Georgia, Lena McPherson is recognized by all the nurses as a special child, one with the power to see ghosts and predict the future. Only Nurse Bloom knows the spells to ensure that the child will see benevolent spirits, not evil ones, but she hasn't bargained for Lena's mother, who scoffs at 'old time ideas' and discreetly disposes of the special tea the nurse has brewed. No ill effects are immediately apparent to Lena's relatives in their spacious house on the prosperous side of town. But early on there are signs of trouble, and Lena is prey to suspicions no one else need consider: a new face may be a new kid in town-or a face from the grave. From a special little girl, Lena grows into an especially fearful adolescent. Ultimately, she must accept that those she loves can give her love and nothing more and that she must find her own, uncertain way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054791</url></doc>
