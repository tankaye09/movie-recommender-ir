The man actually distributes drugs around the city, the Tough cop Inspector Vishal (Arbaaz Khan) arrives in the city and starts trailing Hero whom he suspects to be involved in the racket. But the poor unsuspecting Hero is innocent. So when he stumbles upon the truth, Khanna has him bumped off. At the same time, he manages to shoot Vishal in the heart. A heart transplant takes place and Hero's heart is given to Vishal. Hero's spirit comes back to avenge his death, but only Vishal can see him.
