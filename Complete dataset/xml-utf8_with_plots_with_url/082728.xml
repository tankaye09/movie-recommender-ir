<plot>Poul Jaeger is an old man enjoying the last of his years in solitude. One day he receives a letter addressed to an, for him, unknown woman, Anna. In curiosity he opens the letter. It contains a key and strangely enough it fits a locked door in Poul's apartment. Adventuring the room Poul slowly starts to remember things from old photographs and clothing. Suddenly Poul finds a small box with pills with his name on it. These are used against Alzheimerz. Remembering this Poul finally remembers Anna, his deceased wife, and how he daily posts a letter with the key so that he can find the room and remember her. In that way he keeps his love for her alive.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082728</url></doc>
