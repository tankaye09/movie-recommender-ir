<plot>Shankar Verma lives a poor lifestyle with his mom, Shanti, in India after His father, Sathpal, leaves the family for a courtesan by the name of Meenabai. Years later, Shankar has now grown up and finds himself the object of affection of two beautiful women, Sunita - who is wealthy and is the daughter of Bhanu Pratap Singh, and Madhu - who is poor and lives with her parents, Hariya and Tara. Both women think that Shankar is in love with them. Shankar is hired by a wealthy woman named Amita who wants him to spy on Bhanu Pratap, his sons, Balram and Jackie, and his partner, Kedar. Shankar goes on this task and reports his findings to Amita regularly. One day while talking to villagers, he finds out that his dad had a bad reputation and had not only betrayed Bhanu Pratap, but had also killed Bhanu's brother, Shashi. His inquiries take him to Central Jail so that he could speak with his dad, but on arrival, he is told that his dad passed away six years ago. Shankar then sets out to find out the whereabouts of Meenabai, but her brothel had caught fire and no one knows her whereabouts. Little does Shankar know that Meenabai is still alive in the shape and form of none other than Amita - and is using Shankar as a tool to extract vengeance against Bhanu Pratap!!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?271699</url></doc>
