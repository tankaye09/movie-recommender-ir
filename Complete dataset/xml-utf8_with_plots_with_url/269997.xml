<plot>Three individuals struggle to survive in this stand off drama involving faith and enlightenment. When Andrew hired Reza for the overnight position at the gas station he manages, he had no idea that training him would be the longest night of his life. As the mundane night drags on, Chris, a disgruntled soldier, interrupts the routine by pointing a gun in Andrew's face and demanding money from the register. Momentarily distracted, Chris finds himself staring down the barrel of a shotgun with Reza as his hostage. Will faith prevent these two men from squeezing their triggers? With the sun on its way up will there be a shot fired before IT RISES FROM THE EAST.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269997</url></doc>
