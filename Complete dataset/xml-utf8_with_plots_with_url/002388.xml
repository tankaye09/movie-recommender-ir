<plot>What people fear most about dying is being in pain. And there is good cause for this fear, because a large percentage of Americans die in terrible and unnecessary pain. Latrice Warren understands this well. She is a registered nurse at the University Medical Trauma Center and has been taking care of her ailing father for the past three months. He is suffering from Prostate Cancer and lived the best life a man could ever live. We examine the effects of losing a love one to a disease that is common among American men.</plot><plot>What people fear most about dying is being in pain.
