<plot>Hooligan is hard at work, sawing wood. A sign on the shutter reads: --"No. 71, Mrs. Marshall, Laundress. Samples in this window. Closed Sunday after 11 A.M." Hooligan stops sawing and knocks on the shutter, and the sign on the closed half read as follows: "I shall undress in this window Sunday A.M." Hooligan sees the point and frantically calls to the passerby. A policeman hustles him off.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?245185</url></doc>
