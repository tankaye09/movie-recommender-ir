<plot>After traveling and working in Africa, Chloe Chick, a native Australian, witnessed extraordinary hardship and wanted to help. She held a fund raiser to address three peak issues affecting Africa: environmental degradation, lack of formal education, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Chloe formed a team of ten women from Australia and the U.S and presented them with a monumental challenge: climb three of Africa's highest peaks in just three weeks. With little climbing experience, the women attempt to summit Mount Kenya, Mount Meru, and Mount Kilimanjaro, and to spend time with their chosen charities. After paying their own way to take part in the challenging climbs, the team discovers a passion for the development and success of their charities and the people behind them.</plot><plot>After traveling and working in Africa, Chloe Chick, a native Australian, witnessed extraordinary hardship and wanted to help.
