<plot>A woman lies in bed, while someone under the covers pleasures her. Her partner, another woman, emerges, smiling, continuing with caresses while the first woman, through body language, expresses that she's finished. The first asks the second about her first man: it was junior prom with a boy who committed suicide after graduation. They talk about him at length, actually arguing somewhat about her reaction to his death. Then, as they finish dressing, the first woman discloses details of her first time. They exit the bedroom to noises in the living room. What gives?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424495</url></doc>
