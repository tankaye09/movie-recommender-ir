<plot>During the late 70's, there was a brief resurgence of nostalgia for the 60's tunes of the Beatles. Since the fab four themselves had no interest in getting back together, a stage production called Beatlemania toured around the country with four actor/singers performing the Beatles' greatest hits. This TV movie takes a behind-the-scenes look at the work that went into bringing the Beatles back to life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?573794</url></doc>
