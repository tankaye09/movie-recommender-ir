<plot>Ever think that your best friend's girlfriend isn't the most attractive of people? Ever suspect that your own girlfriend could be cheating on you? Ever wonder if the voice in your head might be lying to you? Meet Jeff, Flint and Gray. Though he never has a shortage of advice to unload on his friends, Jeff finds it hard to help himself when he discovers the infidelities of his girlfriend and his mother on the same day. To make matters worse, Jeff's best friend Flint picks that day to move in with him after recently being dumped. After vowing never to date again, Flint meets Sophie, a girl he can actually get serious about, and who is somehow impressed with his career as a children's birthday party clown. But Jeff knows something about Sophie's past that could lead Flint to doubt his own feelings. All the while, Gray is desperately trying to find his place in life, becoming fearful of his girlfriend's impending success in the art world, and taking adult education courses like 'Become a Psychic.' Gray has no idea where his life is headed. This dialogue-driven relationship comedy asks the question: What happens when we stop listening to the advice of our friends, and have no desire to listen to our own? You tell me. You Tell Me: a comedy about trusting yourself (and other relationship mistakes).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?666530</url></doc>
