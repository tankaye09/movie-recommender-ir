<plot>Young and successful Ali from Istanbul leaves the big city to go search for a lucrative piece of land on a sparsely populated island. Unfortunately he is immediately confronted with problems: "No Ferry Today" says a handwritten piece of paper at the gates of the port. In his hurry to somehow get to the island he meets an old fisherman called Memo. Ali offers Memo money to take him to the island, but Memo is satisfied with a cigarette. But since Memo is the captain, he decides the pace of the boat and thus paces the hectic Ali down as well as the story. The differences between the two men seem to be huge at first sight, but when you depend on one another, huge differences become tiny.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?257191</url></doc>
