<plot>The President is seen on the reviewing stand at the Stadium, escorted by President Milburn, of the Pan-American Exposition, Secretary Cortelyou, and other noted persons. He removes his silk hat as the troops march by and politely bows to the great audience as they cheer and encore. President McKinley and party form the left foreground of our picture while the troops march by in the right foreground. From this excellent position we thus secured perfect pictures of both the Executive and his troops.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?442794</url></doc>
