<plot>Approaching the end of his life, an old man has all but lost his grip on reality. He lives alone, with no evidence of ever having had a family. In a state of confusion he goes back to his old job, repeatedly, only to be roughly turned away each time. On his walk home one day he stumbles across a young woman's badly deteriorated diary. He brings it home and finds comfort in its simple, superficial musings, which plunge him into a dream world. Coinciding with its discovery is a rapid change in his isolated, confused world as everything in his life disappears, until all that is left are the diary's contents, and all traces of his ever having existed are totally erased.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253331</url></doc>
