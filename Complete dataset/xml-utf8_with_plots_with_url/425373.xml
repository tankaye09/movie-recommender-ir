<plot>Pilate is seen here, as the picture opens, seated upon his throne. Christ, still in the hands of the infuriated mob, is dragged before this hater of the Jewish leaders, who would, if possible, release Him. The action here shows that Pilate unwillingly sentences Jesus. He washes his hands saying: "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye to it." The populace then revile Jesus, crown Him with thorns and array Him in "gorgeous apparel." He is dragged off for the crucifixion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425373</url></doc>
