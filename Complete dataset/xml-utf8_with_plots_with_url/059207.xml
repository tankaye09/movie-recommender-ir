<plot>Barberland is a rich and humorous portrayal of a community phenomenon that is quickly fading into our vanishing Americana. Through quirky tales told by the barbers who were there, we are taken back to a time when a good shave and haircut made all the difference in your day, and people meant more than money. From shaving mishaps to Playboy Magazine, a trip through Barberland is a journey to be experienced before it's gone.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?059207</url></doc>
