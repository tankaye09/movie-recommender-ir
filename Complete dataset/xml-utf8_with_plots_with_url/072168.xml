<plot>Bits and Pieces confronts distorted perceptions of Jordanians in particular and Arabs in general, to understand and document the realities of one of the Middle East's most quickly developing nations. Covering over two dozen interviews with men and women of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. From these conversations certain inescapable truths emerged, including Jordan's place in the world; the impact of globalization; the complexity of being Muslim; homosexuality and tolerance; the hatta (traditional headdress) and its association with terrorism; what it means to be Palestinian; the desire for peace; and the need for understanding between cultures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072168</url></doc>
