<plot>Darcy is a quirky, young bride-to-be getting ready on her wedding day. Although her friends and family outwardly support her, each has an objection to the match. Darcy's parents are already planning the annulment, her stoned bridesmaids are amused, the preacher has to be bribed, and it's all driving her sister up a wall. Only her hairdresser considers her love "brave," and he's probably just trying to keep her business. Somehow the wedding comes together, and as Darcy looks her true love in the eyes, she knows this is the best she can do.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126916</url></doc>
