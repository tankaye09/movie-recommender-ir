<plot>Citlalli is a girl of about eight. She's going to a new school, the only child who doesn't speak English. At recess, she plays jacks by herself, but three kids tease her. That night, she says a prayer to Our Lady of Guadalupe and then cries herself to sleep. Our Lady speaks to her that night, and Citlalli awakes wrapped in the Virgin's shawl. The girl is now delighted to go to school, but when the bullies strike again, what will she do?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?107354</url></doc>
