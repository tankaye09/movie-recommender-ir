<plot>In this SNES sequel to the arcade R-Type space-shooters, you are the R-9, Earth's most advanced form of defense against the evil Bydo Empire. There are seven stages you must go through, picking up the usual power-up items to defeat the stage bosses which have returned from the arcade versions of R-Type and R-Type II. Your R-9 ship can also be united with Force, which are invincible units that surround your ship to protect you, power up and also attack.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?522311</url></doc>
