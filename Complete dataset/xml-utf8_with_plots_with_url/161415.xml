<plot>Dud's girlfriend Mamie wants an ice cream cone, but Dud is broke. He rushes home and steals a coin bank then chops it open with an ax, only to find that he's also split in half the one coin inside. Dud's mother sees this and spanks him. That night, Dud takes his dog and runs away into the woods. He imagines his mother finding him the next morning, weeping and reproaching herself for being so hard on him. Then he imagines finding buried treasure. These fantasies become nightmarish when he thinks he sees a bear, a demon and a laughing skull. It's morning now, and Dud returns home with his dog, only to suffer another spanking from his mother. The dog says, "Guess I might as well start training for what's coming to me," and hits his own behind several times on a fence.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?161415</url></doc>
