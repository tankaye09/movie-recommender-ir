The hero puts the gun under the floorboards of the porch, where it remains until very near the end of the movie. Upon investigating the poaching, he uncovers a horrifying poaching ring run by a man from Hong Kong who is paying the locals a couple of thousand dollars per deer and using bits of the animals for Oriental medicines.

The hero's daughter shows up and complicates matters. The confrontation escalates and people around the hero begin to die. He decides to take revenge. After his daughter is killed, he breaks out the gun under the porch...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?074305</url></doc>
