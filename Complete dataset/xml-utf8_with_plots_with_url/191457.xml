<plot>Feasibility Study starts with the main character Martin getting laid off from his job. The following morning he is left with a lot to think about but nothing to do. He stands above his kitchen stove and begins to day dream and what follows illustrates his mixed emotions from being fired from a job he disliked. We follow him back to his office in his day dream where numerous surreal events transpire. Martin finds himself in a mental loop dealing with inadequacy and ego.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?191457</url></doc>
