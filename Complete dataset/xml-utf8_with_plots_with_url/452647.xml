<plot>Another short in which modern (1953) Hollywood turns a buck by chopping up and making a burlesque of silent films via projection at the wrong speed, selective editing, changed titles and snitty commentary. This one has two segments; "Crossroads of Life" or "Father to the Rescue" where a father is horrified at the though of his daughters becoming actresses; and the second is a edited William S. Hart film---called "The Fandango" or "The Fate or an Ornery Varmint" here---in which a dancing girl tosses gambler Hart a rose and tips him off he is being cheated in a card game. Hart shoots the "ornery varmint" doing the cheating and rides out of town with the girl with the sheriff in pursuit. They are ambushed by Indians and both die with Hart clutching the rose tossed to him by the girl.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?452647</url></doc>
