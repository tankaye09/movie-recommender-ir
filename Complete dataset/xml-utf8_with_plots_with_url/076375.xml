<plot>Jay is a high-school student, a loner and misfit, who thinks about life and death and God and a mark on the wall across from where he sits on the floor during lunch period. Jay has figured out that everyone will die, meaning that his interactions with those around him are all he has to give life meaning; but he's not good at connecting. Kids stop to ask him how he's doing. Is suicide his only option?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?076375</url></doc>
