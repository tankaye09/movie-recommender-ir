<plot>The Last Bang explores a loving but tumultuous relationship between a grandson and his grandfather. One morning, grandfather, Max Solomon, 88 years old, invites his grandson, Benjamin Pinter, 29 years old to his apartment for a talk. To Benjamin's surprise and revolt, the conversation turns bizarre when Max asks Benjamin if he'll be a good grandson and take him to an escort agency for the last time. Benjamin, who feels he'd be disrespecting his grandmother if he appeased his grandfather's request, tells Max a firm no. After a feeble attempt on Benjamin's part to offer an alternative to his grandfather's objection, he eventually succumbs to Max's request. Max's relentless pursuit of his "LAST BANG" and Benjamin's neurotic, morally conflicted perspective merge for the conclusion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?569189</url></doc>
