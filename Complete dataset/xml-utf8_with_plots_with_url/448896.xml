<plot>Pushing Up Daisies delves into the world of American funeral directors, revealing the rarely witnessed behind-the-scenes action of the death care industry. It takes an intimate look into the daily lives of two very different funeral directors: Ronald L. Jones, a flamboyant, philosophical man in urban St. Louis, lured into the business by the big cars, fancy suits and rumors of riches; and Peter Burla, an austere, down-to-earth man in Ironwood, Michigan, who views his one-man operation as a chance to earn a modest, respectable living. Pushing Up Daisies follows these men through their daily tasks of embalming and restorative artwork to their delicate interaction with the deceased's family during the funeral arrangement process. Examining the lives and work of these professionals gives an insight into the heart of our culture-how celebrate lives that have been lived.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?448896</url></doc>
