<plot>The main drama is set in Hyderabad. For this purpose, a huge and expensive set against Charminar backdrop was erected. Hero Ajay (Mahesh Babu) lives in one of the houses there. He has his own entry into the house, through a trap door, to avoid being noticed by his disciplinarian police officer father (Mukhesh Rishi) and mischievous younger sister (Niharika). His mother (Geetha) is kind and affectionate. Ajay is a kabaddi champion and goes to Kurnool to take part in a tournament. He meets Swapna (Bhoomika Chawla) and rescues her from the clutches of Obul Reddy (Prakash Raj). He then brings her to Hyderabad and takes her to his room through the trap door. And she continues to stay there without anyone's knowledge, blending among the many dolls in his room whenever anyone comes visiting Ajay. Ajay's priorities now are to get a passport and visa for Swapna so that she can move away to the US and then to win the national Kabaddi title for his team. He wins the title but fails to send her abroad, as Swapna refuses to leave him and go. How she becomes completely free of Obul Reddy to be with Ajay forms the rest of the story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?409137</url></doc>
