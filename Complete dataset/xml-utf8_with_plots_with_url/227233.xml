<plot>Eli Pettifog is a 14-year old with a raging superiority complex, who has been raised by his single drunken mother.  When his yearning ambition to attend Harvard is thwarted, he must make do with Whitman College, the "37th Best Small College in America."  Eli's roommate is 38-year old freshman Leo Searly. Having gambled away a self-made fortune, Leo is  retrenching and fulfilling a life-long dream of a missed classical education.  Their relationship develops into an unorthodox but endearing father-son bond. Eli decides the best way to avenge his rejection by Harvard is to commandeer Whitman's college bowl team and take them all the way to the finals - against inevitable powerhouse Harvard. </plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?227233</url></doc>
