<plot>In 1986, Brian Keenan, an English Literature professor from Belfast, Northern Ireland, decided to take a break from his native city. He took up a position in the American University in Beirut, Lebanon. Scarcely two weeks after his arrival, he was kidnapped by fundamentalist Muslims and was subsequently imprisoned in a solitary confinement compression chamber, six feet long and four feet wide. "On the floor was a foam mattress. With the mattress laid out I had a pacing stage of little more than a foot's width." Brian was to spend much of his five years incarceration in this windowless tomb. 'Music' is by turns harrowing and inspirational. Deprived of even the most basic human needs, and in an increasingly hopeless situation, Brian's mind began to unhinge - however, it wasn't until his flights of imagination began to blur the margins between fantasy and reality that his despair began to take real hold on him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?205136</url></doc>
