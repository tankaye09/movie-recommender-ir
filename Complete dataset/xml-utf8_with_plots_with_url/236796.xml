<plot>Eighteen year-old Keira's afternoon in bed is interrupted by a phone call from her semi-estranged adoptive mother. She is nonchalantly informed that her biological grandfather has asked to meet her and her twin brother, Gabe. Keira, always certain she never wanted any part of her biological family, is dumbfounded to learn Gabe is ready and eager to meet their dying grandfather. Keira is then forced to confront her feelings towards her biological family while having to reconnect with her divorced, adoptive parents, who have started new lives with their own children. In the events that lead to Keira's difficult decision, she contemplates the foundation of love: is loving an ability one is born with or is it a trait one is taught?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?236796</url></doc>
