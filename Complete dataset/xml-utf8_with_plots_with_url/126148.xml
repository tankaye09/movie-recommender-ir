<plot>President Kennedy served just three years in office, but they were three of the most difficult years of any presidency. The United States was locked in a global power struggle with the Soviet Union. Dangers included the threat of nuclear war, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and growing racial tension in the South. While many considered the Kennedy family to live in "Camelot," Peter Jennings takes a rather hostile look at the life of JFK, including allegations of mob ties, a secret war against Fidel Castro, endless encounters with women, and many opportunities for blackmail. Retired Secret Service agents speak about what went on behind closed doors. Former CIA agents, former reporters, and an alleged former lover also describe the "dangerous world" of JFK.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?126148</url></doc>
