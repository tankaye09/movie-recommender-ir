<plot>When It Was Blue is a live, ephemeral film performance and an ode to a beautiful and unspoiled natural environment which is fast diminishing. When It Was Blue rejoices the splendor of the natural world through a complex and dazzling fusion of textural, abstract hand-painted images projected onto filmed landscapes from Iceland, New Zealand and Vancouver to Pyramid Lake, Nevada and upstate New York.16mm double-projected film and montage by Jennifer Reeves Music by Sk√∫i Sverrisson with Anthony Burr &amp; Ted Reichman.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?652918</url></doc>
