<plot>Cheyenne finds a strange book mixed with a bunch of old magazines. It's "The Adventures of Sweet Gwen" by John Willie, a classic adult comic book full of villains, damsels-in-distress and bondage. Cheyenne has never seen the book before and neither has her roommate who doesn't know where it came from. The two intrepid adventures decide to have a s√©ance to try to contact the ghost of the dead bondage cartoonist. Their efforts seem to be fruitless, but later that night, it appears their ghostly exhortations have some unexpected results.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?592522</url></doc>
