<plot>In the twenty years since his death, 'Eric Morecambe' (qv)'s private study had not been entered by anyone, not even his family. Now, his family have finally given permission for documentary makers to enter the place where Eric did all his work and where he forbade anyone else to enter, and many fascinating records of his life have been uncovered. These include many letters, tape recordings, diary entries, and a video recording of the father-of-the-bride speech he gave at his daughter's wedding. This documentary tells the life of one of the most celebrated comedians of all time with the help of these new-found treasures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?598328</url></doc>
