<plot>"Warrior" is an elimination tournament to determine which man in China posses the strength, speed, endurance and dexterity to become "Warrior". Using grueling physical and mental challenges 56 men in, four regional bouts, are eliminated down to 4 warriors. These 4 warriors prepare for the final battle to determine which one of them can lay claim to being "Warrior". Shot on location in fair and foul weather, challenges will utilize all natural elements such as mountains, trees and water to set the stage for each episode. Rocks, logs, bow and arrow, axe and spear are some of the primitive weapons used to test the abilities of the challengers. Do you have what it takes?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?665983</url></doc>
