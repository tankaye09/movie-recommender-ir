<plot>A journey to tell the story of the one true "bug of history" - the periodical cicada. This mind-boggling insect lives underground for 17 years and then emerges in the billions only to die off in about a month. The bug can only be found in the eastern half of the United States and the filmmakers, despite their serious aversion to bugs, set out to capture this phenomenon as it occurred in 2004. During the process, the filmmakers themselves become educated about these creatures as they meet various interesting characters, including individuals who are too afraid to even touch a picture of the bug, as well as others who happily eat them by the dozens.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?084210</url></doc>
