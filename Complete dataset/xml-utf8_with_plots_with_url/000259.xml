<plot>HALLOWEEN: UNMASKED 2000 attempts to unravel the mystery behind one of the most successful horror series of all time: HALLOWEEN. Dee Snider narrates this mini-documentary that features exclusive interviews with the cast and crew of the original movie, as well as some conversations with those involved in the sequels. A wide range of topics is discussed, from conception to to filming to distribution, all tempered with some light-hearted humor by the men (and women) behind the mask.</plot><plot>HALLOWEEN: UNMASKED 2000 attempts to unravel the mystery behind one of the most successful horror series of all time: HALLOWEEN.
