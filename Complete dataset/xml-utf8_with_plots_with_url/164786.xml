<plot>In this tale about a Chinese immigrant family, the distinct worlds of men and women are exposed and examined through subtle comparisons. Throughout the film, there are the repeated presence of opposites, of calm and chaos, of peace and invasion, of love and selfishness, of the outside world and the home. The title 'eat rice' also has an added meaning. Rice, the staple in the Chinese diet, is a generic term for meal in the Chinese language. It is the metaphoric anchor that soothes, comforts and stabilizes. It suggests peace and tranquility, a tone that is present throughout this piece.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164786</url></doc>
