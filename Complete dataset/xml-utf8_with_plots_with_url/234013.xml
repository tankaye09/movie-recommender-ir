<plot>Heera lives in a small rural town in India with his father, a Magistrate, and housewife mother. He meets with the town's moneylender Dhaniram's daughter, Asha, both of them fall in love, and hope to get married soon. Before that could happen, Changu's daughter is killed, and the police are notified. They find evidence at the scene of the crime, and link it to Heera. As a result Heera is arrested, held in prison, tried in Court, found guilty, and sentenced to be hanged. Heera protests, pleading his innocence, but all in vain, as no one believes him, including his very own dad. In prison, Heera escapes and runs off into the ravines and it is from here emerges a new Heera - a bandit - who is cold-hearted, ruthless, and will not hesitate to kill anyone - his only goal in life is to clear his name, by finding the real killers - that is if they and the police, who have launched a manhunt for him, give him enough time to do so.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?234013</url></doc>
