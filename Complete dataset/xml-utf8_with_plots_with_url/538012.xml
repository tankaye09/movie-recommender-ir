<plot>A 1999 English family volunteers to spend three months in a restored Victorian house, which recreates life for the middle class of 1900. The family must wear period clothes, and not use any conveniences or products that was not available to a family of their class in 1900. The camera follows the members about as they struggle with trying to get enough hot water for a bath, create their own shampoo, raise chickens in the backyard, and (the women, at least) deal with constricting garments.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?538012</url></doc>
