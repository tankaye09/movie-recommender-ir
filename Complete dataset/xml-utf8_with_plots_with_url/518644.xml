<plot>In August of 2007, director David Palmer set off on a journey with avant-garde photographer Greg Friedler to capture his shooting of the fourth and final book in his critically acclaimed "Naked" series - for the first time in color, in the only city in the world that is synonymous with the term "strip": Las Vegas. Starting from scratch with no confirmed subjects nor a location to shoot at, Friedler and Palmer embarked on a multi-dimensional and highly emotional 30 day roller-coaster that eventually brought together 173 naked human beings of every shape, size, and walk of life into a single white room with a red curtain to open themselves up to Friedler, Palmer and eventually the world. STRIPPED is a no holds barred behind the curtain exploration which follows Friedler's own personal search into the underbelly of Las Vegas to capture its wide array, and at times bizarre, denizens who when stripped of clothing and society's judgments in front of his lens discover an even playing field of beauty, humanity and ultimately self love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?518644</url></doc>
