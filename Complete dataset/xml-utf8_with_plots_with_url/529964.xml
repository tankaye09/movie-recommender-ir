<plot>The evil Black Knight storms into the King of England's castle. He throws down his glove, and dares any of the King's champions to pick it up. Edward, the King's clumsy servant, enters the room, sees the glove on the floor, and picks it up. The King proclaims, "We have found our champion!" All kinds of jousting misadventure ensues. Edward awkwardly climbs aboard a horse only to find he's facing the horse's tail! He clicks, "Hiya!", before choosing a weapon. He also gets into a separate battle with an uncooperative helmet and visor. Can this loveable little clutz really triumph over the Black Knight, or will he wind up flat on his back? Find out in THE TALES OF THE GALLANT KNIGHT!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?529964</url></doc>
