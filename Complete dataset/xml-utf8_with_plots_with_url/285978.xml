<plot>Sunil lives a middle-classed lifestyle in a village in India along with his widowed mom, Janki. He is studying Medicine in the city, is in love with his childhood sweetheart, Shanta, and everyone expects them to get married soon. However, Janki does not approve of Shanta, finds her uncouth and illiterate, and instead approves of Shobha and arranges Sunil's marriage with her. Shanta's mom, Parvati, falls seriously ill so much so that Sunil returns home, promises to wed her daughter, and she passes away. Sunil returns to the city to continue and finish his studies. After sometime he becomes a fully qualified doctor and returns to the village to open his own dispensary. It is here that he will learn that Shanta is now married to the wealthiest man in the village, Lakshmipati, who is not only a widower, father of a deceased child, but also much older than Shanta. Watch what happens when an embittered Sunil confronts Shanta to find out why she betrayed him and their promise to her late mom.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?285978</url></doc>
