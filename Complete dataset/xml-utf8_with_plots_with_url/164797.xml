<plot>Played against this setting is an on again off again stormy relationship between Guy known for his tough street tactics and fiery temper and a distraught Winslett who is trying to cope with the sudden suicide of her beloved daughter Joy. The suicide leaves Winslett vulnerable to again fall into Guy's criminal outrage causing a ripple in small town Tumwater, WA. Pursuing Winslett back to "the dark side" Guy uses her as his pawn and into his distorted realities of scoring The Big Jewelry Heist. Eventually she is led into a series of betrayals. The hellish night becomes more warped as an unsuspecting kidnapped real estate broker named Lindsay is forced, in a "Patty Hearst" kind of way to become a part of the gang and is forced into committing a robbery which goes awry and culminates into a homicide. Ultimately each person fights to stay alive, as they find themselves locked in life-or-death struggles.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?164797</url></doc>
