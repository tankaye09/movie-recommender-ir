<plot>Flying, with an eye on the skies, the ground and the horizon line in between, which clearly separates light and dark and provides navigators with a reference for both the heavens and Earth. This is the story of Nilton and Fernando, who work as pilots in Amazonia, a film about flying as a dream and a passion, a job and a fate. Nilton and Fernando live this reality, on a tightrope between a longing for freedom from Earth's gravity and the attraction of flying as a way to make a living in Amazonia. Two first-class flyers who can take off from land or water, hoboes of the air. Their paths cross for a week when they join forces as the pilot and copilot of a Cessna Centurion and become the victims of a dramatic, do-or-die kidnapping attempt.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197605</url></doc>
