<plot>Shows a man on the corner of one of Chicago's prominent streets whistling for a newsboy. Well, before he called no boys were in sight, but before he can lower his hands he wonders where they sprang from. Such pulling and tossing for the job for the paper. The poor man is sorry he needed a paper. Makes a great picture. Nothing in sight but boys and papers. Try this and make y9our audience smile at an everyday Chicago street merchant scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?087576</url></doc>
