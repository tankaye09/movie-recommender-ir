<plot>Tkaronto is a reflective and provoking exploration of two Aboriginal 30-somethings, Ray and Jolene, who make an unexpected connection at the pinnacle of a common struggle: to stake claim to their urban aboriginal identity. Ray Morin, A MÃ©tis writer, is in Tkaronto (the original Mohawk word for "Toronto") to pitch his TV series, Indian Jones. This looks to be his big break. The only problem is Ray's growing disdain for TV execs who are more motivated by ticking off the Aboriginal box and tapping into "hot" Aboriginal funding than they are genuinely interested in the project itself. Ray feels caught between a rock and a hard place as his non-aboriginal wife puts the pressure on for him to take the job. Jolene Peltier, an Anishnabe painter, is in Tkaronto conducting interviews for a series of portraits on prominent Aboriginal people. When Elder Max Cardinal gives her an eagle feather and sweetgrass, it confirms her deep-seated feeling that she should walk a spiritual path. But can walking this path mean the end of her relationship with her husband who seems utterly disinterested in Jolene's newfound spiritual calling? For Ray and Jolene, home feels very far away. And having this chance meeting with each other only raises a difficult question: would their questions of identity be answered if they were together?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?609625</url></doc>
