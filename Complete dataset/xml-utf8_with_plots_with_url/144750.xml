<plot>Tabitha Knight lives a very peculiar life. A child of foster care who has grown into an attractive and ambitious adult, she now finds solace, excitement, and security in the company of rich and famous men whom she dates as a discreet and charming groupie. Everyone wants to be loved. Tabitha understands that. She shares her gifts with those who seek and, perhaps, need love the mostly male celebrities. She remains anonymous by changing her name, age, and address as often as she changes the men she dates. Only a few things remain constant in her life: the continued love and support of her foster sisters in Seattle and the record she keeps of her life in her secret diary.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144750</url></doc>
