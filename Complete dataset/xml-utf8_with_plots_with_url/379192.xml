<plot>Here's one equal, if not better, than "The Rube at the Moving Picture Show." The moving picture operator has his kinetoscope setting in the gallery of the theatre, and he arrives at the show somewhat the worse for liquor. He places the reel of film on the machine and threads it up, and attempts to give a performance, but the audience finds it difficult to follow him, the subjects changing in such rapid succession upon the screen, not one of them lasting more than two or three seconds. In fact, the operator is badly mixed, much to the disgust of "the gang" in the gallery. They begin pelting him with peanuts, fruit and other missiles. The operator protests, and imagines he can "lick" everyone in the crowd. The scene ends by four or five of the gallery gods seizing the refractory operator and throwing him head foremost over the rail into the orchestra. They then throw his machine after him. This picture is a winner.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?379192</url></doc>
