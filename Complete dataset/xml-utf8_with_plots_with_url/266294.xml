<plot>Synopsis Trilogy meets tragedy when Annie Long tracks down Sue Carlson, the missing link from her youthful past. Sue, who commands a flourishing career, answers the call as she has voids in her personal life especially with the fact she is going through a divorce. Agreeing to relive their Ivy League "Sweater Girls" bond of days gone by, Annie coaxes Sue into her web of deception. However, Annie has clung too far and intensely tries to act out some of those dangerous adolescent fantasies. Sue continues to be led into the abyss of the nightmare and must overcome personal short comings to put an end to the hellish evening. She reinforces the fact that sometimes it is better to leave the past where it was.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266294</url></doc>
