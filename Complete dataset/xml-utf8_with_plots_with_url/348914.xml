<plot>A man and a woman talk with each other as they ride the train each day. Though we see the man get on and off the train, the woman seems to forever be riding to some unknown destination. After riding and talking together for many days, the pair has an argument, and the next day the woman is nowhere to be found. As he rides, the man receives an email message on his portable phone containing a character he's never seen before. He shows the message to other passengers on the train, but none of them can decipher what it says.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?348914</url></doc>
