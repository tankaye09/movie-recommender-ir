<plot>In 1971 she was 'wanted' for political murder, because she had assassinated a Bolivian Colonel, who represented the oppressive military dictatorship in the South American country. In 1973 she was ambushed and shot by the police forces led by the notorious Klaus Barbie, former Gestapo chief in Lyons, France - see also _Hôtel Terminus (1988)_ (qv). Monika had tried to abduct him to bring him to France and have him accused for his crimes. Who was Monika Ertl, who is said to have met Ernesto Che Guevara? The documentary follows her traces, interviewing her family as well as her former fellow combatants.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?213217</url></doc>
