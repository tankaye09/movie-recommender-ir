<plot>This film begins with the idea that families have the right to see one another and that U.S. citizens have the constitutional right to go where they please, arguing that such travel strengthens family ties, fosters cultural exchange and builds understanding. Nonetheless, the film explains, over the last 30 years, anti-Castro activists have engaged in violent intimidation tactics of beatings, political assassinations, and the bombing of businesses and even a plane to prevent the expansion of U.S. travel to Cuba.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?203354</url></doc>
