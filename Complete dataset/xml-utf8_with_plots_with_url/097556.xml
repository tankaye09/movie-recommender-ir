<plot>What happens when we unintentionally let our disguises replace who we really are? A man with seemingly nothing to hide walks into a mysterious room for a discussion with an anonymous voice about the fate of a woman, Cecily. Tension mounts and we learn that the relationship between the witness and Cecily is not as innocent as it would seem. It soon becomes apparent that the intentions of the interviewer are not in the interest of gaining information on Cecily. The psyche of a desperate man is exhibited as the interviewer pokes and prods at the witness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?097556</url></doc>
