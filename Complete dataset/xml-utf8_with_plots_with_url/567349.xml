<plot>Johnny, disowned by his fanatical born again Christian family due to his choices in life and love, as well as wardrobe and accessories, left Fresno and built himself a good life in Santa Cruz. With a devoted girlfriend, a job he loves, good friends, good herb, and good times, he has finally become the man he always knew he was meant to be. When his sister Ellen leaves a brief phone message letting him know their mother died, Johnny, against the wishes of his girlfriend, decides they will attend the funeral. Uninvited, they brave Fresno, the Bible and Ellen's casserole in one last attempt to inspire them to Love Thy Brother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567349</url></doc>
