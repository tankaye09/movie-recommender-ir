<plot>Ben Resella wants to sell a screenplay. Not an unusual dream, but Ben has already "made it" once in Hollywood. For decades he worked on movie sets as a scenic designer and painter in the Philippines and found his way into Hollywood. But that never kept him from his dream of writing. Even though he's never so much as pitched a story to anyone, he's determined to try and sell his a screenplay. He will not be denied his chance. His last chance. Ben is 91 years old.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280009</url></doc>
