<plot>Rajan "Raju" Khanna lives with his elderly father, Nihalchand, mom, and a younger sister. He studies Arts in college, and has a sweetheart in fellow-collegian, Neena Bakshi. When Rajan graduates, his father wants him to work at the very same firm he is employed in, but Rajan wants to join the military. His father opposes this, has a heart attack, and Rajan accepts the job offer, and goes to work in his father's office. He does not do too well, his father passes away, and he joins the military. When he returns, nothing is the same anymore, Neena is engaged to be married to a rich and handsome young doctor, and her dad refuses to even consider Rajan as his son-in-law. Disheartened, he returns back to the military, into the war zone. Then he volunteers to rescue a senior military officer, does get through enemy lines, and finds out to his shock that the senior military officer is none other than Major Bakshi. Both Bakshi and Rajan know that it will only be one of them who can make it safely back to their base.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020668</url></doc>
