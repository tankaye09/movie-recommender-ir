<plot>Karan (Sonu Sood) loves Sneha (Tanushree Dutta), but is too much of an introvert to ever express his feelings to her. Although Karan's feelings are evident to many, he is content in just seeing Sneha smile, and never gathers the courage to tell her how he feels. Vicky (Emraan Hashmi) tries to talk him out of his relationship with Sneha, but Vicky assures him that this time, he is really in love with Sneha. Karan's childhood friend. Very different from Karan, Vicky is an extrovert and a notorious flirt. All three lives change when Vicky joins Karan and Sneha in college, and Sneha begins feeling drawn towards Vicky. Karan feels he has lost the only woman he has ever loved but knows he cannot do anything about it. However, life goes on, and the three of them share a special bond of friendship. The closeness between Vicky and Sneha cross all boundaries, and just as everything seems set between the two, one eventful night shatters their bond.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020690</url></doc>
