<plot>No suits, no fancy offices, no limos - forget everything you've heard about sports agents. Joe Flanagan started representing football players 10 years ago with no experience and no money, building his company into a top 20 firm, but it's come with a heavy price... Now, at 37 with a wife and young kids in Green Bay, he's spending 80 days a year on the road recruiting players - a pace he can't maintain. But this year's draft could change everything - that is, if it goes his way... But these players are different and Joe is changing - deep bonds form and lines begin to blur between client and friend, calculated business and blind hope. Can he still trust his own judgment? The Call takes a candid look at the most crucial period in the life of an NFL hopeful and the most grueling part of the job for any agent - the harsh reality that all the training, preparation and pain comes down to a draft day phone call that may never come.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?547058</url></doc>
