<plot>Following the successful revivals of its celebrity panel-type game shows, Goodson-Todman produced a new weekly version of another of its successful panel shows, "I've Got a Secret." As with its CBS predecessor, this weekly version saw a four-member celebrity panel try to guess a contestant's (or group of contestants') secret; the secret, which was whispered in host Allen's ear, also was announced to the television and in-studio audience. Each panelist had one 30-second period to ask the contestant(s) questions in an attempt to guess the secret; for each celebrity who cannot guess the secret within their own questioning period, the contestant(s) was/were paid $20, up to a maximum of $80 if all four could not guess the secret. The contestant(s) usually got to demonstrate the skill or show a film clip associated with the secret. During the final segment of each show, a celebrity guest would announce his/her own secret, usually associated with a specific skill or talent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255125</url></doc>
