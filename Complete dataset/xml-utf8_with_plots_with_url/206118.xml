<plot>A mockumentary about strange events which occurred in Tokyo one Autumn when hundreds of Japanese people claimed they had bizarre encounters with eccentric, three foot tall creatures. Through dozens of interviews Gureamu residents tell their stories and we slowly develop a picture of six small wooden men dressed in expensive suits, behaving with the characteristics of suave criminals and engaging in some kind of murky business in the immense economic capital. We discover that The Yamanunchi Bank was broken into, these little men were seen making a swift getaway in a helicopter and that the Japanese police and media are extremely guarded about the issue. Despite this official silence the creatures have become the stuff of whispers and urban legend in Gureamu - many now believing they were puppets from an old children's puppet theatre threatened with closure, pulling off a heist in a last ditch attempt to save their beloved home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?206118</url></doc>
