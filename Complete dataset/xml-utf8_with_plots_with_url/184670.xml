<plot>On October 11, 2001, two FDNY officers uncover a video camera in the rubble of the World Trade Center. The camera has a name etched into its body-the name of a passenger on United Airlines flight 175, the plane that hit the South Tower. How did the camera survive? Was it with the passenger inside the cabin? Has the tape survived? What's on the tape? Emergency meetings convene among the government's top officials to determine if there is any visual evidence of the tragedy on the video tape. A technician is able to extract about four minutes of corrupted, digitally scrambled visual information from the tape. The video chronicles numerous moments of the life of one American family-a surviving testimonial to the value of human life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?184670</url></doc>
