<plot>A boy is up a tree in the Park, where a number of persons are passing by, when a young lady seats herself directly beneath the tree. Young man happens along and flirts with the girl. He finally seats himself by her side and they become communicative. The lad in the tree is anxious "to learn how it is done," and goes further out on the limb. By this time the lovers are embracing and the boy, not wishing to lose any of it, climbs out too far and the limb breaks, throwing him to the ground, frightening the man and his lady friend, who both fall over backwards, and a great scramble takes place before they can get up again. The photography is excellent.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081113</url></doc>
