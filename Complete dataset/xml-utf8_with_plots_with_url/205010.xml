<plot>From One Rose explores the history of Portland and the Portland Rose Festival as experienced through the eyes of a fictional narrator whose family life intertwines with both. The film is an epic story in which the great events of the century -- women's suffrage, Prohibition, two World Wars, the Vanport Flood, the tumults of the '60s -- are experienced close-up, with the Rose Festival serving as an annual respite in the hard routines of life. From One Rose is a handsome and intelligent film that explores the intricate ways in which history affects communities and individuals at one and the same time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?205010</url></doc>
