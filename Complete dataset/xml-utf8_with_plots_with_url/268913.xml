In the meantime Gigi, who is Isa's partner, awaits the kidnapper's phone call at Rino Marcelli's house. Lina Wertmuller talk's to Mimmo Liguoro about Isa. Moscato finds out about the kidnapping while doing some shopping. Mico Galdieri explains his plans to an assistant about cloning, Doctor De Omnibus voiced many arguments including, Cloning and about the Genetically Modified Organisms.
