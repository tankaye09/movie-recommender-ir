<plot>These comical fellows will make you laugh from start to finish. One is dressed in clothes suitable for a hobo, while the other is neatly attired with fancy shirt waist and knee breeches and low shoes. The better dressed one performs some marvelous acrobatic stunts and the bum endeavors to imitate him. He fails, however, and falls each time to the floor in all positions, each one funnier than the other. Pure fun is witnessed in this picture and creates merriment for all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?341853</url></doc>
