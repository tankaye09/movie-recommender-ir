<plot>With their candy colored skittle rims, banana yellow paint and metallic foil wrapped wheels, Scraper Bikes are the newest green, social movement sweeping the Bay Area. Scraper Bikes are born out of the candy coated Scraper cars with fantastical rims, a product of Hyphy rap movement. Even better, these bikes go green! and help kids get exercise while also improving the environment. Headed up by Oakland activist Tony Coleman and rapper Champ, Scraper Bikes are quickly becoming a new art form and green movement. In this next pod, we'll show you the secrets of building these one-of-a-kind bikes and see why 2008 design theme is candy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?481825</url></doc>
