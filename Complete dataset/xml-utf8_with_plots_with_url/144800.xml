<plot>Manny Puig is profiled in his television special, as the Floridian hand-feeds bull sharks, swims with makos, and introduces us to his good friend, a lemon shark. The remarkable thing about Puig and his relation to the sharks is the fact that he refuses to use cages, or wear armor or repellent, when swimming with sharks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?144800</url></doc>
