<plot>The challenge and opportunity of work in air transportation. The film goes through aviation industry job categories starting with workers on the ground: in offices, dispatching, and radio; meteorologists, mechanics, general maintenance, and cargo handlers. Then, it's on to the flight crew: hostesses, women who are single, in good health, from 5'2" to 5'6" tall, from 21 to 28 years of age, and of normal weight. It ends with pilots. For most jobs, the narrator informs us of the training and certification required. The narration also references small companies, getting one's start in the armed forces, and how to get more information from various sources.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?027071</url></doc>
