After Percy rescues Madison from the unwanted attention of two bullies, they knock his bicycle off the road with their truck, and he ends up crashing in the forest. When he comes to, he is confronted by a new friend, Bigfoot, an eight-foot-tall creature, who has been displaced by a recent forest fire. Since his parents do not believe his story, Percy decides he has to look after Bigfoot.
