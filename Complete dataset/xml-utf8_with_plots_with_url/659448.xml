<plot>"My night" is a weekly entertainment talk show. It invites guests to the host's loft as the main presentation format. From the newest stars to the modest award winning director; from the artists who move away from mainland to Hong Kong for work to the famous Chinese KongFu masters in Hollywood; from unremitting campus theater lovers to the creative team of a hot modern drama; from the passionate singers to the dignified dub experts; "My Night" guests come from the worlds of art and culture such as the music, movie &amp; TV, drama, literature and dance. Host Dong Kefei, who began his career as a film actor, uses his highly infectious performances and humorous conversation to lead guests to their full entertainment potential, bringing audiences the best stories from on the stage and behind the scenes.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659448</url></doc>
