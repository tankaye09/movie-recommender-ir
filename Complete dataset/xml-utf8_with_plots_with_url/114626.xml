<plot>This is the story about what it really means to win. Follow the 23 members of the University of Michigan's Solar Car Team as they struggle to overcome a devastating crash just minutes into their bid to win the World Solar Challenge. Follow their valiant efforts to rebuild a destroyed car overnight, put that car back on the dangerous stretch of road known as the Stuart Highway, and pass 24 other cars in a race of speed, brains, endurance and sheer will. More than eight hours behind the leading cars in the race, Michigan refuses to give up, and in so doing, learns what it takes to be champions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?114626</url></doc>
