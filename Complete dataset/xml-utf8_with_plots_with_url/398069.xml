<plot>"No Excuses" chronicles the United States Disabled Ski Team's historic 2002 season, culminating in their quest for gold at the first Winter Paralympic Games ever hosted in the United States. Racing in Europe, Canada and the United States during their three-month World Cup season, the 22 American athletes on the team strive to win their fourth straight Nations Cup. Then, during nine days of competition at the Salt Lake Paralympics, these paralyzed, amputee and visually-impaired skiers race at speeds up to 70 mph on the Olympic race courses -- seeking to capture both individual glory and the most medals of the 36 nations competing in the games. More importantly, they hope to win further acceptance as world-class athletes and fierce competitors. "No Excuses" captures the individual struggle of athletic endeavor, a team fighting to remain the best in the world, and an honest acknowledgment of ongoing grief without the sentiment and pity all-too-common in media coverage of the disabled.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398069</url></doc>
