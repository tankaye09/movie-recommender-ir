<plot>A man in a suit is sprawled on the floor of an office. Colleagues help him to his feet. The next morning, he remembers his name (Shiode) and where he works, but he doesn't remember yesterday. That evening, he adjusts his camera to take photographs automatically and leaves a sign on his suit - "take this camera to work." For several days, while the camera makes a record, Shiode rises, leaves his apartment block, takes the train, works at his computer station, buys food at a convenience store, and eats at home. He has the photographs developed, and all is revealed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?474574</url></doc>
