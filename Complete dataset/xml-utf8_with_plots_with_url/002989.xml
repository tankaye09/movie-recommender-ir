<plot>Based on a true story from the film "SALUTE". 1968 is the follow up feature drama to Matt Norman's International award winning documentary feature "SALUTE". This film reminds us what it was to live through 1968 in Mexico and The United States. Racism, Poverty, and War were all part of this incredible year. A Civil war began in the streets of the United States when Martin Luther King Jr was killed. The year was full of turmoil and what followed was the making of a year that will be held in history as one of the most violent and horrifying in history around the World. This is the story of that year... 1968.</plot><plot>Based on a true story from the film "SALUTE". 1968 is the follow up feature drama to Matt Norman's International award winning documentary feature "SALUTE".
