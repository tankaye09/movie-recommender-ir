<plot>Dez is a vinyl-collecting, Vespa-riding mod who runs a local record shop. With bills climbing high, and not being able to pay the rent, Stan, his Potato-chip-collecting best friend offers him the perfect solution. He stumbles across a deal of a lifetime that will make both of them rich over night; he wants to buy a stack of vintage movie posters from someone who doesn't know the value of them, with the intention of reselling the posters, and making a fortune. They reluctantly borrow money from Stan's brother-in-law, Jep, who already owes money to two malicious loan sharks. This "too good to pass up" money making opportunity spells trouble for everyone involved when it gets swiped from under them. These two friends discover who they really are and what they are capable of doing when things go awry.</plot><plot>Dez is a vinyl-collecting, Vespa-riding mod who runs a local record shop.
