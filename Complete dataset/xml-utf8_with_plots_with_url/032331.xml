<plot>Almost Home rescues the real stories of aging from an exile of denial. A stunningly intimate documentary shot on location in a nursing home, Almost Home tells the unflinchingly honest stories of couples both bonded and divided by disability and dementia, children torn between caring for their parents and caring for their children, nursing assistants doing unsavory work for poverty wages, healthy elders fearful of moving to the dreaded nursing home, and a visionary nursing home director committed to transforming his century-old hospital-like institution into a true home.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032331</url></doc>
