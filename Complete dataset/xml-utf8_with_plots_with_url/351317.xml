<plot>"Mother" tells the story of Mariana, a maths professor at the Exact Sciences College, who, at 38 and tired of her fair share of romantic failures, decides to have a child on her own. In order to do it, she researches the possible alternatives - insemination procedures from a sperm bank, asking a friend for a 'favor'... And decides that the best option is to find three candidates to have intercourse with without revealing her goal. From her analytical perspective, she thinks this is the best way to do it, in spite of the ethical dilemma which lying to three men implies. She concludes that a future is better than any other option.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?351317</url></doc>
