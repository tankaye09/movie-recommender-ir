<plot>Squirrel Ginger Nutt is showing his girlfriend Hazel how he'd save her from any peril. Some other woodland creatures see this, and decide to have some fun with him, using a scary-looking hollow stump to pose as a fearsome dragon. Ginger is initially frightened into his home (as is Hazel), but goes back out to face the monster. The other animals use a root to make monster tracks, then scare him some more, but he catches on when they walk behind a too-sparse hedgerow. He mounts the "head" as a trophy, then shows Hazel how he fought the fearsome beast, but the head comes crashing down and smashes to bits, exposing his ruse.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?215158</url></doc>
