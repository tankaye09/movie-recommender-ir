<plot>A student at National College, Kiran Mathur lives a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay along with her dad, Advocate Hardayal, and mom, Maya. She has a conflict with Professor Prakash Khanna, which does get resolved, but a scandal ensues when a student posts intimate photographs on the college noticeboard, prompting Principal Chandra Shekhar to dismiss Prakash, while Kiran's marriage with Verma's son gets canceled. A visibly upset Hardayal meets with Prakash, and gets him to agree to marry Kiran and thus end the scandal, to which Prakash agrees. The wedding takes place, and shortly thereafter Prakash gets a job as a Manager with a handsome salary. What Hardayal does not know is that due to a disorder of the nervous system Prakash is virtually impotent, and soon their near-idyllic lifestyles will be scandal-ridden again when Prakash will be accused of not only having an affair with his attractive secretary, Asha Chaudhary, but also killing Kiran's fellow collegian, Shakti Singh.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?520966</url></doc>
