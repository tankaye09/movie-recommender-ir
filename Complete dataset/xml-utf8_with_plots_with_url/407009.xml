<plot>Fredric Harwin is a medical illustrator, ocularist, and artist who bridges the distance between art and medicine to make acrylic eyes. He narrates as the camera watches him work, taking us through the 12-step process of making an artificial eye. Fred also shares his goals and values - to help the patient, usually the victim of an accident, feel whole again and feel good about themselves. The editing helps us see as well - sometimes the screen is in a panoramic, sometimes only a small square contains an image.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407009</url></doc>
