<plot>Carlisle [sic] D. Graham jumps into the Lower Rapids opposite the Whirlpool and makes a fine swim to Lewiston, the camera following on a flat car arranged for the purpose. The scene is an interesting and awe inspiring spectacle and shows his coming out of the water and being rubbed down. It also shows him receiving the congratulations of his friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?089423</url></doc>
