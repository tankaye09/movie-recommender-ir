<plot>Ten years ago, Alex Johnson was on top of the world as the most popular member of a famous boy band. These days however, Alex's star doesn't shine so high or so bright and while his career is over, the only thing holding him together is his up and coming marriage to Veronica, a Uruguayan beauty queen. But when Alex and his parents, Al and Barbara, travel to his winter home in beautiful Punta del Este, things fall apart in a very bad way when Al winds up in bed with Veronica. A charming, madcap comedy about cold hearts in the heat of the Uruguayan sun, 14 Days In Paradise is two weeks you'll never forget.</plot><plot>Ten years ago, Alex Johnson was on top of the world as the most popular member of a famous boy band.
