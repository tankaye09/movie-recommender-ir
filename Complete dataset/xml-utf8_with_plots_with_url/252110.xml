<plot>This documentary was filmed in Matenje refugee camp as refugees students were preparing to return to Zimbabwe just after independence. It documents daily life in the camp and interviews with students and teacher tell of the achievements, hardships and dangers of life in exile during the war for independence. The camp was located in Tete province, Mozambique and was home for thousands of kids and their teachers for several years. This film is a record of the sacrifice and idealism of Zimbabwean youth in the struggle that stands in sharp contrast with the situation in present-day Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?252110</url></doc>
