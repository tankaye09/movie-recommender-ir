<plot>Reggie, the impish Marquis of Buckminster, has many friends and is happy with his present bachelor lifestyle. But his grandmother demands that he now get married to one of a few suitable women that she names, and have some children. Two of the women are twin sisters who are friends of his from another aristocratic family, so he visits them, and learns that they already have fiancés but commoners, against their family's wishes. If he can help them to marry the men they want, it will also shorten the list of candidates and maybe help him remain single so Reggie does everything he can to help them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649458</url></doc>
