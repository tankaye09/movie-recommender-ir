<plot>The Mars Society built a prototype of a spacecraft habitat that could land humans on Mars and serve as their base in the exploration of the Martian surface. The purpose of the prototype is to study how astronauts will one day explore and inhabit our neighboring world. This habitat, to which Discovery Channel film crews have exclusive inside access, is the Mars Arctic Research Station (MARS). It was constructed at the Haughton meteorite impact crater on Devon Island in northern Canada, an environment described as a cold polar desert. NASA scientists have been finding an astonishing variety of terrain and natural features there that resemble those reported on the planet Mars. Join the crew of the research station as they conduct experiments, go on away missions and learn how to get along in this harsh environment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523476</url></doc>
