<plot>Alex is an immigration officer whose life is falling apart around him. He is a lonely man given to panic attacks due to a murky incident from his recent past. He has a jerk of a boss (McDowell) and his wife has left him. After a chance encounter with a desperate nursing student(Louise) and a drag queen(Athena), he finds himself playing good Samaritan to his regret. His noble actions however have unintended complications and opportunities. He meets Olivia a woman who is getting over the death of her husband. He also meets Roger a street wise barber whose dimwits belie his gentle nature. This unlikely group of people discover secrets about each other and themselves. In the end will fate and chance bring them together or will it forever rip them apart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340337</url></doc>
