<plot>Bryan Anderson doesn't consider himself to be a very blessed person. In fact, he knows his life kinda sucks. He is an unemployed, down-on-his-luck actor who is always trying to convince his family he can make something of his life. Bryan's best friend and fellow actor, Morris Jeffries, isn't doing any better. When his wife leaves him, Morris is forced to move into Bryan's apartment, as he has nowhere else to go. After the cable is turned off on these two struggling actors, they're left to watch the only channel their TV can pick-up: the Christian Station. That's when Morris sees the light. He convinces Bryan to join him in starting a phony Christian television show called "The Profits Prayer Network." After a slow start, Bryan and Morris pull off the performance of a lifetime on a comical journey that makes them Holy Millionaires. However, just as they reach the height of their popularity, the guys are faced with an ethical decision that jeopardizes the future of the network. Now they need to decide whether to cash in on people's faith or find a faith of their own.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?514791</url></doc>
