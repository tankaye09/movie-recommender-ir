<plot>Bombay-based Professor Amar Verma lives a middle-class lifestyle with his wife, Shobha, and 6 year old son, Kunal. When a gang-war breaks out between Veljibhai and Chhapan Tikle alias Jimmy, a number of innocent bystanders fall victim, one of whom is Kunal. This devastates the Verma family, with Shobha walking out on Amar, who devotes his life to his students. When he finds out one of his students has a stammering problem, he decides to help her, and finds out that she is the only child of gangster Veljibhai. He meets with Veljibhai, discusses the gang-war scenario, then meets with Chhapan Tikle and gets the gangster to agree on a truce so that he can take Pooja and the rest of the students on a field trip to Bangalore. Amar will soon find out that neither Veljibhai nor Chhapan Tikle have any intention of keeping any truce - and he may well have jeopardized his, Pooja's, as well as the lives of his students - as the two gangs set out to kill each other - and anyone else who gets in their way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?498821</url></doc>
