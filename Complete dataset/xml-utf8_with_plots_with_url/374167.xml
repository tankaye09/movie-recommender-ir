<plot>Min-kyung, once a promising young dancer, is now running a small, shabby dance school in town. Her life gets even harder since her entire family is notoriously troublesome. Her father Won-jo is a dotard, her husband Sang-hoon, who aspires to become a film director but can't get himself to finish a screenplay, is jobless, and her son is reckless, calling his dad, ' Uncle '.
