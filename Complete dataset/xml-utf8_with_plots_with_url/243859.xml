<plot>Edgar, finding many jars stored in the cellar, decides it would be a good idea to do some home canning. A painter arrives to paint the kitchen, so Edgar and the family move their operation next door to the kitchen of Mrs. Parker, who isn't home. Edgar manages to smear the walls trying to kill a bee and the pressure cook blows up and splatters the walls. When Mrs.Parker comes home, Edgar allows her to keep the all of the canning to pay for the damage. Then, Florence discovers her ring is missing and they conclude it is in one of the jars. Mrs. Parker charges Edgar for each one he opens and, $740 and 149 jars later, Edgar finds the missing ring.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243859</url></doc>
