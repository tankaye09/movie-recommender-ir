<plot>Alex has a secret talent. He can look at a cloud and make it disappear. When he reveals this to his new girlfriend, Jill, it creates a rift in their budding relationship. If both clouds and the human body are composed of water, Alex surmises, he should be able to control the water in Jill's body to stay with him. In the process of trying to manipulate her molecules, he learns the nature of love, control, and letting go.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?636222</url></doc>
