<plot>A Toronto-based social activist, Priya, meets with out of work Architect, Raj Malhotra, and both end up with a series of hilarious misunderstandings. Priya finds out that Raj is attracted to her, and she also shows an interest in him, though she is seeing Karan Bahl, and all of their friends expect them to get married soon. What Priya does not know is Raj believes that she is lucky for him, and maybe using her to obtain a contract that would involve tearing down a community center and building a shopping mall in it's place.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?293401</url></doc>
