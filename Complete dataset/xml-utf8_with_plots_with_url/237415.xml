<plot>The operations of a herring boat, and of her crew, are typical of the ships and crews that dot the coastal waters of British Columbia. This film goes out to sea to tell the story of the trawler Western Girl, of her skipper and his men, and their race to get their catch before the quota is taken and the fishing area closed. We see the cooperation necessary in an enterprise that has a great element of risk, for though there is big money in herring when the catch is good, competition is keen and the outlay heavy; one man's mistake may mean severe loss.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?237415</url></doc>
