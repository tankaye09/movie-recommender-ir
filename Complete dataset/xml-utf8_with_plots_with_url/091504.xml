<plot>A highly interesting, amusing and instructive scene, showing a number of camel drivers mounted on their beasts engaged in a race, the object being to run their animals over a half mile course, force them to lie down, get up and return to the starting point. A number of tourists are also shown in the same scene, riding for pleasure and receiving instructions from the professional drivers. Some of their antics as they awkwardly mount and dismount the camels are very humorous.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?091504</url></doc>
