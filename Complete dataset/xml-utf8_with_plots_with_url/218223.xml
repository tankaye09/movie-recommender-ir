<plot>In 2008, forty-five of Australia's sexiest Rugby League and Australian Rules footballers were invited to tastefully "bare it all" and model for a 2009 calendar to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer. These Aussie sports stars mustered the courage and accepted the challenge to create some of the hottest and sexiest images ever captured on film. The Gods of Football 2009 Calendar was an international bestseller. Viewers are treated to a backstage pass as the footballers are transformed from professional athletes into international male models, and explore a side of their personalities never before exposed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?218223</url></doc>
