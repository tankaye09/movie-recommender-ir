<plot>Two names Kamal &amp; Pankaj , but the person is one . Kamal use to write his own real life story in the name of Pankaj and people and friends use to appreciate him and his stories but unknown to the fact that it is his own real life story. No one even doubted that Kamal who always smiled was smouldering inside with the lawa of loneliness. Radha who was her dear friend was shocked by one sentence in the novel and she said "Kamal, why are you writing your experiences in the story?" Kamal reported "Because they are mine". Even then Radha didn't realise the significance, and the day she did realise, she got the shock of her life time. For she found that Kamal was in love with Ashok to whom she had married with Kamal's help. For the sake of love for Ashok and Radha, she had sacrificed her love.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?226634</url></doc>
