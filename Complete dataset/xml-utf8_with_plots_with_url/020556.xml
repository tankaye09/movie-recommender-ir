<plot>Ram (Rishi Kapoor) and Rahim (Rakesh Roshan) are childhood, inseparable friends. They complete their schooling, and enroll in an hostel to complete their education. One of their colleagues, Kundan (Ranjeet) frames them for molesting a girl, and has both rusticated. Without any means to survive, both masquerade as a male and a female, and get employed as tutors to a wealthy young lady, Sameera (Tina Munim). Both fall in love with Sameera, and both think that she loves him and him only. Sameera must now decide who to chose.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020556</url></doc>
