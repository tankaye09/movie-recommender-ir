<plot>Judith Map is a recently divorced woman who works in a call center where she is surrounded primarily by empty cubicles. The world outside is a dystopian vision. Although it looks eerily normal and similar to our own. It's also populated by listless gangs of kids called Dinosaurs that half-heartedly vandalize neighborhoods; an older generation that gathers in bars to form militias; and people who mysteriously just sleep. Judith comes home one day to find one of the sleepy people on her porch. She takes him inside. She likes him. What follows is Judith simultaneously falling into a dream, and experiencing an awakening. Judith Map finds herself trying to love, and live with, a man who's seemingly caught up in a remote world of strife - A psychic/emotional/symbolic terrain that takes him out of the real world and threatens his potential relationship with her. Her experience awakens a whole new world both outside and within.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?501432</url></doc>
