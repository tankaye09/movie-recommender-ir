<plot>After the death of her businessman husband, Mrs. Sinha lives a wealthy lifestyle in Delhi, with her son, Vinod, who has taken over the business; and her daughter, Kajal, while she herself indulges herself with some friends to play cards - quite obsessively. Vinod would like Kajal to get married to his friend, Shyam, but Kajal does not like him. One day she informs Vinod that she is in love with Anand, who works with the local florist. Vinod and his mom disapprove of him, but Kajal is adamant. Vinod meets with Anand and asks him to test whether his love for Kajal is true and long-lasting, and asks him to stay from her for several months, to which he agrees and also promises to talk to Kajal about this. Before that could happen, Kajal and her mom are shocked to read in the newspapers that Anand has been fired from his job, is unemployed now; he has also been evicted from the neighborhood and has left for another unknown place, and the reason behind is that Anand has been accused of raping a young woman named Roopa during Holi. Then a few months later, just as suddenly as he had disappeared, Anand re-appears again in Kajal's life - as a wealthy man who calls himself Ashok Narayan. The question remains where is Anand and who exactly is this look-alike?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?020569</url></doc>
