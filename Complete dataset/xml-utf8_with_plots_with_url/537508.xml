<plot>Using her family's position and her fianc√©'s connections, in 1938 Leona Brittling lands her first journalistic assignment in Hong Kong. Naive, untested and thoroughly stubborn, Leona travels to the ancient capital of Hankow to report from the front, where she becomes caught up in the chaos and gross injustices of the Japanese invasion. Her entanglement with a maverick French reporter, Andre Valois, and deep friendship with Chen Tien-Chun, a dedicated but disillusioned doctor, brings Leona to an understanding of where her destiny - and her heart - lies . Trapped behind enemy lines, the events she chronicles will change her life forever. That Year in China is based on the diaries of journalist Doris Reubens Macauley.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?537508</url></doc>
