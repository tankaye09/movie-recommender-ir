<plot>For a fee of Rs.200/- Ankush Ramdev provides four witnesses to couples who come to register their marriages at the Registrar of Marriages in Dariyaganj, Delhi. One day he comes across a single woman from Nainital and offers his services, but the girl tells him that she is waiting for her to-be groom, Dheeraj Ansaria. At the end of the day, when he does not show up, Ankush feels sorry for her, Megha Joshi, and offers to assist her until he gets back. They spend the night at a Dargah, and then go to wait for Dheeraj, who does not show. A penniless and tearful Megha now asks Ankush to help, he helps her again, and falls in love with her, so much so that he considers learning English and re-locating to Bombay. Then he comes across a young man, who later identifies himself as Dheeraj, who is desperately looking for his bride-to-be. Watch what Ankush does or does not do to assist Dheeraj.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026465</url></doc>
