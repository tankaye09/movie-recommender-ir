<plot>During World War II, the Axis Powers had devised elaborate plans to terrorize the American homeland. The Germans landed enemy agents on our eastern shores armed with explosives. Their mission was to disrupt military related manufacturing and create widespread terror by placing explosives in department store and train station heating systems. Their plans were quickly halted when one of the enemy agents turned himself in to the FBI and the rest were soon captured before any destruction was carried out. The Japanese launched more than a thousand 30 foot diameter hydrogen filled balloons across the Pacific Ocean carrying bombs designed to start massive forest fires. Due to weather conditions, none of the balloon bombs started forest fires. However, one balloon did land in Bly, Oregon killing a minister, his wife and several children who were on a picnic.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?531519</url></doc>
