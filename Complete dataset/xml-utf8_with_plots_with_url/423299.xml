<plot>This "Pacemaker" (production number K7-1)proports to tell the story of how dancer Dorothy Babb got her big break into films by making an appearance on the "Authur Godfrey Talent Scouts" radio program. Yes, the "Arthur Godfrey Talent Scouts" program was on radio long before it was on television and, yes, radio was not just confined to audible acts and we offer Edgar Bergen &amp; Charlie McCarthy, and Eleanor Powell tap-dancing up a storm as examples. The non-story here is that Dorothy Babb, as a child and teen-ager, had been in films for nearly ten years before the Arthur Godfrey Talent Scouts program made its radio debut, but Godfrey was never one to let the facts stand in the way of a good story. Godfrey,the Old Redhead, serves as the narrator and radio show host, and Dorothy wins and gets to dance with Johnny Coy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?423299</url></doc>
