<plot>A crisp summer's day in London. Commuters pile onto the Golden Jubilee Footbridges which surround the old core of Hungerford Bridge. The day progresses as people bask in the splendour of the bridge. But suddenly there are people everywhere - rush hour! People, people, people. Everyone, it seems, is quickly clamouring to leave the bridge... A modern-day city-symphony, the film presents an abstract journey over Hungerford Bridge and the footbridges alongside it. Taking inspiration from the Soviet Montage Theorists, the film also examines the clash between the modern and old, in content (bridge/footbridges) and in form (style/technology).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250295</url></doc>
