<plot>The traditional Azerbaijani wedding wish serves as the title to this film and appears to be just a flowery ritual formula. Yet the colorful ethnographic scenes reveal a tragedy that has lasted for ages. In this patriarchal society, girls are unwanted and "useless." In the past, new-born girls were often simply killed; yet, since the development of ultrasound, women have been compelled to seek abortions. Such an attitude towards women occasionally results in terrible family tragedies, one of which shook Azerbaijan a few years ago.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658803</url></doc>
