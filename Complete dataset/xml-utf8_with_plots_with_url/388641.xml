<plot>Johnny is an expert at judo, water skiing, golf, tennis, scuba diving, and racing cars, but is a helpless flop around women. One night, in an effort to cure him, his doctor takes him to a nightclub to get him used to being around attractive women. Johnny faints and is humiliated by the newspapers revealing his "malady" and runs away, flying his plane to a remote part of the ocean where he crashes on a island of nude women. At first, Johnny is afraid to look at the naked women...but soon they have him considering the lure of nudity as well.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?388641</url></doc>
