<plot>This is the most expensively constructed railway of its length in the world. It is 114 miles in length, and contains more cuts and fills, trestles and bridges, tunnels and snowsheds, than any 114 miles of continuous track in existence. The two miles shown in this subject give one an excellent idea of some of the difficulties of construction encountered.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?622670</url></doc>
