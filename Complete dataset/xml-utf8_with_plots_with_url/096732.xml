<plot>Shows a suburbanite asleep in bed. He discovers he has overslept himself, and jumps out of bed. His shirt, trousers, shoes, collar, tie, coat, vest, hat, cane, cigar and satchel rise from the floor and adjust themselves up to him and he makes a hasty exit. The scene dissolves to a railroad station, showing the suburbanite running to catch the rear platform of a moving train.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?096732</url></doc>
