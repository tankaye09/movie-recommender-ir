<plot>In this animated cooking show. A chicken named Youngy Henman and his friends Terry Bull and Mack Swine wake up to find they are the last three animals on the farm who haven't been eaten by Farmer Mullet. They hatch a plan to turn the barn into a restaurant before he wakes up and make him vegetarian chili for lunch to save themselves from the stew pot. All the while they are being spied on by Farmer Mullet's loyal dog Elvis the Hound Dog.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?115035</url></doc>
