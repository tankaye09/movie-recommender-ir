<plot>WHEN THE WORLD RUNS FAST asks the question: What is success? About When the World Runs Fast: Must it mean fame and fortune? Does it always lead to selling one's soul? You've heard the stories of rock bands making it big while giving up family and friends along the way; is that the only path to the top? Or can successful musicians be happy in a small pond, as a creative, viable force in their community, with time left for life's simple pleasures? This is the story of musicians, Honor Among Thieves, who have created their own definition of success.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653633</url></doc>
