<plot>Yo Amrani is a young Persian-American boy with a dream, to own a pair of AIRs, the coolest, most expensive sneakers around. Convinced that this is the only way he can win the heart of Carrie Ann the cutest girl in school, Yo becomes distraught by his father's refusal to buy him the coveted shoes. When a golden, but less than noble, opportunity finally presents itself, Yo is faced with the kind of moral dilemma that ~II help to define the man he is to become. With the help his father's tough love and his mother's quiet wisdom, Yo ultimately finds the courage to make a tough choice and stay true to himself.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026964</url></doc>
