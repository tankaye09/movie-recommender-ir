<plot>A shy young girl who can't swim is bored by the normal happenings at the public pool that her mother and brother enjoy. Then a pair of unlikely patrons show up, an attractive young Asian woman wearing designer swimsuit and accessories, and her manservant with an umbrella and a case full of elegant bar items. The woman lounges, staying out of the water and sun, while her servant fixes her a drink and stands attentively in the sun in his black suit. The girl becomes fascinated with the pair, especially the servant, maybe to the point of obsession. When the woman falls asleep, the girl and the servant exchange long stares. Will they make a connection of some kind?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?521192</url></doc>
