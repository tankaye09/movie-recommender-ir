<plot>From the vantage of a helicopter, Olivo Barbieri directs his camera first on isolated land, where a solitary four-wheel-drive vehicle tears around, and then on to Las Vegas. Casinos dominate the skyline and Barbieri's frame. There are day and night shots, including the spectacular nighttime water show outside Caesar's. The soundtrack alternates between the sound of the helicopter and the sounds of casinos, particularly chattering voices as at a cocktail party and the calliope jingling of slot machines. The opening desert shot gives a sense of the isolation of the city, which is underscored by a skyline of tall buildings with little to connect them.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?499285</url></doc>
