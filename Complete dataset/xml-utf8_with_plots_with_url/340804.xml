<plot>"Loneliness in a Goldfish Bowl" is a warm-hearted drama about a lonely, middle-aged man, James, who finds his way into society through the ordinary lives of the family next door. When the family first moves in, James begins to follow their lives simply by listening to the sounds of their everyday activities. James interactions with the neighbors gradually increase, by first imitating their actions, and then slowly participating in their lives...to the point where the family realizies his involvement.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?340804</url></doc>
