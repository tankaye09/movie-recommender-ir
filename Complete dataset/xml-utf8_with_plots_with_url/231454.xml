<plot>In a dump he walks through on his way to school, an Arab lad in Jerusalem finds a small, red electronic game. He picks it up and plays with it as he walks. Security cameras follow him. Near the school entrance, one of his teachers confiscates it, and the teacher, in turn, has it taken from him by two Israeli soldiers. We follow the toy, as do the omnipresent security cameras, into the hands of a caf√© owner, and then to a Japanese tourist, a nun, an Orthodox boy, and more. Its very presence, with its lights and beeps, causes suspicion and sometimes alarm. Is this a world in which it's unsafe to carry a toy?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231454</url></doc>
