<plot>Amar Saxena is a businessman, and the Managing Director of prestigious Khaitan Fans Ltd., India. One day while leaving from a board meeting, he meets a beggar named Jagmohan, who calls him Rohit, and asks him to return home to his ailing wife, Seema. Amar denies being Rohit, but feels sorry for him and gives him some money, which Jagmohan declines to accept. Curious at his refusal, Amar offers to help. He visits the hospital and gets to meet Seema, and ends up falling in love with her. What he does not know that Jagmohan and Seema are plainclothes police officers, who have been assigned to arrest him for the murder of Ram Kumar Saxena, Amar's uncle. Using his wits, Amar manages to convince the Court that he is of unsound mind, and thus escapes being imprisoned, and ends up in an asylum. From here Amar must stock of his life, and figure out who has framed him for a murder he did not commit, and why Seema and Jagmohan were so intent to incriminate him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?102239</url></doc>
