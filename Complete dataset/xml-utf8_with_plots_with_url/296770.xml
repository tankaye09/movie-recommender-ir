<plot>Based on the book "We Called it War" by Denzil Batson, this feature documentary tells the heroing experiences of the front line infantry man in the Korean War, long known as the "Forgotten War." As a young man from southwest Missouri, Denzil Batson was sent with thousands of American soldiers to defend freedom and democracy in the hills and rice paddies of Korea during the Korean War between 1950 and 1953. The story revolves around Denzil's 2nd Platoon of 'F' Company of the 3rd Division. Known as "dog face" soldiers, Denzil's platoon buddies get together and tell their stories from 50 years ago with vivid reality. From the Pusan Perimeter to the Frozen Chosin reservoir to the Yalu river, these aging American heroes fought the Chinese and North Koreans in trenches with hand grenades and bayonets and died for America's freedom. "Korea: We Called it War" is a vivid account of events told by some of the men who lived it, fought it and are still trying to cope with it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?296770</url></doc>
