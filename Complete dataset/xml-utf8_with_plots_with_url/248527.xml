<plot>Danny and Jack are stuck with a dead body: their former best friend. Disposing of him seemed simple enough...until the cops showed up. Armed with a shovel and no clue, these two idiots make a series of hilarious mistakes as they evade the suspicious attempts of nosy Officer Wallace. Sure to entertain...even the dead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?248527</url></doc>
