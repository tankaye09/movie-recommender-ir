<plot>Over one hundred kids come to campus of young actors with hopes to find the open door or to learn how to breakthrough in the Hollywood film industry. Most of them, with all their innocence, have faith in their talent and believe in destiny to become a "star child". Therefore, they want to prove with evident willingness, with compelling ardor in front of the others children, teachers, parents, and agents that they are talented, that they have something more than others and thereby deserve to be "chosen". The film shows the journey of three children toward their dream: becoming a professional actor in the Hollywood film industry. The film shows them driven by their inner passion observing their efforts but also exploring some exteriors pressures on them from society.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?075940</url></doc>
