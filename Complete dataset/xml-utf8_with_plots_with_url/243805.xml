<plot>Stuck meandering through the odyssey of his mid-twenties, Craig finds himself at a crossroads on how to proceed with his life. Finishing college has opened few to little doors, while his home life is awkwardly spent having quiet meals with his parents and high school-aged cousin, Alice. In fact, Craig's beginning to have sexual fantasies about his cousin. Though it's odd (and extremely wrong), his feelings may be inherent of his uneasiness to leave familiarity and his home behind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?243805</url></doc>
