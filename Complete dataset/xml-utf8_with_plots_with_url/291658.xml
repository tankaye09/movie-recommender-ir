A prominant woman has accumulated a massive amount of bad debt from shady characters and threatened them with police exposure, yet seems resigned to her fate when informed of a contract on her life. In fact, she even seems to look forward to her own demise. Why?

Finally, an impasse is reached with dire consequences for all....</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?291658</url></doc>
