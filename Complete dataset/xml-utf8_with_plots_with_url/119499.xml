<plot>On April 15, 1947 Jackie Robinson crossed the white lines of Ebbets field for the Brooklyn Dodgers and became the first African American baseball player in the history of the Major Leagues. Before Robinson's historic career in the Major Leagues African American baseball players played in what was known as the "Negro National Leagues." This stirring first hand account told by former Negro League and Major League baseball players is a haunting portrait of segregation in America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?119499</url></doc>
