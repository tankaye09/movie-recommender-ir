<plot>Three contestants compete in a game of musical knowledge. In round one, six faces or famous places were shown to the contestants. The Tommy Oliver Orchestra, the show's featured orchestra, played a tune relating in some way to one of the six faces. The first contestant to identify the tune could try to match the tune with the subject for points. In round two, up to four songs were played, all of them relating to a famous person, place, thing, etc.; the first contestant to guess a song title and its subject won points. The two highest scoring contestants moved on to round three, with identical rules to round two. The highest-scoring contestant at the end of the third round played the previous day's champion in the endgame, where the two contestants guessed a series of related song titles and tried to identify a celebrity through a series of up to six photographs "ranging from childhood to maturity." The contestant who identified the celebrity using just one photograph won him/her $10,000; otherwise, prize packages from $1,000 to $5,000 went to the day's champion. Five-time champions won a car, while a 10-day winner retired with an around-the-world vacation.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187283</url></doc>
