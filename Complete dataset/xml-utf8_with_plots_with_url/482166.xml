<plot>Screen Snapshots visits some Hollywood stars at home with their spouses and children, including Eddie Cantor and his five daughters, some vintage (old-for-1949) footage with Bing Crosby and Dixie Lee when the headcount for their home was only one boy (they had four by 1949, all born in the 30's), and other families around town.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?482166</url></doc>
