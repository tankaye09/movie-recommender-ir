<plot>On the banks of the holy River Ganga, Gopi, a ferryman conducts an unconsummated romance with Radha, a girl from the upper classes. At the same time, he rejects the advances of Gauri, a girl from his own village, who is attracting the unwanted attention of Radha's lecherous uncle. Fate is not kind to them. Radha is married off to a man she doesn't care for and Gopi is severely beaten by thugs sent by Radha's uncle after he prevents him from molesting Gauri. Radha's husband dies suddenly and she returns home in disgrace to find her father is dangerously ill. However, the attraction between Radha and Gopi remains as strong as ever and ugly rumours start to circulate about the nature of their relationship - for which Gopi blames the jealous Gauri. Emotions come to the boil and tragedy results. Fortunately, for all concerned, another birth awaits them......</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?369773</url></doc>
