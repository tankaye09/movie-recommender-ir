<plot>A general-knowledge quiz show, in which contestants competed to complete question contracts in order to win cash prizes. The contestant would chose from a selection of categories and try to answer a randomly chosen number of questions from that category. With each correct answer, the prize money in the pot would grow larger, until he had completed the contract and could put the money into his bank. If he missed a question, however, his opponent was given the chance to complete the contract and claim the prize money for himself. The first contestant to put $2000 dollars in their bank won the game.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?086442</url></doc>
