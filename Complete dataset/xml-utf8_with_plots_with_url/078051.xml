<plot>Tetsuro Koyanagi (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of J-pop group SMAP), a workaholic, is caught off-guard one day by his wife's sudden request for a divorce. He fails to take her seriously, and she leaves him, running off to Paris. However, she also leaves behind their young daughter, Rin (adorably portrayed by Karen Miyama). Tetsuro has not played much of a part in raising Rin, but he learns what being a father means to him, as well as what he really wants in life, with emotional support from Rin's English teacher Yura Kitajima (Koyuki).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?078051</url></doc>
