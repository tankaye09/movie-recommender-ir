<plot>Maybe, George Wilkinson thought an act of contrition would let him escape his past. That was his first mistake. A loving family, but disillusioned, and middle-aged, he shields himself in a benevolent Christian organization. Most graying guys find solace in fast cars, and fast women, while battling fast denial, but George's faith has cemented his marriage and his secret life, has cemented his fate. Is this really an affair of denial, or is it an act of contradiction? While walking the line, in both states of mind, things go horribly wrong.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?264109</url></doc>
