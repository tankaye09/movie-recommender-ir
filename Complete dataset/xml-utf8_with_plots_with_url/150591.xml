<plot>"Johnny Jones and his sister Sue are playing at the well. Johnny falls in. Sue runs to the house and calls her mother, who rushes out. She angles for Johnny with the rope and hook, and finally catches him by the seat of his trousers. In this way he is hauled up dripping wet, only to receive a sound spanking for getting into mischief."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150591</url></doc>
