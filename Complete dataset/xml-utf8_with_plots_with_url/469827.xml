<plot>Bixby is a horrid employer who fires Gail because she refuses to give in to his sexual advances. Her two co-workers, Patty and Suzy, quit in protest and the three decide to become full-time self-employed entrepreneurs in the "World's Oldest Profession." "If you've got to let somebody squeeze the goods," says Gail, "you might as well get paid for it!" The enterprise is an outstanding success and their 9 to 5 world is crowded with lust-filled men and couples looking to add spice to their lives. One day old Bixby catches their ad in the paper and phones for an appointment. Recognizing his voice, the girls plan a just revenge!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?469827</url></doc>
