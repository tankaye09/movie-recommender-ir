<plot>Old gentleman stretches himself on the long seat of a French railway car, after placing numerous bundles in the rack above him, and also in the rack over the seat in the opposite side of the compartment. Train stops at next station and lady enters with her pet dog. Having bundles of her own which she wishes to place in the rack over her seat, she takes down the old man's bundles and places them on him and his seat. She then begins to fondle the dog. Old man gets angry, takes his large pipe and begins to smoke. Lady objects and after an argument snatches the pipe from the man and throws it out the window. The man reciprocates by throwing the dog out. Lady enraged, tugs vigorously at the bell rope. Train stops and scene changes to outside. Behold the dog sitting on his haunches with the pipe in his mouth, much to the surprise of the old gentleman and lady, and also the audience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?322891</url></doc>
