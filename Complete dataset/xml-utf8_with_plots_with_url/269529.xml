<plot>Can you grasp Israel by its rock and pop bands? Can you see through them the complexities, the tribulation and the dreams of this young country? Can you sense through song and music the divisions among its people, their craving for peace, their pain and their disillusionment at war? That's exactly what Israel Rocks! is about. Hearing the band of the rocker Rabbi Tuvia Bolton who sings of the Messiah who'll come and fix everything while Shalom Hanoch sings that the Messiah won't come and he won't even phone, one can perceive the clash between the religious and the non-religious Jews that came to a head with the killing of prime minister Rabin by a religious Jew. Also directed by Abrahami and Netz: Simply Human.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?269529</url></doc>
