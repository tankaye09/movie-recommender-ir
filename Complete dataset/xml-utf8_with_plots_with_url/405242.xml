<plot>The marriage of Anna and Christos deteriorates over time, going from bad to worse. The couple's crisis is obvious, and Christos tries to obtain sole custody of their children. Their older daughter, Sapfo, already has a boyfriend, while young Alexis is taken by his father to his mistress, Sonia, for his erotic initiation. His father is unaware, however, that Sonia is also the lover of certain other men, such as Agis and Takis, namely the father and brother of his wife. The entire, complex secret comes to light when Anna discovers her husband's infidelity from a mutual friend, Vasilis, who has been in love with her for a long time and discretely keeps her company. Anna assigns the "Sonia case" to a private investigator, while in the meantime she has started working and supporting herself, having decided to separate from her husband. Upon leaving, she takes along the children, who have already experienced the unpleasant consequences of domestic disharmony - with unexpected results: Sapfo gets pregnant; her boyfriend dies in a car accident, and Alexis fails his school exams.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?405242</url></doc>
