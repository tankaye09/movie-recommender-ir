<plot>Bizce Boyle TV, is a groundbreaking television program produced by the Turkish youth of Melbourne shown fortnightly on Channel 31. In a short period of time, the program has become an integral part of the Turkish community, as it is our only free-to-air television based source of communication in Australia. The program is produced on a non-profit basis, therefore any financial assistance gained is reimbursed back into the production level of the program. We have so far gathered a team of enthusiastic members, who are working tirelessly to make this program a success. The team consists of mainly University students who are striving to gain the necessary experience to further their future ambitions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?072388</url></doc>
