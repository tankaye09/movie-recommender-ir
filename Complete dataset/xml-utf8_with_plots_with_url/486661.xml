<plot>Serengeti Symphony is all about how classical music and astounding imagery intertwine, delivering to the viewer the day-to-day life of animals and people of the Serengeti National Reserve in Tanzania. Colorful images, high-speed chases by cheetahs, all animals that live in harmony together in the Reserve, they make watching and listening to the Serengeti Symphony something that everyone should do at least once. It truly delivers us the beauty of Africa. This movie is shown as a musical documentary with hardly any voice-over and does not, like Hugo van Lawick's previous movie "The Leopard Son", try to tell us a romanticized story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?486661</url></doc>
