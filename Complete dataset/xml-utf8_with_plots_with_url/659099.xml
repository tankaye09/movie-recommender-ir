<plot>With a strange twist of fate, these four beautiful women find themselves snowed into a cabin together; and due to terrible road conditions, all they have to compensate for the absence of their men is an overflowing amount of champagne. After a few too many drinks, their friendship is put through its most difficult challenge, as the women begin to lash out at each other. The supply of champagne may be low, but emotions are running high, as shocking secrets crawl out of the wood work and cold truths are laid on the table. Throughout the fault-finding and finger pointing, these women compel each other to identify and face aspects of their lives that they've been struggling to hide from. Ultimately, inspiring each other to overcome necessary obstacles and find fulfillment where there once was emptiness.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?659099</url></doc>
