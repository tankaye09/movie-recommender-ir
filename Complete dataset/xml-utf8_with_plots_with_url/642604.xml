<plot>The mailmen, Sime, is one of the favorite people of a small town, on an island in the middle of the sea. Sime is very intelligent and the locals have high regards for him because he is unusually well versed in all the events and destinies in the small town. He knows the weather forecast, what winds will blow, what the sermon on the Sunday mass will be. For all the locals Sime is an untouchable genius. However, unlike the locals, the viewers soon find out that the Sime's ingenuity is based on his reading of the mail. Fascinated by other people's destinies, Sime has perfected a way for opening letters and keeping complete records on the people living on the island. He keeps a precise track of who gets what kinds of letters, and that gives him insight into discrete and private affairs of people. One day a beautiful woman named Dea moves into town, and all the men try and court her. However, Dea is keeping some kind of a secret and she completely ignores all their attempts, also charming attempts by the mailman Sime. Suddenly, by chain of events, she completely by accident finds out about the mailman's "hobby" i.e. that he reads other people's mails. At that time she herself starts receiving letters from a mysterious Klara who she starts an intensive correspondence with. The mailman, naturally, reads Dea's mails and he's putting the "puzzle" of her life together. He plans a courtship based on the things he finds out about her. He likes Dea very much so he gives his best to win her over (naturally, he does it by using privileged information he acquires by reading her letters). After a short time Dea "falls" for his charms and everything seems idyllic. However with time, town's people turn against Sime claiming that Dea "stole him away". Sime is not concerned about it because the more time he spends with Dea the more he likes her. However what is Dea really like?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?642604</url></doc>
