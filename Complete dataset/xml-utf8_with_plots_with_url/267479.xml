<plot>INTO UNDIES is a brand new fashion makeover show where the makeover is all about what's under... Each week, we'll take a different woman on a unique lingerie buying experience. We start by determining what the woman of the week currently has in her wardrobe and why she needs a change. We then go to a lingerie store, first to get properly sized, then to pick out underwear that the woman will feel comfortable in. We will deal with three distinct styles of underwear each week. First, we'll handle the everyday stuff -- bras and panties for work and play. Then we'll go for something sexier -- something to wear on a night with that special someone. Finally, we'll focus on a different specialty concern each week -- from sports bras to bridal lingerie to maternity wear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?267479</url></doc>
