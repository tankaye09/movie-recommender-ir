<plot>"The thoroughly drilled cavalry man only attains perfection by the severest schooling and constant practice. A very interesting sight to be seen in any fort is the daily drill of the young recruits in horsemanship. This film shows the seargent king of rough riders drilling the square of recruits who will some day be turned out as finished cavalry men. The actions of the horses, the occasional blunders of the men and the constant life and motion render this a highly interesting film while the comic element adds to its acceptability."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?532825</url></doc>
