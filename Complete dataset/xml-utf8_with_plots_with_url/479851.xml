<plot>SCARLET WATERS, a compilation of four horror shorts; including SCORNED. SCORNED shows the downfall of a family through lies, deceit, and infidelity as Sara watches her family torn apart by David's cheating. In attempt to save her family, she makes a deal with an old friend that threatens her very life. WRITER'S BLOCK is the story of Melissa who is struggling with her screenplay. Facing a deadline, she can't seem to focus her plot, premise, or characters. But, as her script starts to take shape, so too does the crime in her story - all too close to home. DETOUR, chronicles a creature who stalks a small town, feeding off lawbreakers. After killing all the murderers, drug dealers, and rapists, the creature turns to violators of the smallest, most innocuous laws. Now Joanne, stranded alone, must negotiate her way to safety. VAMPRESS tells of a young woman bitten, haunted, and pursued by a night stalker. In a film described as "hauntingly erotic," Victoria lay helpless as her boyfriend and doctor battle a vampire for her life and her soul.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?479851</url></doc>
