<plot>Widowed Kamla Srivastav lives in a Bungalow named "Kamla Nivas", named after her by her late husband, Shrikant, where she now lives with her grown son, Virendra, his wife, Rekha, and their daughter, Sunita. Kamla's chores include all household work, including cleaning, cooking, washing clothes as well as running errands outdoors. She is shunned, belittled, and berated by Rekha and generally ignored by Virendra, with the only bright spot in her life being Sunita. Then there is widowed Amrit Lal Sharma, who lives in the same neighborhood, also in a Bungalow where he used to live with his late wife, Savitri, who died after being run over by a truck. The Sharma family now consists of Amrit's son, Madan, his wife, Poonam, and their son, Rahul. Amrit is yelled at, belittled, humiliated and treated like a servant by Poonam, while Madan merely remains a spectator, and the only bright spot in Amrit's life is h Rahul. Watch what happens when Amrit and Kamla meet each other in the park and find out how they are being abused by their respective children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?036301</url></doc>
