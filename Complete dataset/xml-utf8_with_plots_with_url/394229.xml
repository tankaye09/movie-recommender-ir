<plot>A budding love affair as experienced by the new pairs of shoes each of the couple has just bought. He notices her at the shoe store and chats her up as they sit side by side trying on new pairs. She rebuffs him at first, finally, as they finish their purchases, agreeing to have dinner with him. Meanwhile, the two pairs of shoes start to talk, sharing stories they've heard of how mean owners can be. The shoes decide to take matters into their own hands, giving their owners' feet a pinch. At the nightclub, while the couple gets to know each other (and remove their shoes for relief), the shoes continue their new friendship. Maybe each has found a soul mate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?394229</url></doc>
