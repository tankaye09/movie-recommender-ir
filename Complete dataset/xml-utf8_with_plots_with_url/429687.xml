<plot>Scientist Willard Freeman tests out his virtual reality simulation by downloading his mind into the character of a fictional detective searching for a serial killer. But soon the scientist finds himself trapped within a surreal nightmare when an invading computer virus locks his mind into the program. As his subconscious memories affect the pattern of events in the simulation, his detective alter ego must solve this existential mystery before the killer finds him, and destroys his conscious mind.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?429687</url></doc>
