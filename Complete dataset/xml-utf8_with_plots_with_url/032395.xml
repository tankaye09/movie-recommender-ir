<plot>A maid is setting the dining table. She leaves and a messenger brings a suit in, puts it over the back of a chair and leaves. A tramp enters and starts to put food from the table into a pack, but he sees the suit and decides to wear it. He steps behind a screen, removes his tattered garments and drapes them over the screen. The maid returns and removes both the new suit and the tramp's clothing, and the screen. The tramp is seen wearing a barrel as the police escort him from the room.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?032395</url></doc>
