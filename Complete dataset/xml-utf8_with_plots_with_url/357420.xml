<plot>As World War Two progressed the United States became more and more in need of fresh recruits and the decision was made to start training black soldiers. But they weren't treated equally. Three war veterans tell about their experiences with racism during war times. Pilot Roger Terry dared to enter the officer's office which was illegally made forbidden territory for blacks and paid for it. Routh is a survivor of the explosion incident at Port Chicago, California in which hundreds of blacks were killed. Vernon Baker is a true war hero, but never got a proper reward until 1997.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?357420</url></doc>
