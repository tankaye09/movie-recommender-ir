<plot>'Made in Coney Island' is filled with images from the summer of 2007. A time when Astroland had recently been purchased by Thor Equities with plans to demolish the famed amusement park at the end of the 2007 for re-development. Many were sure the last days of Coney Island had sadly arrived. Being such a special place, I was driven to capture as many images from that summer as possible as a record of that time and so all future generations would know the spirit of America's playground.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?350920</url></doc>
