<plot>One Friday afternoon, young Davy Allen discovers that a dog, Buck, is badly wounded around the neck because of the collar he is forced to wear by his owner, Mr. Thornycroft. When Buck comes through the yard's fence, Davy removes the collar. Even though Davy tells the dog to stay in his owner's yard, the dog follows him home. Along the way, he greets Squire Kirby, the circuit magistrate, who is driving his buggy to town. When Davy gets home, he tells his mother he doesn't know whose dog it is, and she allows him to keep it. Monday morning Mr. Thornycroft comes to the Allen house and accuses Davy of stealing his dog. Davy refuses to give up Buck and even threatens Thornycroft with a rock. Later that day the sheriff advises Davy and his mother that Thornycroft has sworn out a warrant, and they are to appear before the magistrate the next day. After hearing the evidence, Squire Kirby returns Buck to Mr. Thornycroft. He also tells Thornycroft that in addition to being the circuit magistrate, he is the local president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He states that in that capacity he will swear out a warrant against Thornycroft for animal cruelty, and at the trial will fine him $500 and sentence him to a year in jail, or both. Either that, or the owner can relinquish all rights to the dog immediately and turn it over to the court.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007833</url></doc>
