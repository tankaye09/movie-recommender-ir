<plot>In a charming dining room a very attractive young lady is seen seated at the table, evidently waiting for the caller who is to share a quiet little dinner for two. A moment later a dude of the regular chappy type enters and seats himself at the table. As soon as the meal commences the inevitable wicked small boy sneaks in unobserved, and producing a piece of rope ties one end securely to the dude's coat tails and fastens the other to the table-cloth. He then crawls under the table and in great glee awaits the result of his operations. At this moment an unexpected interruption occurs. The door is flung rudely open and papa enters the peaceful scene, at sight of whom the dude rises from the table and makes a dash for the door. Unfortunately for him his coat-tails are securely tied to the table cloth, and as he makes his exit he drags off the crockery and table-cloth and overturns the table with a tremendous crash, being forcibly assisted out of the door by the irate parent's shoe-toe, who then rushes back into the room and administers a sound spanking to Maude's naughty little brother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?361452</url></doc>
