<plot>Goran is 30, living in a small Bosnian town. Unlike his friends, whose lives have been seriously altered by war (his best friend Miro lost both his arms in the war), Goran got away from it almost untouched. He lives off his parents' inheritance and spends his days boozing with his buddies. One day, all his friends get killed in a drunken altercation. This throws him completely off his routine, and he decides to sell all his belongings and start doing something memorable. He ends up going from town to town, spending one day in each of them, and handing away completely free drinks, for as long as the money he got after selling all his belongings lasts. In the first town he visits with his travelling bar, he decides that he himself won't drink a drop of alcohol on the entire journey. He is initially stymied by the huge distrust of people upon seeing the sign "All for Free". The distrust almost always results in initial hostility, but after the people see he has no dishonest intentions, Goran is free to go to the next town. As Bosnia is a relatively small country, the word spreads fast, and Goran encounters less and less distrust as he goes on, and people start taking to him. After a few weeks on the road, in one of the towns he meets a girl and almost immediately falls in love. This leads him to break his own word, and he starts drinking. Trying to become as intimate as he can be with the girl, he breaks his other rule too, and stays a second day in the town. The owner of the sole local bar doesn't like that, and he has Goran beaten and banished. Goran has to break his journey for a few days and book himself into a motel, until his wounds heal. He drinks the whole time, and after he gets a bit better, he takes the last of his money and goes off to the final town on his journey...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?524197</url></doc>
