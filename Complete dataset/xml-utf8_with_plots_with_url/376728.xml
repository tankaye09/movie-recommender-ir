<plot>Moonshine, rot-gut, white lightning. It's the rebel liquor that sparked a deadly war between bootleggers and the law, launched NASCAR as a nationwide sensation, and still pours freely in unexpected places. Who's making moonshine and what crafty tricks keep them one step ahead of the law? Is moonshine safe to drink? Or are there unexpected dangers lurking in every jar? We'll travel the Appalachian backwoods and discover real stills in action. We'll meet Junior Johnson, the legendary NASCAR driver, who got his start as a moonshine hauler. And we'll hit the Indy Racing League track to see who's putting MOONSHINE in their tanks.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?376728</url></doc>
