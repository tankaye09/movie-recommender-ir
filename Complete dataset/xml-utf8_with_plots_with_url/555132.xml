<plot>An old, grumpy-looking individual is seated behind a table, on which a black bottle and a tumbler is placed. From the expression on his face one would think he was suffering from a bad case of indigestion and he frowns on everything in sight. Suddenly he picks up the bottle, and, reading the words "Elixir of Life" on the label, he determines to sample it, thinking it may do him good. He uncorks it, and, pouring a thick, black liquid into the tumbler from the bottle, proceeds to drain the glass, but with no apparent relish. He perseveres, however, and finally empties the bottle, when, lo, he is changed into a young and healthy man, and by his action one can readily understand that he recommends the Elixir to all who would be young and healthy.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?555132</url></doc>
