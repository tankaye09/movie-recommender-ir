<plot>What happens to places when we left them? 'The journey' is about the stories that are bound to us in eternity. Childhood memories. Places, colors and sounds - things we attempt to revive. Is this possible? Can these gaps of the past be refilled with life? A young man has began the journey to search for those lost memories. He hopes to find his identity at the places where everything began, but his encounters are not what he had expected.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?567629</url></doc>
