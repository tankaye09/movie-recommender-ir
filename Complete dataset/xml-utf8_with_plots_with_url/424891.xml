<plot>It's about two feuding villages, the bigwigs on a compromise path. Only, the machination of the villain of the piece fans the misunderstanding even further, leading to death and more misunderstanding. It's about Maragatham's marriage to Nallarasu from the rival family, she soon realizing that she was being used as a pawn in their game of vendetta by Nallarasu and his lecherous brother-in-law. How the matters are put in their proper perspective forms the rest of the story.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?424891</url></doc>
