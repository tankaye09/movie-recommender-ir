<plot>Miguel Delgadillo lives with his wife Berta Chavez and their four children in a small fishing village in the natural park Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca, Mexico. His passion in life is breading and training fighting cocks. He does not have much money so he manages to sustain his birds as he can, he grows and trains them in the sand of the beach and he makes their food himself. Nevertheless, thanks to his secret training technique his cocks have won a good reputation and are feared by his enemies. Now Miguel is organizing a cock-fighting event (palenque) to win money to benefit the health centre of the town. All the community has been involved preparing the event and they expect cock-fighters from around the state. While the event is organized we will meet charming characters; we will be witnesses of the world of tropical cock-fighters, we will get to know the exotic fauna and flora from the mangroves and a community that seems to belong to a magical-realistic novel.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208978</url></doc>
