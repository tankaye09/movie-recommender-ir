<plot>Have you ever had a day in your regular life where everything that came in your way seemed predicted? A 'Ride in LaLaLand' is just that. Filmed in Los Angeles streets, it is a real movie made without any concepts of directing, scripting and editing. It unfolds an episode of real life where everything fits together without premeditation. All filmed in one shot with no control over car movements, pedestrians, road signalization and most importantly, the song that was playing on the radio at the time the Record button was pushed on the cell phone... as if we should always trust what is put on our way is there for a reason.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?015349</url></doc>
