<plot>Vincent is one of the best detective in the NYPD, but he is far from one of New York's Finest. He robs and kills drug dealers, free-basing heroin to numb himself from his tortured past. Raised as a practicing Catholic, he was well on his way to becoming a devoted follower until his parents were killed in a car accident when he was six years old. Since then Vincent has descended down a dark path of destruction, acting as his own judge and jury to the evils on the streets of Brooklyn. So when his son is almost killed by a hit and run driver, Vincent sets out to kill the one responsible. But when he finds his mark, Vincent's long lost faith calls on him for the biggest challenge of his life. Does he seek vengeance knowing that it may very well seal his sons fate, or does he abide by the very faith he has spent a lifetime betraying?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?407847</url></doc>
