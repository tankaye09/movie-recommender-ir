<plot>This famous satire contrasts conservative Bengali culture with that of the colonial elite. It is the story of a young Indian who returns to his native land after a long absence. He is so mightily impressed with his foreign training that, at his parental home, he startles everybody with his quixotic notions of love and matrimony.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?070499</url></doc>
