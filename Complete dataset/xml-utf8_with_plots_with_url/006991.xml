<plot>Loraine Barr was born in 1918 and kept her sexuality secret for 88 years. When she revealed the truth in Newsweek magazine in 2007 she set the blogs ablaze and challenged us to ask: Is she really brave, courageous and bold as admirers have told her in countless letters since the story appeared? Or is she a coward - as others have written - only coming out of the closet when nothing was truly at risk? This short film tells the story of Loraine Barr, following her as she prepares to join 1800 other women on an 'Olivia' lesbian-only cruise out of San Diego.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006991</url></doc>
