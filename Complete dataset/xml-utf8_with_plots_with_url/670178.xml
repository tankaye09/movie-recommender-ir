<plot>How destiny, time and an unexpected and traumatic event can turn life upside-down? How a naive young man's free spirited attitude to life can suddenly become anguish and deep attachment to life itself? Zero is the story of Tommy, a boy unable to react to his spoilt girlfriend Giorgia's attitude and to break free from his obsession to conquer her at all costs. He is unable to comprehend and evaluate entirely his friends, his family or the people who love him for what he is rather than for what he wishes to be. Destiny will put Tommy on the horns of a dilemma. His choice will lead him to discover how experience is the only key to appreciate life's real values and to enter adulthood. 00:00 is the time when Tommy's innocence vanishes forever and the birth of the man who is inside him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?670178</url></doc>
