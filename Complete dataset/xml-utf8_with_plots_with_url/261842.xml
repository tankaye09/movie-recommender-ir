<plot>In this non-narrative short, footage of life from the Lodz Ghetto is juxtaposed with the chanting of "Kel Maleh Rachamim," a plea to God to let the souls of those "slaughtered and burned" find peace. Images include winter street scenes, women drawing water from a well, men breaking up ice, a Nazi roundup, and a mass hanging. The message of this tribute to members of Ravett's family (and to all those who perished under Nazi occupation) is "may their memory endure." Also directed by Abraham Ravett: Half Sister, The March, and Everything's For You.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261842</url></doc>
