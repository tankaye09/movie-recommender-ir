<plot>A young man thrives in his solitude and has a very clear view on the direction of his life. That is until the simple idea of getting a cactus for his work station sends him on a path of self discovery that he could never have anticipated. We follow Gabriel as he fathoms the ways of women, grinds away at his menial job and partakes in bizarre and juvenile conversations with his few idiosyncratic friends.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208308</url></doc>
