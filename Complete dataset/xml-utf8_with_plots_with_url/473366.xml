<plot>Kind-hearted yet naive Bajrang (Mehmood) drives a taxi (laila) and helps anyone he can. He is devoted to another kind-hearted gentleman and long-time bank employee by the name of Sadhuram (Om Prakash). Bajrang is attracted to a school-teacher, Vidya (Bharathi), whose brother is an artiste, Dina Nath (Kishore Kumar). One day a man claiming to be a child-hood friend of Sadhuram, named Sher Khan (Pran), enters their lives. His motive is to rob the bank where Sadhuram is employed and blame Sadhuram for this. He manipulates Sadhuram into accepting him, and moves in with him. He borrows a large sum of money from Sadhuram, and also manages to duplicate the bank's safe's key, and steals the money. The Bank Manager (Nasir Hussain) notifies the police of the robbery and Sadhuram becomes the prime suspect. In panic Sadhuram, who comes into possession of the money that Sher Khan has stolen, flees with the police on his tail. Sher Khan (alias dacoit Dilawar Khan) gets killed and his dead body ends up in the back seat of Bajrang's taxi, and Bajrang too is on the run. The only one who can clear them of this crime is Dilawar Khan, and he is - dead.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?473366</url></doc>
