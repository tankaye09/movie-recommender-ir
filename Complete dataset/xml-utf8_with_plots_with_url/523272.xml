<plot>A woman arrives home from work one evening, looking forward to relaxing and enjoying it quietly with her live-in boyfriend, John. She is jolted to find the door to her house from the garage unlocked. She is tense and suspicious as she carefully enters her home. However, she decides it's probably nothing and goes about her normal routine. Disturbances in her home continue, but she does her best to deal with her fears although she has a bad feeling. Unfortunately, her fears are realized, and we follow her on her frightful and life changing journey to her inevitable fate. It is a horror that women everywhere fear.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?523272</url></doc>
