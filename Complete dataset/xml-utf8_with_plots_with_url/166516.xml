<plot>Two Egyptians are here seen dancing what is known in their country as a sword dance. It requires lively action on the part of both to avoid being struck, for although it is a dance, they make ugly lunges at each other, which might prove fatal were they to land. Very good and very exciting.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?166516</url></doc>
