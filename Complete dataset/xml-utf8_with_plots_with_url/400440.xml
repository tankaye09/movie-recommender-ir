<plot>After a multicolored rock group introduces the cartoon, Norman Normal is asked by a boss to wine and dine a client at a nightclub party, something Normal is uncomfortable with. He talks with his dad about it who rambles on and tells Norman, "don't make waves". At the party, Norman talks with his lampshade-clad friend Leo, disapproves of a joke told by one of the guests suspecting it's about a "minority group" and is ridiculed by the bartender for only having a ginger ale. Norman leaves the party and returns us to the multicolored rock group.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?400440</url></doc>
