<plot>Episode 3 - "Forbidding Islands" On the uninhabited island of Navassa - west of Haiti, scientists from the Smithsonian Institution have made some remarkable discoveries of creatures never before recorded by science. Dubbed the "New Galapagos of the Caribbean", Navassa proved to be a very tough mission for the Quest team. Struggling with inhospitable terrain which was eventually accessed by the Quest's helicopter, this expedition made many unique discoveries including a new species of venomous spider. Expedition leader Andrew Wight came close to being bitten when trying to capture this hairy, eight-legged beastie from a cave deep in the heart of the island. In contrast to Navassa, the Quest team also researched the islands of Andros and the Dry Tortugas to compare the diversity of life on these, more commonly known Caribbean wildlife refuges.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?024326</url></doc>
