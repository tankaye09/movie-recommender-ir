<plot>After his business partner embezzles his money and leaves him penniless, Parvati's husband passes away, leaving behind two sons, Prabhakar and Sudhakar and a dumb daughter, Gauri, virtually on the verge of destitution, When Prabhakar grows up, he marries Pooja and decides to leave his aged mom, brother and sister, and move to the city. Years pass by, Sudhakar has grown up, has managed to complete schooling and is on the lookout for a job. He does get a job out of town and he re-locates. He is summoned home when his sister kills himself as she is not permitted to marry Murli. Eventually, Murli also kills himself. Then Sudhakar gets married to wealthy Padma and brings her home. Padma wants to be pampered and does not like playing second fiddle even to Parvati, which leads to disagreements in the household. Padma's pregnancy does not resolve any of the problems, and as a result Sudhakar &amp; Padma end up leaving an ailing Parvati on her own and re-locate to Padma's Dharam Das's palatial house in the city. Weeks turn into months, months turn into years, Parvati is all by herself - with the question remaining who will bid adieu to her?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068765</url></doc>
