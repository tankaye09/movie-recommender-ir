<plot>Prodced during the earliest days of television, this program was essentially a series of short stage plays performed in front of a camera. Filmed in Chicago and starring little-known local actors and actresses in half-hour dramas, this show lasted for just under a year, during which time it went through two name changes, being later known as "ABC Tele-Players" and "ABC Penthouse Players."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?019829</url></doc>
