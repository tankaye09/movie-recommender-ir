<plot>There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was produced or distributed by Universal at this time. It seems to be another bogus creation from the prolific pen of error-prone researcher Richard E. Braff, author of The Universal Silents. Most likely, it's the working title of Black Orchids, produced by Universal's Bluebird unit, which included Madison, Dyer and McDonald among its cast members and was released 1 January 1917 (not 1915).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?551201</url></doc>
