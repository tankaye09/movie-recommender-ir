<plot>Fred Anderson's car stalls on an abandoned dirt-track road in the high desert. He's frustrated. He yells at God. He thinks about suicide and rejects it. He leaves the car, slamming the door behind him and stomping away, still yelling at God. He turns and is shocked to see a large screen behind him offering to install "life." He accepts, and, like a computer program, takes him through a series of prompts. He chooses features such as "love" and "wealth." The program starts its download and Fred exalts. Is life finally in store for him?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?266492</url></doc>
