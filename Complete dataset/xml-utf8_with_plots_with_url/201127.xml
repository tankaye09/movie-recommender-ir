<plot>Arthur Yu (Kelvin Yu) has problems. His girlfriend, Megan (Jessica Skerritt), is leaving to study abroad in China for a year, leaving him to waste another college vacation working at his dad's (Gedde Watanabe) fortune cookie factory. Instead of telling Megan that he'll wait for her, Arthur makes the biggest mistake of his life and dumps the girl of his dreams. As he suffers through another summer at the factory, Arthur's fortunes become more and more depressing: You will die alone. Two words: colon cancer. It doesn't take him long to nearly ruin his father's business. Finally, at wits end, Arthur decides that the only way to get Megan back is to write her a love letter before she heads overseas. But when his e-mail gets mixed up with his fortunes, suddenly every cookie at every restaurant reveals a piece of Arthur's broken heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?201127</url></doc>
