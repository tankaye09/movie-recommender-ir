<plot>Teenaged Wally is attracted to two girls. One is Ginny, the local "bad girl" with a reputation. The other is Caroline, a virginal young thing who is everything Ginny isn't. Wally would dearly like to see for himself if Ginny lives up to her reputation, but finds himself somehow attracted to Caroline's white-bread wholesomeness. Torn between his lust for the slutty but available Ginny and his attraction to the hot but "not until we're married" Caroline, Wally knows that things are getting to the point where he has to come to a decision. What to do, what to do . . .</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?044988</url></doc>
