<plot>Woody tries to watch his favorite TV quiz show, "Win the Whole Wide World" despite the fact it is constantly interrupted by commercials for the stupidest products, such as "Hair Goop Hair Oil" which turns a bald man into a hairy gorilla and "Scat Fat" tablets which reduce an obese man until he's as thin as a sheet of paper. Finally, the question, "Who is buried in Grant's tomb", is asked. Woody tries to submit his answer, Napoleon, to the studio only to discover it is incorrect (George Washington is the correct answer). However, they still reward him with a free trip...to the South Pole.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?057840</url></doc>
