<plot>Australia, 1994. A safe place - far from war and torment. A different world to the Europe of 1943. An old man, Erwin Ressler suffers in the drear of the present. He is drawn back to the memories of his past. A past where choices where made, and important decisions were to shape his life. As a worker on the German Railways of World War II Europe, Ressler's eyes were a window to the horrors of that time. He remembers it as a time of trust between a man and an empire, and a man and his friend.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?261787</url></doc>
