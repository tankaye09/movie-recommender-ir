<plot>In stunts not allowed on TV, I wreak havoc on a mission to find the very best car of all time by putting the fastest and most fun cars through a punishing pace of trials and tribulations. But whats better, I hunt down, and kill, the most useless and awful ones, for sport! Relish as you watch the first ever 3-way continental drag race on a public road. Stagger as I push the brand new Ferrari 430 to its limits. Gasp as I sentence a Pontiac Sunfire to death. Grin as you watch a Hyundai Elantra being blown to pieces in a firestorm of metal and glass. In this DVD, you get an orgy of burnt rubber and howling tires. You'll see challenges that would make grown men wet their pants: I attempt to find the top speed of a Dodge Viper. I play chicken with a Mercedes SL500. I strive to power slide a Porsche 911 Turbo at 100mph. Plus, I kill the worst car ever by crashing it. On Purpose. And, see how the Dodge SRT-4 tries to kill me.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?099906</url></doc>
