<plot>Of course, we mean the Army trumpet, but not only that. There is also a Christian myth of the trumpet that will raise the dead on Judgment Day. Is there a more obvious connection between war and death than that? Man and army, soldier and war, fear and the killing of your likes - those are the energy-giving motifs of the film. A historian, a theologian, and an officer and a writer carry on their monologue contemplations in a never-ending argument. Nobody loves war. Why is then everyone willing to go when the trumpet calls at dawn?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?445267</url></doc>
