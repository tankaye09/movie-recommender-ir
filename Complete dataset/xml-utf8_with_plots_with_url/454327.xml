Ranbir is heartbroken. Ranbir's friend, Rajinder Singh (Ashok Kumar), also a police inspector, comes to console Ranbir, and they together decide to go undercovr as Rana and Raja to locate Teja, who has many hide-outs within India as well as abroad, and also goes by many assumed names, including Heeralal. These two are indirectly aided by police inspector Vijay (Puneet Issar) and his girlfriend Geeta (Alokh Soundh), whose dad was killed by Teja's goons. Vijay has a rather spoiled brother, Shakti Singh (Shakti Kapoor), who ultimately ends up on the wrong side of the law, and is a disappointment to both Vijay and his mom (Chand Usmani). Teja finds out about Vijay and decides to lure him with the charms of one of his girls, Lucky (Madhu Malhotra).
