<plot>Three interlocking tales of damsels in distress. An urban scene: a man sees a woman fall off the roof of the neighboring apartment building. A Western scene: a cowboy hears a woman tied to the railroad tracks and an approaching train. And a fantasy scene: seven dwarfs, reading the tale of Snow White, sense a witch passing by with a poison apple. Each races to save their respective "miss" (and sometimes get involved with the stories of the others); each runs into a staggering number of obstacles along the way (including a steadily dwindling supply of dwarves). Who will succeed?</plot><plot>Three interlocking tales of damsels in distress. An urban scene: a man sees a woman fall off the roof of the neighboring apartment building.
