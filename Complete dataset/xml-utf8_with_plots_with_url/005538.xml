<plot>On his fortieth birthday, Trevor Day learns that his film has been accepted to the Sundance Film Festival. He invites his actors, washed-up soap opera stars Stacey Harris and her ex-husband Rick Reeves, to accompany him on a road trip to the festival. Just as each of life's decisions brings a few surprises, their misadventures along the way prove to be much more than they bargained for, particularly when they take a "short cut" via old US Highway 40.</plot><plot>On his fortieth birthday, Trevor Day learns that his film has been accepted to the Sundance Film Festival.
