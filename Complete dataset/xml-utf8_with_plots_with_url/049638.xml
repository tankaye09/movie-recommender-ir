<plot>Imagine being invited to sit at the chef's personal table in one of the country's top restaurants. Only At the Chef's Table and host Alex Boylan provide your backstage pass to experience the chef's realm as you've never seen it before. There's no studio set kitchen with a chef standing behind the counter - instead you'll get a front-row seat to see the exhilarating, fast-paced life of a chef at a 5-star restaurant. From being down at the docks at 5 am for the catch of the day, to devising the evening's menu with the cooks, to tasting the sauces, you'll get a behind-the-scenes peak at how these masterful chefs' artfully crafted dishes come to life. Diners at the chef's table are treated to an experience like none other, tasting dishes presented by the chefs themselves. Pull up a chair - At the Chef's Table.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049638</url></doc>
