<plot>Sam the white-washer pines for the affluent Lindy, but she has dumped him in favor of another. Sam finds a large sum of money, and goes to New York to enjoy a shopping spree, buying new clothes, jewelry and a car with a driver. Back home, Lindy flips for Sam and his newfound wealth, and dumps the rival. Sam throws an engagement party where he indulges in a friendly game of cards with his former rival and another man, who unbeknownst to Sam, is a card shark. Sam loses his bankroll, jewels, clothes and car in short order, Lindy runs off with the card shark, and Sam resigns himself once again to a life of white-washing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010518</url></doc>
