<plot>Adam Hayward (Robert Montgomery), a successful New York City defense lawyer, receives a cable that the British war buddy who saved his life at Anzio Beach is now in trouble with the law in England. Taking the advice of his secretary to go to England rather than wire money, Adam arrives in his friend's village to find him about to stand trial for the murder of the hired stable-hand, Lawrence. Hayward learns that a witness exists who can testify that his friend, Baxter, shot Lawrence in self-defense. But the other witness is a woman who fled the scene and will not want to expose herself by coming forward. Though Hayward suspects Alex, the youthful war-widow daughter-in-law of Colonel Summerfield (himself a widower) he soon discovers that the mystery woman is the young and impressionable Sandy Summerfield, whom he must see to it is brought to the witness stand. As he is leaving the village to catch his plane, Hayward stops at Summerfield Manor to say goodbye. As he does so, he manages to bring father and daughter together. The film closes as Adam and Alex, deep in conversation, walk off into the garden.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?667625</url></doc>
