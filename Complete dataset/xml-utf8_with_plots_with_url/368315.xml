<plot>A typical Sunday morning for our noble savage Michael Bell starts with a hangover and ends with a hangover and a mess of problems. Recovering from the previous night's excesses, Mike realizes he has nothing to wear to work the next day. Aided by the wisdom of Harlem's Frank the Tailor, he arranges clean clothes and is saved. Saved, though, for another backbreaking week at a corporate job which keeps his life dangling in limbo.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?368315</url></doc>
