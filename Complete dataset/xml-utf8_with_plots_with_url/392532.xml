<plot>A small town girl, new to the city and needing a friend, is enjoying a ride in the park on her classic bicycle. She meets a young man, running and carrying a tattered box containing the manuscript for his latest novel. He's on the way to meet his publisher. She is intrigued by his story and loans him her bike so he won't be late for the meeting. He rides off, promising to return. He rides to the back door of a workshop and is greeted by two workers. They play a guessing game about how he got the bike and have a few laughs. He enters the front of the building - a bicycle shop. He places a sales tag on the bike and asks a worker to watch the store as he wants to work on his novel. The young lady waits at the park for his return.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?392532</url></doc>
