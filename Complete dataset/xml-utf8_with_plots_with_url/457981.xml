<plot>Near the center of this scene we see the regimental surgeon directing the movements of the Ambulance Corps. Tenderly they pick up the unfortunates and place them in the ambulance. The numbers disabled show the battle has been a hot one, and many a poor fellow, if he survives with injuries, will carry to his grave the scars honorably acquired in his country's cause.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?457981</url></doc>
