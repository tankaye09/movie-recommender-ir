<plot>Widower Raka lives a poor lifestyle in Dhangaon, along with two daughters, Bina and Asha, and makes a living as a farmer in a region controlled by Thakur Harnam Singh. Due to drought there is famine, the entire village pleads with Harnam for food, and he agrees to do so provided one person from each family tends his fields for free. Most villagers agree, but Raka doesn't, and he gets killed. Before dying, he entrusts his daughter to a crippled ex-army Colonel. Years later, both girls have grown up, while the region is still controlled by Harnam as well as his son, Ranjeet. There appears to be no hope for the hapless villagers who continue slaving for Harnam. Then Dr. Ajay, the son of Sarju, one of Harnam's bonded laborers, returns home. He witnesses the plight of his fellow-villagers and his dad, and decides to challenge Harnam and Ranjeet - not realizing that no one from the village will dare to stand with him, and he, as well as his aunt and dad face nothing but torture and death by the oppressive Thakur, his son, and their goons.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?068320</url></doc>
