<plot>A story of money, power and politics in the age of sprawl,"Megmall" explores the controversy behind one of America's biggest shopping malls, the Palisades Center in West Nyack, New York. In 1996, the biggest mall developer in the Northeast broke ground on a toxic dump, one mile from the filmmakers' homes. That move ignited a citizen uprising which lasted almost 20 years. With dramatic verite footage, in-depth interviews with key players in the dispute, as well as provocative commentary from leading urban critics, James Howard Kunstler ("The Geography of Nowhere") and Roberta Brandes Gratz ("The Living City"), "Megamall" gives viewers the real story behind the changing shape of America's landscape.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363988</url></doc>
