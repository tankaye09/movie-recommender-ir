<plot>A Western cowboy attempts to flirt with a veiled young lady sitting on a bench in the garden. After considerable persuasion she is induced to raise her veil, but to the cowboy's amazement she reveals a hideous face. The cowboy leaves in disgust, but his place is quickly taken by a dapper Eastern youth who removes the mask from the girl's face, and the two enjoy a hearty laugh over the cowboy's discomfiture.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010673</url></doc>
