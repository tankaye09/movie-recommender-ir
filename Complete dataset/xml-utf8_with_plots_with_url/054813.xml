<plot>Baby is seated in his high chair, and at the table close by father is enjoying a light lunch. Both have bottles, but baby's is milk, while Father's is Piper Heidsieck. Baby is in a good humor when the meal starts, but becomes dissatisfied with his own bottle, and when refused the champagne, he digs is knuckles into his little eyes and bawls as only babies can. Mother finally rescues baby and brings the meal to an end. A pretty picture of home life and a sure favorite with ladies and children.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?054813</url></doc>
