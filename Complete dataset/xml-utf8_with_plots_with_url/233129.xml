<plot>A wife and a husband are in bed. Both are unhappy with one another. They can't communicate. It seems all they can do is avoid one another, spiritually and physically. Then, the basis of reality begins to shifts as the wife garners courage to write out the words she's been keeping from him. She emotionally awakens her husband's compassion and, ultimately, his heart.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?233129</url></doc>
