<plot>In this charming animated story, young May wants a dog more than anything else in the world. May thinks about dogs all the time. She talks about them, reads about them and covers the walls of her bedroom with dog pictures. But every time she asks her parents for a puppy, they tell her to wait till she's older. All her clever ploys meet with a resounding "NO." May remembers her father's words when she was little and learning to roller skate: "If at first you don't succeed, try again." So she follows his advice in fact, she comes up with an ingenious idea to persuade Mom and Dad to change their minds. This fun-filled, offbeat story about a girl's hopes and dreams will enchant young viewers and their parents.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?253282</url></doc>
