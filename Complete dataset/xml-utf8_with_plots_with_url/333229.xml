<plot>A single guy in search of the perfect woman. Marty is a nice guy, but he finds something wrong with every woman that he dates. His best friend Bob criticizes him because Marty can't even decide what he wants. But when one of the women confronts Marty and sizes him up, he goes into a funk that only Bob can snap him out of. It seems that Marty's problems are much more complicated than just being a perfectionist.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?333229</url></doc>
