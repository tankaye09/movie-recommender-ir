<plot>The new maid is very pretty and interests the master to an unusual degree as he sits alone at the table taking an early breakfast. He thinks it not amiss to steal a kiss, and is just getting away with the good when his wife, clad in her "robe de nuit" comes in unexpectedly and creates a scene.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578966</url></doc>
