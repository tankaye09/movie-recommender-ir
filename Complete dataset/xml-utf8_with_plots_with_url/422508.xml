<plot>In the Kingdom of Nepal, more than 12,000 people have died since the Maoist rebels launched an armed struggle in 1996 to replace the Monarchy with a republican regime. For small businesses, making a living in this unstable climate has become increasingly difficult &amp; dangerous. A Fair Trade company - Dakini, established a direct trade link with a Nepalese paper producer to support their business and in October 2004, a group of Cornish trekkers set out to raise funds to support this initiative by walking to Mount Everest Base Camp. Paper Mountain is a visually stunning, evocative insight into the lives and working conditions of factory workers, farmers and porters struggling to make a living in the Himalayas and Kathmandu.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?422508</url></doc>
