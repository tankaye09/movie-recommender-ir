<plot>Based on a true story, this film tells of an expedition into the Amazon jungle to find an archaeologist who had vanished three years previously. They run into a tribe of warlike headhunters, who are determined to add the expedition members' heads to their collection (in the real story, the archaeologist was found to have been murdered by a tribe of Brazilian headhunters).</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?478886</url></doc>
