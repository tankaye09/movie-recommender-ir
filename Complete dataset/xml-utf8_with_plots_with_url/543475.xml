<plot>THE BIG AUTO PLANT is a live-action adventure that takes kids around the world - from the design studios and engine plant in Stuttgart, Germany to the ultra-modern assembly plant in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama - to see how a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV is designed and built. The video shows how the car is created from a sheet of paper all the way through the engineering and assembly process. There is even a special animated section on how an engine works! Other parts of the program show the wind tunnel, the crash tests, and even a wild ride on the outdoor test track. The video was filmed digitally on-location in Germany and the USA. It shows the fascinating story of how a modern automobile is designed and built. Children can see how hundreds of people on two different continents work together to create a new car.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?543475</url></doc>
