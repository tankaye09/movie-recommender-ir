<plot>Sylvia Faddis, a German woman, born into a high ranking military family during WWII discovers at age 5 the truth about the Holocaust. She then vows to leave Germany when she grows up and never to return. When she makes the connection between the plight of the Jews in WWII and the Tibetans she makes her second vow at age 9: to dedicate her life to helping the Dalai Lama get Tibet back. What follows is a lifelong quest for a new family within the Tibetans. And she fulfills her vow to the Dalai Lama by her help in building a hostel and monastery in the Himalayas to give shelter to the fleeing Tibetans.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?526010</url></doc>
