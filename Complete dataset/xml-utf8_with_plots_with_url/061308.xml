<plot>"Grand Naval Review in New York Harbor, August 20, 1898, of the United States fleet, which destroyed the fleet of the Spanish Admiral Cervera at Santiago, Cuba. These were made especially at great expense and by special permission of the New York authorities, and they are the grandest naval films ever produced, showing the United States fleet of battle-scarred warships as they passed in triumphal procession from Tompkinsville, Staten Island, to Grant's Tomb in Riverside Park, New York City, and back to Staten Island, accompanied by hundreds of gaily decorated river steamers, excursion boats, tugs, and showing views along North River, of New York and New Jersey. The naval heroes can be seen on their respective ships. None but those engaged in the battles were allowed on board, except the United States Cabinet officers and their ladies, who were on board the cruiser New York with Rear Admiral W.T. Simpson, in command of the fleet. Everyone should have these great pictures, as they are very popular and will draw big crowds."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?061308</url></doc>
