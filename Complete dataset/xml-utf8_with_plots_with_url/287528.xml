<plot>Neeta and Sapna are two friends who live in Bombay, India. Neeta is married to a blue collared worker, who first loses the use of his legs in an accident, and then subsequently turns blind. Sapna, whose dad has passed away, now lives with her mom, and her foster father, Pramod. In order to make money for a living, Neeta becomes a prostitute, and wants Sapna to improve her lifestyle. Sapna accompanies her, is molested by Heera, and rescued by a taxi-driver, Amitabh Sharma. Both Amitabh and Sapna fall in love and want to get married. Before that could happen, Sapna is arrested by the Police for assaulting Pramod, she is tried in Court, where she remains silent, and gets a six month jail sentence. When she is discharged, Amitabh tells her that her mom has been arrested and is serving life in jail for killing Pramod. When both are about to get married, Amitabh's dad objects to this marriage, as he does not want any relationship with a former jailbird and a woman who mother is a murderer. Unable to stand in the Sharma family way, Sapna decides to leave Bombay and re-locates to Calcutta where she establishes herself as a stage actress, while Neeta, whose husband passes away, is arrested by the Police for prostituting. The question remains, will Sapna and Amitabh ever get back together again, and if they do, will Amitabh's family accept Sapna?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?287528</url></doc>
