She is confused when her father comes back after a fifteen-year absence and finds it difficult to accept him. 25 year-old Keun-woo is a telephone mechanic who enjoys eavesdropping while at work. He gets to know a woman through eavesdropping and falls in love with her. However, he is quite lost as to how he should express his feelings for her.
