<plot>Jeff Karram has it all - he's young, good-looking, successful, and as the co-owner of a rising Internet company, has an incredibly bright future. But burning deep within this twenty-three year old entrepreneur is an unusual dream - to leave the snows of Toronto to become...a professional surfer. He gives up everything he has and sets a deadline of two years to accomplish his dream. He travels the globe searching for the best waves but struggles to develop as a surfer and worse, is hit by a devastating injury. But his life takes an incredible turn when he meets his future wife - a supermodel - and finally competes with the pros. Breakbound is Jeff's amazing story of courage and adventure set against the backdrop of some of the most beautiful scenery on the planet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?082134</url></doc>
