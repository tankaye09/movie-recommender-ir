<plot>The second of the nine-films series based on "The Higgins Family" from Republic, with James and Lucile Gleason in the first seven and replaced by Roscoe Karns and Ruth Donnelly in the last two entries, "Meet the Missus" and "Petticoat Politics." In this one Joe Higgins buys his wife Lil an expensive ring for their 25th wedding anniversary on the installment plan, and loses his job at the candy factory owned by Mr. Ellis on the same day. The latter's son Bill also announces his intentions of marrying the Higgins' daughter, Jean, over the protests of Ellis and his snooty wife. Joe loses the ring and his dumb son Sidney thinks it is in a package of a new nickel candy bar, and offers a reward for its return. The sales of the candy sky-rocket. Elsewhere, Grandpa, concerned over the financial affairs of the Higgins family, decides to marry the rich widow Jones who has been pursuing him for years.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385145</url></doc>
