<plot>Jack: A flash fantasy was a rock opera. Writer unknown Produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in early 70's in Canada. Possibly Gilda's earliest TV production. Aired in US, on Public Television in mid-late 1970's after SNL had made Gilda a household name. Viewed and made audio tape in NYC from WNET Channel 13 (wnet.org) Plot: Jack delt with a deck of cards, with lots of Jacks (and Jills) Jack was the jack of hearts (with a full, trusting heart) Jill (Gilda) owned a cow, named moo,"because even though the cow laughed and cried and talked and shouted, it all came out as, MOO!" Jack and Jill are taken advantage of by the Jack of Spades. Different musical styles are portrayed by the different characters. I have this on an Audio tape taped from the channel13 show. A search on CBC and WNET13.org showed no hits for this name.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?272233</url></doc>
