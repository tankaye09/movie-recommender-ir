<plot>In the middle of the mountains, Helen leaves her boyfriend. Her fantasies take her beyond the limits of her own universe and she sets off to discover the unknown. Everything looks like a dream. Even the things she knows get a touch of magic and seem surrealistic, since she perceives them in a new light, with total freedom. But finally she doesn't dare make the ultimate step. She is caught up by the security and habits of her everyday life. Thus the experience becomes an excursion limited in time. What she will remember are memories from which she can learn something.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?185129</url></doc>
