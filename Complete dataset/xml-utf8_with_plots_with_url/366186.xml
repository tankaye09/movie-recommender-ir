<plot>Roopa lives a wealthy lifestyle with her husband, Prakash Chandra, who works for her dad, Manoharlal Verma, and a daughter named Sharda alias Pinky. Roopa and Prakash do not get along and Roopa suspects that Prakash is having an affair. Her suspicious nature gets a boost when a woman named Sharda Dayal Sharma moves into a house next door. Roopa starts vile rumors about Sharda having an affair with Prakash. As a result of these rumors, no one is willing to marry Sharda, she is mocked by everyone in the community, and even loses her bank job. Sharda decides to teach Roopa a lesson by moving her belongings in to her house, claiming that she is indeed Prakash's mistress. The surprising thing is Prakash agrees to this arrangement and permits her to live with them. Unable to assert herself, Roopa leaves the house, and goes to live with her parents. Things are going well with Sharda, until one day when Pinky goes missing. Sharda hectically attempts to locate Pinky, but in vain. Then the police arrive to arrest Sharda on the charge of kidnapping Pinky and possibly killing her. The police indicate that they can prove that Sharda did indeed kidnap Pinky as she has a motive of continuing to live with Prakash as his mistress and wanted Pinky out of the way. The question remains did Sharda really have Pinky kidnapped and killed? If so, what effect is this going to have on her relationship with Prakash?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?366186</url></doc>
