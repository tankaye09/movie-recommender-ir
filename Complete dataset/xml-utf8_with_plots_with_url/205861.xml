<plot>One of Kurdistan's most famous artists, Fuad moved from Iraq to Italy years ago to study sculpting. Just after he moved, Saddam Hussein took control of Iraq and outlawed art, and Fuad couldn't return home for 18 years. After the first Gulf War, Fuad was finally able to return home to find his country in ruins. Now, the new Kurdish prime minister has asked Fuad to design a monument to the Unknown Kurdish Soldier, but political pressure might keep the project from ever being realized.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?205861</url></doc>
