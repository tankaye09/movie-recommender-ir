<plot>Highliner is a film that attempts to embody the California Urchin Diver experience, tradition, struggle, and soul. The movie examines the variety of subtle differences that make a California urchin diver's life so unique. We aim for our audience to plunge into and explore the culture of commercial urchin divers and see how they interact within their unique community, balancing work and family, and transition through an array of newly imposed environmental restrictions. The characters lead us past the traditional fisherman stereotypes, revealing the possible end of an era and creation of a new breed of environmentally conscious divers.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?231145</url></doc>
