<plot>Notorious bad-boy painter Attila Richards Lukacs got the lyrics to Leonard Cohen's famous song backwards when he moved from Berlin to take over Manhattan. But if conquering New York was on his agenda, what he finds instead is a harrowing journey through hell. His plans to rule the world's toughest art scene take a back seat to an artistic mid-life crisis and a drug addiction.  His world upside down, will Attila's gift for painting be strong enough to pull him from the brink of disaster?  Drawing Out The Demons unflinchingly brings the audience to one mans' hazardous crossroad of destiny, where Attila is sure to meet either greatness, or death.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159228</url></doc>
