<plot>Dean, the supervisor at a small data-processing company, arrives at work on the day he's promised Eric, a younger colleague, that he'll stop smoking. They go outside to smoke, and Dean says it's his last. Eric bets him $100 that he won't last the night. Later that day, Dean has to lay off an older temp worker, Rita. That night, Dean can't sleep: he paces, he tears up cigarettes, he goes to a bar to see his friend Theresa. He's unbearable, so she leaves. Later that night, Dean succumbs to his addiction, but the next day, after he has paid off Eric, he goes outside for a smoke, and it just may save his life.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?320401</url></doc>
