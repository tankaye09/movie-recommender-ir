<plot>Spencer Smith and David Jones considered themselves to be at the top of their game, with each con they pulled off being more daring and elaborate than the last, until that is...they were caught. Released from prison and still hounded by the police inspector who put them there, the two were taken in by Spencer's Aunt, a self-proclaimed fortuneteller, medium and psychic, but unfortunately for her, she was unable to predict the collision between herself and a double-decker bus. Spencer soon discovers that his Aunts mystical power was derived from an ancient book of the occult which has the power to raise the dead and return them to their natural state. The two quickly see the potential in capitalizing in on this somewhat morbid venture, but what they don't realize is that meddling with the unknown may just be their downfall...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?214347</url></doc>
