<plot>Ranjan (Abhi Bhattacharya) is the only son of a very wealthy man, and is in love with Chanda (Chandabai) who he once accidently ran over with his car. This love affair is not known to Ranjan's dad, who wants him to marry Lata (Geeta Bali) who is a simple yet pretty village girl. Ranjan reluctantly agrees to marry Lata. And on the marriage night makes it clear to Lata that he has married her to please his dad; and even introduces Lata to his true love Chanda, and asks Lata to keep this secret from his dad. Meanwhile back in the village everyone thinks that Lata is happily married. Another fellow villager, Rashad (Sunder), a struggling and unsuccessful poet, comes to the big city and tries to con a wealthy blind woman into making her believe that he is her long lost son, as he himself can be rich and marry his love, Geeta (Shammi) who is Lata's sister. Will Ranjan finally accept Lata as his lawful wife, if so what will happen to Chanda?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?056151</url></doc>
