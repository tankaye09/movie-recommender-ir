<plot>Dottie and Madge are friends that share something in common... they are both widows of golfers. When they get together at their country club, they're other girlfriend can't make it. Dottie and Madge order martinis. Madge tells Dottie that they have to get drunk to be brave. Dottie doesn't understand what she means but still keeps ordering the drinks. After Dottie unintentionally calls a martini - a "martuni", Madge decides they've had enough. Thus they embarked on their longest journey together. Madge brings out the urn that holds the remains of her husband, Harold and tells Dottie that they need to spread his ashes "in the sandpit on the right side of the 16th green." So drunken Madge and Dottie steal a golf cart and go through an odyssey of laughs to find out the truth about their husbands and become closer than ever.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?381255</url></doc>
