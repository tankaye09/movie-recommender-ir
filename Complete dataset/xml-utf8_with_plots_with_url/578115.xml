<plot>This is one of the famous black art tricks. A large urn sets in the middle of the picture. Several young ladies are standing about the urn when Mephistopheles appears. He waves his mystic wand and causes the urn to disappear. He then commands the seven young ladies to take their places upon the stand which the urn occupied. By waving his hand he causes the young ladies to disappear in a cloud of smoke. He then causes the scene to change to an artist's boudoir, when a fashionably attired young man appears and makes love to one of the young ladies who happens to be there. As he is about to encircle her with his arms, she disappears mysteriously and Mephistopheles appears in her place. The[sic] commands the floor to open under the bucolic young man, who disappears. The young man then reappears and is making his toilet before a mirror, when Mephisto again returns and transforms the scene to Hades, where the mystic urn reappears. The beautiful young lady who occupied the studio is commanded to step out of the urn, and one after the other the seven girls attired in tights are taken from the boiling urn in a very mysterious manner. This is one of the most mystifying of the black art pictures.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578115</url></doc>
