<plot>An unusual family and a staff of two are preparing a party on their cosy mansion. There is the mother and the father, who don't seem to have a normal marriage anymore, there's the daughter, Lena, who has a disease and will soon leave the house for medical treatment in Switzerland, and her husband Harry, who has a mysterious past. Afang and Xiang are the Asian housekeepers. They have a son, Jai, who is loved by everyone and who keeps the house alive. By occasion, the family plays a bizarre game: when someone rings a bell, everyone has to undress as quikly as possible, dive in the swimming pool, and grab the wooden fish in the pool. Some guests join the family for a farewell-part for Lena. There's Ushi, Harry's lawyer, who knows something about Harry Lena doesn't know, Eddie, a friend of Harry and his new girlfriend Pol, and at last, there are two policemen who are in fact unwelcome. They come to get Afang &amp; Xiang, because they were once involved in a war, and they have to testifie. By the end of the day, everybody is nervous and tensions gets high. How will this end?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219135</url></doc>
