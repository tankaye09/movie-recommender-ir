<plot>A baby named George rises to his true potential. A voice-over narration in the style of 1950s educational films, takes us through the life of George, from infancy to extensive world power. The images are film clips from middle-American scenes, illustrating a feckless life of sports, drinking, exercise, unearned success, and the privileges of wealth. A downward spiral ends with the appearance of God, to save George and enable him to run for elective office: thanks to will power and nuclear energy, George's story is one of fulfillment.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?540071</url></doc>
