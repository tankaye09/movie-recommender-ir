<plot>The documentary which has been broadcast on public television stations across the country, explores the creation of a New York landmark by famed builder Robert Moses. Conceived at a time when park development was little more than an afterthought for civic planners, Jones Beach was a revolutionary concept; a seaside playground for the urban masses. Built against tremendous opposition from xenophobic locals, the park was the engineering feat of its time. When opened in 1929, it featured parking for over ten-thousand cars, bathhouses constructed of stone and a boardwalk designed to give visitors the feeling of being aboard an ocean liner. Nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Cultural and Historical Programming, the film details the park's timeless appeal through rare newsreels, evocative photographs, period music and in-depth interviews. The documentary is narrated by noted actor Eli Wallach.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?279162</url></doc>
