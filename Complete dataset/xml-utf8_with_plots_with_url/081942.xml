<plot>This short looks at the life Michel Ney, who fought at Napoleon's side and was made a Marshall of France. Ney rejoined Napoleon's army after the emperor escaped from Elba and returned to France. He was convicted of treason and, according to history, executed by firing squad in 1815. The film presents the possibility that Ney's execution was a ruse, after which he escaped to America, became a teacher in North Carolina, and died in 1821.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?081942</url></doc>
