<plot>When Norman Tickle, an over-sized and over-aged teenager, is finally kicked out of home by his weary mother and dictatorial stepfather, there is nothing left to do but for him to take to the road in search of that big adventure called 'adulthood'. Norman and his best friend, Arty Harris, hook up with a multi-national crowd of backpackers heading for the Western Highlands, and a season of "waiting on" and "bar" work in a remote Highland hotel. But they are not "well met". In the dilapidated, musty and thoroughly unhygienic hotel run by "Clan Pertwee", Norman discovers how quickly the transition from boy to man is needed. With summer season about to start, and a huge amount of work still to do, the travelers set about their tasks with gusto. But such enthusiasm is unlikely to last in the face of the Pertwees' perverse gastronomic taste.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?246986</url></doc>
