<plot>"Don't Drink Poison" blends the humorous with the macabre in a story that pays homage to many famous thrillers of years past. The film centers on Noelle, a mid-twenties female recently separated from her cheating boyfriend. Noelle's crass, trash-talking best friend, Tori, takes her out to a nightclub in hopes of helping her to get over her failed relationship. There, she runs into Blake, a charming and handsome young man who's surprisingly alone at the bar. After ice-breaking conversation, flirtation and several successive drinks, the two hit it off and, hormonally intoxicated, hit the dance floor. To her unfortunate surprise, however, Noelle awakens the following morning to discover that she's in store for much more than just a satisfying fling...and that nice looks can hide dark secrets.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?155480</url></doc>
