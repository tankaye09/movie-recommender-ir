<plot>"He goes by many names..." On the surface 'Armen Victorian' seems like a regular guy. He lives in Nottingham with his wife and two children and his occupations have been variously listed as insurance salesman, shop assistant and cleaner. But dig a little deeper and Armen's life starts to resemble that of a latter-day Walter Mitty.   Diplomat, adventurer, UFO investigator, crop circle researcher, intelligence officer - was this the secret life of a Nottingham shop assistant?   His world is a shadowy world of counter-espionage, disinformation, subterfuge, spooks, spies, lies and the keeping and revealing of secret knowledge.   The Mythologist explores Armen's life and his impact on the murky and mythic realms of paranormal research.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?578306</url></doc>
