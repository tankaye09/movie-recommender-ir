<plot>Armchair detectives and forensic science junkies get the opportunity to solve real cases each week on Court TV's "I, Detective". This half-hour series airs weekly and gives viewers the opportunity to follow clues, find evidence and learn how this information is used to solve some of the most intriguing criminal investigations. "I, Detective" combines the elements of documentary, murder mystery, and quiz shows. Through an interactive series of multiple choice questions, "I, Detective" challenges viewers to examine the same evidence, suspects, motives and witness statements that actual investigators consider in their quest to solve the crime. "Court TV's viewers enjoy the challenge of piecing together clues, accepting or rejecting possible evidence, and participating in the investigation," observes Art Bell, Executive Vice President, Programming and Marketing, Court TV. "The questions included in "I, Detective" give our viewers a chance to be active participants in the investigation. They examine the crime scene, evaluate evidence, and attempt to correctly answer questions that real criminologists and forensic specialists ask themselves as they solve a crime." "I, Detective" is produced by Michael Hoff Productions.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?255174</url></doc>
