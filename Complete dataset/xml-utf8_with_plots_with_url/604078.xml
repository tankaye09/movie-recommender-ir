<plot>This is without doubt the finest water and steamboat picture you would wish to see. It shows the famous Marching Club of Chicago on one of the great lake steamers leaving the pier for a day's outing, and to witness the boat races on the lakes. Fine, sharp, clear; bound to bring applause; a great hit wherever shown.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?604078</url></doc>
