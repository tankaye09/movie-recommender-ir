<plot>The tomb of Lazarus is seen here with Martha and Mary Magdalene, surrounded by relatives and friends, who are mourning the death of Lazarus. The group is apart from the sepulcher as Jesus and His disciples are seen passing by. Mary and Martha, with animated dialogue, beseech Jesus to restore Lazarus to life. Christ is seen crossing to the tomb, and by a motion to two of His disciples the sepulcher is opened and Jesus bids Lazarus to "come forth." Lazarus is seen to rise up from the tomb and come forth in his winding sheet.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?425388</url></doc>
