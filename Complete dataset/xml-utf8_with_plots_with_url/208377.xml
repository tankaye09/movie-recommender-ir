<plot>Led by his grandchildren, an old man walks along the seaside to where four white crosses stand on the sand. They are grave markers, each marked with a name. Gackt: 1973 - 2007 is the name on one. Lighting a cigarette, the old man starts to speak. "Do you remember, when the five of us, when all of us, were shining?" And, on the sand next to the grave of his friend, the old man tucks a picture, taken in the days gone by. It is of five friends, five members of the world's most powerful clan: the Gackt Job. Thus begins 'The Sixth Day &amp; Seventh Night,' the astounding musical journey into Gackt's mystical world. A meticulously filmed and excitement packed concert, Japanese rock star Gackt outdoes even his amazing previous performances with his longest and most complicated show to date. New bassist Ju-ken joins the group along with a record number of twelve dancers, and Gackt performs many fan-favorites and numerous chart-topping hits covering his five years of solo recording. Filled with heartfelt lyrics and powerful melodies, brilliant dancing and an emotional, moving ending, Gackt's stage has never shone brighter then on this day, and this night.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?208377</url></doc>
