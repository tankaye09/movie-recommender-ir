<plot>Pierre Rameau, the son of a poor gate-keeper, becomes the foremost physician and surgeon in Paris. Conchita, his wife who he loves above everything else in the world, dies leaving an infant daughter, Pamela. Rameau is inconsolable and keeps the room that Conchita died in inviolate, visiting it only on the anniversary of his wife's death. Twenty years later on one of these visits he discovers, among one of Conhita's letters, proof that she had been unfaithful to him and that Pamela, the girl he had raised from an infant to womanhood, was not his child. The shock drives him out of his mind, and he drives Pamela from his home, refusing to ever see her again. Dr. Talavanne, his best friend, informs him that Pamela is dying and only Rameau's skills as a physician can save her.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?158630</url></doc>
