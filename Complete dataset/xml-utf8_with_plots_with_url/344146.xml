<plot>It's an unwritten rule that director of film and stage plays do not publically attack critics on their views. But in 1988 'Louis Miehe-Renard' (qv) decided he indeed would do just that, and even on public television. In this tv-special he discusses how he feels about a critic who written a extremely bad review of a stage play Miehe-Renard had directed, which resulted in in a complete flop. Miehe-Renard even sued the critic and the newspaper.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344146</url></doc>
