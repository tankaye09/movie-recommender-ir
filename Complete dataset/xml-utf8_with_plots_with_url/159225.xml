<plot>'Drawing Genesis' is a saturated visual compendium which traces C. Graham Asmundson's performative gestures and visual residue. With the use of time lapse, still frames, lens obstruction, occult symbolism, subliminal imagery and blatant queer references; the film presents a ritual of artistic inspiration that invokes man's primal forces. The soundtrack was created by converting a photograph of one of the paintings to a MIDI music file. This was subsequently entered into various synthesizers and sound programs and ultimately performed live by electronic artist, Cake Builder, adding a lush sound sigil to the frenetic magical imagery. This film was created during the One Take Super 8 Event at the first annual WNDX Festival of Avant Garde &amp; Underground Film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?159225</url></doc>
