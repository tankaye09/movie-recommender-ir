<plot>"Young musician Luke comes 'to' on the floor of his room to discover his flatmates have vanished and an ominous message is scrawled across the wall. With no recollection at all of the previous evening's events Luke is left, confused and deserted, with no explanation. Luke's nightmare is however, not about to be over. Alone in his house, he is visited by a menacing character looking for payback, a character not about to go away. Equally persistent with his visits, but much more welcome, is crazy best friend 'Nick' a person fast becoming Luke's sole link to reality. Adding to his anxiety and confusion are the strange and threatening events that are occurring around the neighbourhood ...and just what does the creepy house across the street have to do with all this? As the lines start to blur between what is real and what is not, Luke struggles to solve the mystery of the forgotten night and his missing flatmates..."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197252</url></doc>
