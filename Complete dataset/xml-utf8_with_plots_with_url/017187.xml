<plot>A TICKET TO HOLLYWOOD: EUROPEANS IN SCREENLAND, 1925-56 - PROLOGUE  - Hollywood and Los Angeles history emphasizing human and cultural diversity. It focuses on the contingent of European men and women of arts and letters whose journey to Los Angeles was ostensibly spurred by an interest in the motion picture industry and the opportunities it was believed to generate. It consists of five short chapters covering architecture, music, literature, the movies, and the Europeans in 1930s, 40s and 50s Los Angeles. Though PROLOGUE introduces the diversity of individual experience, the interconnectedness of European immigrant life in L.A. will be stressed by linking each character's narrative together into one continuous story.  Stressing the role of LA in the lives of the immigrants reflects the filmmaker's belief that the city and its distinguished and sometimes overlooked European residents grew together and contributed, albeit unevenly, to each other's growth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?017187</url></doc>
