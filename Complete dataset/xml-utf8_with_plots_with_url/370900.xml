<plot>This picture shows two trains drawn by two of the smallest engines in the world. They are operated universally by Cagney Brothers, and the cars are all filled with people from the time the Exposition is opened in the morning until the last moment in the evening. This picture shows both trains crowded with merry children, and is full of life, and an excellent piece of photography.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?370900</url></doc>
