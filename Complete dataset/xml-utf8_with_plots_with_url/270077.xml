<plot>I was always jealous of my brother. I envy his natural good looks, his easy-going nature, his popularity, his success and now his film star wife. Look at her Hollywood body, her perfect buttocks. Sure it's their wedding day - but I know it's me she wants. A comedy of resentment and desire.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?270077</url></doc>
