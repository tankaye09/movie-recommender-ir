<plot>The story is set in the late 1800's rural countryside during the dead of winter. A little girl lives with her ailing mother and their scruffy dog in a large Gothic style mansion. One day she bundles up, tucks an orange in her pocket and goes for a walk with her dog. During her outing, several things happen that test her ability to endure. This gentle drama reminds us that during hardship, human nature will rise to the occasion and give us the strength that is asked of us.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?658452</url></doc>
