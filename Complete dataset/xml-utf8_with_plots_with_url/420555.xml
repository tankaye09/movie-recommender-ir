<plot>Far from home, a lonely Mexican spray-paint artist spends his time creating art in a French square. Taking little interest in onlooking tourists Javier works in silence until the friendly face of Mary-Anne, a Canadian tourist in a coat as colourful as his paintings, catches his attention. Javier and Mary-Anne struggle to overcome language barriers as they get to know each other over lunch. She soon discovers there is an aspect of his past from which he cannot flee. With only a pin of the French flag to guide him, Javier is following a childhood obsession to find his father. Alarmed by the unrealistic nature of his quest, but smitten by his journey Mary-Anne seeks to protect him.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?420555</url></doc>
