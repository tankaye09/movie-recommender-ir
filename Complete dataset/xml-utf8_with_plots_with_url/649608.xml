<plot>Writer/Director Bruce Kimmel says: I directed a documentary for KABC Channel Seven, called Weekday Heroes, which was about the local kid show hosts who did live shows five days a week here in Los Angeles. It was my affectionate tribute to them, and it was a dream come true for me to meet not only Sheriff John, but Engineer Bill and Chucko the Clown as well. They were all the sweetest people, none more so than the Sheriff.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?649608</url></doc>
