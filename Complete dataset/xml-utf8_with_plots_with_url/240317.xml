<plot>Winter time: Christmas season. It's very cold. A 27 year old guy enters a café. He looks around at the happy young people. He goes to bar area and sits. There is a 35 year old man next to him. He thinks he will be like that man in 5 years time. And then a beautiful girl enters the café. She is his ideal girl. He wants to talk to her but can't. He is shy and thinks if he talks to her, and she rejects him, the guy next to him will laugh. He tries to be brave, but it is so hard to do.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?240317</url></doc>
