<plot>Eddie Johnson is down in the dumps. He's been in a hobby club for three years, wanted to be elected treasurer, and isn't even nominated. He complains to his dad, who walks him through various small ways in which someone shows his or her trustworthiness in order to be trusted with big things. Dad talks about keeping trust at home, at school, with friends and with groups. Eddie starts to catch on, realizing that his friend Bob was elected club treasurer after showing his trustworthiness in many small ways. So Eddie resolves to play fair, keep his work, do a good job, and be on time. Soon new responsibilities come his way.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?033376</url></doc>
