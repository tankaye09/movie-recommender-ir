<plot>A young man and woman's isolated life is interrupted when a child burrows her way into the back room of their dilapidated shack. Like the wail of a banshee, she begins to play a haunting song to them on her violin, warning them of death. Unable to get into the mysterious room, they become increasingly perplexed and frustrated by her presence. When the woman begins to become unaffected by the forces of gravity, he must decide to heed the banshee's call and say goodbye to his lover.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?344080</url></doc>
