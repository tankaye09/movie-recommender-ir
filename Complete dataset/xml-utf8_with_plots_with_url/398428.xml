<plot>So many of us depend on 24 hour news channels for all the information we need to get on with our lives... Just consider for a moment... What if you lost this "connection"?! What if there was NO way to find out what was happening in the world beyond your own front door?! Ok... Most of what is broadcast on these channels is worthless "time-filler" so they can justify being on the air for 24 hours. We all know that... But, what if something happened? And you KNEW something happened? Something that changed your own life in a way that allowed you to begin to consider all of the ramifications without any influence from those who influence you every day of your life? What would you think?... This is what happened to Phil &amp; Kim Anderson! A couple who narrowly escaped NYC after the events of September 11, 2001... They moved WAY out to the deep woods of Pennsylvania... They set themselves up with everything they thought they needed... Including a satellite dish to bring them all the news they thought they needed. One day... They lost their "connection"... And then... FOUND IT!</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?398428</url></doc>
