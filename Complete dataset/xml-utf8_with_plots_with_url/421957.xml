<plot>This is a magnificent view of one of the icy monsters of the North. Swinging from left to right, there is unfolded to the astonished eye of those unfamiliar with these sights a mammouth mountain wall of white, shimmering ice, a mile and a half wide, and from one hundred to three hundred feet high. With its columns and domes, spires and minarets reflecting the sun's iridescent glow, it is a thing of imposing beauty. Then as you hear the rumbling thunderous sound like cannonading, the glacier takes on animal forms, and as our camera reaches the very center of the monster, you see it hurl from itself a hundred thousand large and small whirling, rolling, writhing white objects that crash into the green water, and churn it to a creamy mass. An altogether unique subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?421957</url></doc>
