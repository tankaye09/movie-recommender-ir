<plot>Shows six young ladies in a dormitory. One goes to a table and procures five plates. The bottoms are smeared with soot, which is not known to the participants in the game. The leader's own plate is clean. The leader then rubs her finger on the bottom of the plate and touches it to her nose, cheek, chin and forehead. The six girls then look at their faces in a mirror. They get even with her by rubbing her face completely with the black soot from the bottom of the plates. Very amusing.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?199000</url></doc>
