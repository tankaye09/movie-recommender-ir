<plot>Jason Goldframe is a god in Hollywood. He makes movies, he's demanding, he wants to be first, there are at least five phones on his desk. At the end of a day in which he has been driving his staff to finish a picture in 270 millimeters (another first, if he can pull it off), he visits a sound stage and directs a lighting technician to project a bright light on his back so he can cast a large shadow on a white wall. Goldframe then sets about with great energy and manic action to move faster than his shadow: 'I must be first.' Has he met his match in his two-dimensional doppelganger?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?219139</url></doc>
