<plot>New York documentary filmmaker Bill Hussung takes an offbeat look at family values when he decides to investigate his own mother's encounter with a giant UFO 15 years ago. The filmmaker's journey begins shortly after his mother's cancer diagnosis and takes viewers deep into the heart and soul of upstate New York folklore as well as his own family's mythology. Mr. Hussung journey's across the Hudson Valley with his cinematographer wife Mishara Canino-Hussung in search of something both in the sky and in his own heart. What he finds comes as a surprise and is sure to keep viewers guessing about the true meaning of the mysterious lights in the night sky above Pine Bush, New York.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?197863</url></doc>
