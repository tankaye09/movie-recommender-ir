<plot>A coming of age tale of three lifelong friends on their yearly road trip. Steve, Joshua and April are on what seems to be another typical trip together, however this year tension is high and riffs between the three are beginning to emerge. The play between fear of change and the bond between friends evokes a subtle sadness that resonates throughout the quirky and mundane moments of the trip. As their lives head in different directions the three friends are faced with the difficult feelings that come with growing up and moving on.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?654098</url></doc>
