<plot>Part IV. Scorched and battered by an alien atmosphere, the surviving ships of the Empirion Expedition finally reach a distant uncharted planet on which they hope to make their own. The plant appears desolate but a survey shows primitive life. The commander immediately orders they be wiped out under secret colonisation protocols but most crew are unaware of these protocols and refuse to follow orders. When the commander tries to have them expelled, mutiny breaks out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?176862</url></doc>
