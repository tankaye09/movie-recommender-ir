Their life suddenly gets a new perspective when they observe a robbed armored car is parked downstairs by three black hardened criminals. Jack only has eyes for the mountain of cash that can turn them instantly super-rich, and produces -to his startled brother's surprise- a hand gun, just in case; Moe on the other hand is reticent, till they notice a blonde girl which the hoods hold handcuffed, then decides rescuing her is worth the risk. After the three thugs have a row, Trent, who is unruly even by their standards, takes off but returns with a few scared white buddies of his. There are now too many guns and takers for the money for the plot to end without a heavy body count, while happy ends seem unlikely...</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?564114</url></doc>
