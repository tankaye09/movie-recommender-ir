<plot>A young woman of uninhibited sexuality struggles against the oppressive standards imposed by her malicious mother, the sinister Madame Dumont. Her dilemma is underscored by the institutionalization of her father, who she admires for his creativity, but whom, although harmless, has been placed into a sanatorium for his inability to exist in a rational world. The young painter, Perinne, defends her father to her dogmatic mother, only to provoke further interrogation and rejection. She plummets into despair and seeks refuge in the underbelly of the nightlife, and in her friend Daniel, a gentle young painting student. In the course of her adventures, she meets Arthur, a poet and transsexual performance artist who fled his homeland on a ship. Arthur lives freely as the person he wants to be, beyond the reproach of anyone. Perinne envies and admires the lifestyle he reveals to her, and the two become lovers. Love, however, is unrequited, and while her friend Daniel would willingly spend his life with her, Perinne longs for the excitement and freedom Arthur represents, although ultimately his desire for worldly success makes their relationship untenable. Perinne slowly unravels, confounded by the dichotomy of love and passion, and struggles to reconcile her affection for Daniel with her intense need for Arthur's devotion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?149986</url></doc>
