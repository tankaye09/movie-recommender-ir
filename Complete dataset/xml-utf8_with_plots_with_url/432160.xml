<plot>A black man and a white man are seen eating blackberry pie on a wager. The judge stands over them and whenever they raise their heads, he plunges them back into the pies. The white man's face is funny to look at as he besmears himself with blackberries. A good brilliant subject.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?432160</url></doc>
