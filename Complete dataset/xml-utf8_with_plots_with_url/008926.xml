<plot>The daughter and sweetheart are in love, but their affairs move anything but smoothly, because the father has other ideas for his daughter's marriage. He has already selected the Count as a future son-in-law, but the daughter has a nasty temper of her own, and refuses point blank. The father has never seen the Count and finds an Irishman in the park whom he mistakes for the Count and invites to dinner. Amazing complications result when the real Count arrives.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?008926</url></doc>
