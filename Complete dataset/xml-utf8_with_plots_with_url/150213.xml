<plot>A kind-hearted, widowed landlord, Thakur, lives a wealthy lifestyle with his son, Ramesh; daughter, Roopa; and an adopted child, Shankar. Ramesh hates Shankar and often abuses him. Years pass by, Thakur has passed away, and all three children have grown up. While Ramesh visits a stunningly attractive Courtesan, Tara, drinks alcohol, and continues to abuse and mercilessly beat Shankar, who bears this in silence as he and Roopa are in love with each other. When Ramesh finds out that Roopa wants to wed Shankar, he has him severely beaten and thrown off a cliff. He then arranges Roopa's marriage with another wealthy man, Satish, while he continues to romance Tara and even signs over his entire estate and home to her name. Then a few years later, Shankar returns - this time as the wealthy Raja of Belapur - and he all set to compromise with Ramesh and propose to Roopa. He finds out that nothing has changed, Ramesh, though rendered penniless by Tara, still hates him; and Satish is wooing Roopa, is engaged to her and a marriage date has been fixed. Shankar's love is now replaced by vengeance and hate, and all he can think of is destroying the lives of Ramesh, Roopa, Satish and his sister, Mala, and he has several plans which he intends to put to use one by one.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?150213</url></doc>
