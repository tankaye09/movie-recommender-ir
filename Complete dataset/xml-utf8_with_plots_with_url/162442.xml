<plot>Bitter enmity has always existed between the Oberoi and the Singh families. With each and every generation swearing to extract vengeance. This generation consists of Suraj Singh and his brother, Jai. While Jai leads the life of a gangster, Suraj is not inclined to violence at all. He meets with a young woman named Sapna, and both fall in love with each other. When he takes Sapna to be introduced to Jai and the rest of his family, he is told that he cannot marry Sapna, as she is the daughter of Oberoi. Sapna and Suraj are able to convince Jai and the rest of the Singh family to give up this enmity, and let them marry. Jai goes to meet Oberoi, and proposes marriage, and to his joy, Oberoi agrees, and both families start preparations for the marriage. Jai starts to relax and thinks about giving up his gangster-like life. It is then a group of men target him with automatic weapons, leaving him mortally wounded and hospitalized. When Suraj finds out, he is enraged, and decides to avenge his brother's injuries. He finds out that the assailants are none other than Oberoi's men, and he swears to bring an end to Oberoi and all of his family, including Sapna. And thus begins the vengeance of this generation.....</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?162442</url></doc>
