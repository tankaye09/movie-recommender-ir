<plot>Laxmi (Moushumi Chatterjee) was a heart-breaker during her college days, and one of her jilted suitors was Dinesh Khanna (Danny Denzongpa), who never quite got over her rejecting him, not even when Laxmi married singer Vijay Kumar(Jeetendra) and gave birth to a son, Raja (Master Bunty). When his attempts to lure Vijay Kumar abroad fail, Dinesh ends up killing him, seriously crippling his best friend, Tom Dacosta (Vinod Mehra), and then setting-up Laxmi as the killer, and getting her sentenced to 14 years in prison. Years later, Raja (Govinda)has grown up and Laxmi has been discharged from prison. Raja follows in his dad's footsteps, and meets with Renu (Shilpa Shirodkar), both eventually fall in love. Renu is introduced to Laxmi, who approves of her instantly. Then Laxmi comes to know that Renu is really Dinesh's daughter, and he may be using her to get close to Laxmi again.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?441751</url></doc>
