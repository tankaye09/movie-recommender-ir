<plot>The film starts as a World War II veteran recalls a threesome with another soldier and a grateful French rescued Nurse Willow. Years later in a hospital, he is nonchalant when a nurse casually does sexual acts with his privates. His soldier friend though is only too happy to join her from behind. A soldier in the next room allows Nurse Grimbal to cure his impotence. In a third room, Nurse Dawn offers the same cure to a mute soldier. She too is joined from behind by the first soldier, who continues on to join Nurse Shield in a fourth room. Meanwhile, General Wastemail, who owns the hospital, has a son Gilford who plans a takeover by paying the nurses to outwear his incompetent old father with sex. When Nurse Shield fails the task, Nurse Grimbal joins in. Head nurse Brook joins both. Nurse Dawn offers her backside. Alas, the old man not only stands tall, but regains his health out of the experience.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?408225</url></doc>
