<plot>This cautionary tale, based on a real-life incident, was aimed to depict the dangers of teen-aged joy riding. Val and Tim are two bored teen-aged boys who decide they need a car to pick up girls. As they scoff at an older teen-ager named Randy, the two boys make good on their plan to steal his car (Randy had left the keys in the ignition). Val and Tim invite two female friends named Kari and Vicki along on their joy ride to a wooded area just outside of town. The foursome lose track of time and realize they need to get the car back before Randy has it reported stolen. An unlicensed Val speeds and drives recklessly, and is quickly pursued by a highway patrolman. Ignoring his passengers' pleas to pull over (or at least slow down), Val loses control of the car and - in a struggle between Val and Kari - collides head-on with side of a cliff. The post-script reveals the grim aftermath: Val, Tim and Kari are killed in the crash, and Vicki is rendered paralyzed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?280090</url></doc>
