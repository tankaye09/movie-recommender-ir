<plot>WHERE IS WHERE? is based on an incident which took place during the Algerian independence war in 1950's. Reacting to the acts of violence committed by the French, two young Algerian boys murder their friend, a French boy. The story, told in multiple simultaneous images, starts in the present day as Death enters the house of the Poet. She starts to investigate these past events, which gradually become interwoven with the present moment. A mist clears from the back garden of the Poet's house to reveal a small row-boat which has appeared in the swimming pool. In it sit Adel and Ismael.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?653784</url></doc>
