<plot>Emily us getting old, but once again she takes the long trip up into the mountains to see her loved one Henry. We first just see her as she climbs the mountains. To us it seems like she is there by herself, she makes a final stop at a stone table at an opening in the woods, and takes out her things from her backpack. One object is a picture of her and her loved one Henry, another things is a box with a chess game in it. She sets up the game as it was started off some other time. She plays the games as someone is there with her. Finally she gets up and in front of her we see a big tree with something that looks like a man integrated to the tree, its her love Henry. She sits down by him and rests while Henry Finishes the game. The dialog is important in the story, but what the end really is, is left up to the audience to decide.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?187963</url></doc>
