<plot>A financier lives in his life in the same manner in which he runs his business: with an iron hand and with the belief that anything wanted badly enough can be purchased. He sets his eyes on a beautiful young woman and wins her by paying her father's debts. But his dictatorial treatment leads her to hate him and run away. He learns finally that if his life is to be happy, he must find a new way to live it.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?548208</url></doc>
