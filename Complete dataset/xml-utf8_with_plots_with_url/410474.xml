<plot>Canadian aviation history makes for fascinating viewing in this international award winning, nine part documentary. On Canadian Wings begins with Canada's first foray into the world of flight with experiments in aeronautics and acts of pilot bravery that set the stage for Canada's future excellence in military aviation. The video recounts the importance Canadian pilots played in the air battles of the First and Second World Wars, particularly Canada's extraordinary successes in the Battle of Britain. It also takes a look at Canadian air power in the Korean conflict and explores the technological superiority of Canada's world class Avro Arrow supersonic jet. Finally we learn about Canada's involvement, through the UN, in modern conflicts like the Balkans and Central America.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?410474</url></doc>
