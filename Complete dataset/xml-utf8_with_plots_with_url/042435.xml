<plot>Jim is a notoriously anti-social suburban teenager. When he ventures out on a lone walk down to a local creek, Jim drops his watch in the filth-ridden water. After arachnophobia prevents him from retrieving his watch, Jim finds himself reluctantly and awkwardly interacting with another person to get it back. At home, Jim prepares for a couple hours alone with his parents out of the house- closing the window shades and heating up some microwaveable soup. After some mysterious phone calls from seemingly malicious strangers, Jim has a fear-induced panic attack and begins to drift away from reality. When Jim lets loose his fear, he severs all connection with the outside world and secures his own unfortunate fate.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?042435</url></doc>
