<plot>This film will appeal to the sons and daughters of the Emerald Isle where the great Daniel O'Connell first saw the light of day. You rarely see a real Irish reel and you stamp your foot to the time of the music, which should be played when this film is on the screen and many of your audience if allowed would willingly take part. Biddy Murphy and Mickey Roach have an exciting finish. There are quite a number of persons in this dance. Full of motion.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?268489</url></doc>
