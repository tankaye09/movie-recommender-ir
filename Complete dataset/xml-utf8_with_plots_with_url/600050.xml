<plot>Follows one of the first water battles playing out in the United States from an environmental justice perspective. Residents of Highland Park, known as the birthplace of the auto-industry, have received high water bills, they have had their water turned off, their homes foreclosed, and are in the midst of a fight to keep their water from becoming privatized. The Water Front follows one woman's struggle to organize a grassroots campaign to keep her home and defend affordable water as a basic human right. The film is an unnerving indication of what is in store for cities around the world facing an impending global water crisis.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?600050</url></doc>
