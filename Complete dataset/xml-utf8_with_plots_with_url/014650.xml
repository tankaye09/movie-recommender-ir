<plot>A PLACE TO LIVE chronicles the journey of seven brave individuals as they attempt to secure a home in Triangle Square, Hollywood, the nation's first affordable housing facility for LGBT seniors. Since demand far exceeds the number of available apartments, a lottery system was set up to determine who would be selected. This film is a moving exploration of the applicants' personal stories and the journey that brought them to the lottery and what the future might hold.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?014650</url></doc>
