<plot>Thomas is a young boy who lives with his mother. When they move to a tenant-owner flat, they soon meet the janitor, who is over-protective about the lawn. The janitor has placed cameras all over the area, to prevent that people step on the lawn. He gives the impression that he is the perfect janitor, but eventually Thomas discovers a dark secret about him. He has stolen from all the people who lives in the flats. His goal had been to be the janitor of the year but this did not happen at all.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?436140</url></doc>
