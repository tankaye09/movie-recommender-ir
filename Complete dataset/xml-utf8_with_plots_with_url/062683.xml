<plot>Beaver Falls Pennsylvania was a city built of steel and built on the legend of one Joe Namath. But just as the steel industry went, so did the fond memories of Joe Namath. Decades after his march on to Super Bowl wins and worldwide fame, the City of Beaver Falls has done nothing to honor him. This isn't the only opportunity missed as shown in this pointed look at the city of Beaver Falls and its most recognizable figure. Why isn't Namth honored? Is there a good reason? Will the city of Beaver Falls ever make it back to it's heyday when Namath was throwing TD's at the local high school? These questions and more are answered in Dan Woodske's debut film.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?062683</url></doc>
