<plot>The story follows Leo Caraway, who has his Harvard scholarship taken away when unjustly accused of cheating on a test. He discovers that his true biological father is Marion X. McMurphy, the lead singer of an 80's punk band, Purge. The band just so happens to be on a revival tour, and, hoping to get the money from his real dad to pay for Harvard, Leo joins as a roadie. They develop a strong father-son relationship throughout the road trip, during which Leo is plunged into the gritty subculture of punk.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?080012</url></doc>
