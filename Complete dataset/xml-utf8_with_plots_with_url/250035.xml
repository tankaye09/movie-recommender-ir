<plot>Priya, Anjali, and Jojo are three young ladies who have just been admitted in a girls' hostel. They are to share their room with each other as well as a fourth lady named Kiran. To their surprise, Kiran turns out to be a boy. Starry eyed Anjali had been to a fortune-teller, who had foretold that she will meet a young man by the name of Amar, while in this hostel. Jojo and Priya have their own dream-men. Only time will tell if their sweethearts really do come forth.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?250035</url></doc>
