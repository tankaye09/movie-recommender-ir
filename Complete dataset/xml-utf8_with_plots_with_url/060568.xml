<plot>A sports documentary recap of the just-concluded 1953-1954 collegiate basketball season with game film from the National Invitational Tournament in NYC and the NCAA championship tournament in Kansas City. In this period,long before "March Madness", "The Elite Eight" and "The Final Four", the NIT was the most coveted title and press-covered of the season-ending tournaments. (Small disclaimer: "Press" is the correct word. The word 'media' existed but wasn't used then as it is now.)Tournament games shown featured BYU vs. St. Francis of Pa., Western Kentucky vs. Bowling Green, Niagara vs. Dayton, Niagara vs. Western Kentucky (which means the fans of those schools can rightfully conclude that Western Kentucky beat Bowling Green and Niagara beat Dayton and they are still alive for the brackets charters), and Holy Cross vs. Duquense and LaSalle vs. Bradley, among others. Much footage also given over to seeing the Harlem Globetrotters make mince-meat out of the (suspect) Collegiate All-Americans.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?060568</url></doc>
