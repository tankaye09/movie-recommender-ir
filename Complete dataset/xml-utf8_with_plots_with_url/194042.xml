<plot>A man obsessed with symmetry begins an obsessive quest to draw a perfectly balanced Figure 8. As the days roll by and the world seems to move along without him he becomes more and more determined to accomplish this possibly impossible task. As he does, his mind begins playing tricks on him and he ends up in competition with himself. Two sides of a whole. Coming to an ingenious solution, but eventually turning against each other - two sides of the same person can not exist in conflict.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?194042</url></doc>
