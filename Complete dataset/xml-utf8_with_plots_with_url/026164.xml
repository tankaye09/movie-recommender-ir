<plot>A rough-spoken supervisor of a team of lumbermen, Vlasis, is having an affair with a poor girl, Fani, whom he avoids marrying. She gets angry and seeks comfort in the plain with rice-fields, at the hut of a working woman, Rinio, who is harassed by her boss, Thomas. An encounter between the two men will bring to the surface a preexisting hatred, and their conflict will result in Thomas' murder. Rinio, however, is presumed guilty, since she had previously injured Thomas trying to defend herself from his attacks. In an effort to leave the area, she meets Petros, a nice lumberman who takes care of her, offering food and a place to stay, but once again she falls into the hands of Vlasis, who, using force, tries to keep her close to him. Petros fights with the supervisor, and Fani reveals everything, compelling Vlasis to flee, pursued by the police and, in the end, get killed.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?026164</url></doc>
