Alex and Brenda develop a special relationship during the time they go on a business trip together. However, when Brenda gets back, she finds out that Brian has met someone else. Brenda and Alex get closer and more intimate as a result and they sleep with each other. Her co-workers and parents, not to mention Brian's sister &amp; family are shocked to hear Brian, a young 27 year old guy going out with someone much older than him. Unfortunately, when Brenda and Alex are at a party together, Brenda gets a little angry when Alex keeps on insisting to let people know he's Brenda's secretary. They fight and break up as a result. Her friends hook her up with another doctor guy who asks her to marry him. They throw an engagement party, and it is at this party that Brenda realizes that she only loves Alex.
