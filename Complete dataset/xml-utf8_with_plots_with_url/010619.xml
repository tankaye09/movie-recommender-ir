<plot>This film was taken at the Sedan Manoeuvres by special permission of the Minister of War. It offers to the eye of the spectator a full view of the exercises of a French Cycling Company, the first which has been introduced into European Armies. At the commencement of the exhibition the troop of cyclists is seen to arrive, and upon the sign of the commander suddenly halts. The men descend from their machines, which they take apart, and place on their backs, and after a series of exercises they disappear in the mountain which dominates the field of manoeuvres.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?010619</url></doc>
