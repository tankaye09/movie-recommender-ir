<plot>Ethel and Marge recline in lounge chairs at the Atlantic City shore. As they look out toward the water, they comment on their vacation thus far, Ethel's date last night, and their dim prospects for fun. Marge is mostly the straight man to Ethel's salty and brassy observations. At the end of the reel, they're joined by a male bather who chats them up in hopes of a date for a wild party that evening. Will either gal give him the time of day? Will he escape with his dignity?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?049766</url></doc>
