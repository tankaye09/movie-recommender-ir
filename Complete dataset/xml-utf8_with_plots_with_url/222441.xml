<plot>This picture is a perfect representation of the greatest waterfall in all Europe. A small row boat passes through the rapids approaching the falls. One large rock divides the river, and the water rushing on each side of it makes the falls as large as they are. A little way up the rapids is a railroad bridge which crosses the river Rhein, and to add interest to the picture a train is seen crossing the bridge at full speed. A very interesting subject taken in a beautiful country.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?222441</url></doc>
