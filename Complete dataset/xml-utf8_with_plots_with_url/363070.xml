<plot>Actor, performer, and multi-platinum rock icon Meat Loaf reveals surprising shades of himself - and a fertile creative mind in constant flux - in this intimate and highly-entertaining theatrical feature documentary. The time is early 2007, one of the most stressful in Meat Loaf's career, when he is about to launch his most ambitious tour ever: an 18 month long marathon to support Bat Out of Hell III, the final album of the legendary "Bat" trilogy (first two albums had combined sales of over 55 million- two of the biggest selling albums of all time). His exhausting - and often poignant - journey takes him from Burbank, California through the first leg of his tour through Canada. Along the way, an unexpected media controversy erupts over the staging of one of his songs - a controversy that raises questions about his art, his age, his relevance - and brings into focus the drive (and demons) that have fueled his over-the-top stage persona for almost 40 years. MEAT LOAF: IN SEARCH OF PARADISE is a portrait of an extraordinary, international icon that includes performances of his biggest hits like "I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won?t Do That)", "Took the Words", "Two Out of Three", and of course "Paradise by the Dashboard Light." Shot on tour and on location in eight Canadian cities, from Victoria to Toronto.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?363070</url></doc>
