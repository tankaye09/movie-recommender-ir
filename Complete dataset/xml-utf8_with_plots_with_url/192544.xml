<plot>David Fennario invited friends and family to his Verdun (Montreal) apartment where he read his newest play, an account in which he takes on the character of the past speaking directly to the present, speaking with power and truth, a dramatic monologue which picks up on the author's lifelong concern with "the war to end all wars." Fennario plays three characters: the young journalist Jerry Nines, the aging veteran Harry "Rosie" Rollins, and his best friend Private Rummie Robidou. The setting is the "King Eddy", a hotel bar in Montreal, Remembrance Day 1977, as Rollins tells Nines about the experience of being in the trenches during World War One.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?192544</url></doc>
