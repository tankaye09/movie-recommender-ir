<plot>Police Inspector Shekhar Varma lives in Khar, Bombay, along with his wife, Meena, and a school-going daughter. His office is notified that Editor Ritesh Nandy has received death threats as he come across evidence that would expose some very influential people. Ritesh is assigned police protection, however, he gets killed. A stunningly beautiful woman, Geeta Sarabhai, comes forward as a witness to Ritesh's death, but is unable to identify the assailant. When she starts receiving death threats Shekhar and Inspector Pramod Kadam take turns to protect her. Shekhar and Geeta fall in love with each other, and Meena starts to suspect that Shekhar is having an affair. She gets him to admit this, and moves out to live with her dad. Then Pramod is grievously wounded while trying to protect Geeta and is hospitalized. Shekhar will soon find out that Ritesh's killing is closely linked to high-ranked police officials - and he will also find out that that no matter what he does, he will, leave alone Geeta, be unable to protect himself, Meena and his daughter.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?282043</url></doc>
