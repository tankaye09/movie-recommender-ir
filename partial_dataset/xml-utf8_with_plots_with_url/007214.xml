<plot>A dependent man, that has one girlfriend too many, fakes his own mental illness to inherit the fortune of his two brothers, who have troubles of their own. The eldest brother is a busy businessman who is planning to open a restaurant. Due to his busy schedule, he is putting his relationship on the line with his wife. The second brother is a scholar who brings home a finance-troubled girl to arouse hatred in his father (in return with some money) so the brother can choose to marry his punkish girlfriend, whom his father detests. However, the girl has fallen in love with the brother.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007214</url></doc>
