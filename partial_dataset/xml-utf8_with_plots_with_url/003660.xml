<plot>This documentary tells what happened on December 20th 2001, a date that marked a turning point in Argentine democracy. The facts precipitated vertiginously that day, and the people decided something had to change. It all started with the banging of saucepans and spontaneous marches and ended with blood. "December 20th" tells about what happened those days, who were on the streets, why they left their homes, how the repression got started and why and who murdered the people that were killed. The documentary is crossed by three plot lines: The previous atmosphere, the critical 24 hours and the consequences.</plot><plot>This documentary tells what happened on December 20th 2001, a date that marked a turning point in Argentine democracy.
