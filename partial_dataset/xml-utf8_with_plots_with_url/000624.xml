<plot>A gardener is sprinkling a lawn. "Weary Willie" appears upon the scene. He seizes the hose and doubles it up so that the flow of water is checked. The gardener thinking there is something wrong examines the nozzle of the hose while "Weary Willie" releases the kink in the hose and the water gushes into the gardener's face, knocking him violently to the ground. The gardener starts after "Weary Willie," playing the hose on him as he runs. The tramp is finally captured by a policeman and marched off to the station, dripping wet. Very humorous.</plot><plot>A gardener is sprinkling a lawn. "Weary Willie" appears upon the scene. He seizes the hose and doubles it up so that the flow of water is checked.
