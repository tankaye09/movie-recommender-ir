<plot>Here we present a most remarkable view of the plucky challenger Shamrock and the defender Columbia. The yachts both pass and re-pass our camera in jockeying for the start, and we present a very close view and a most perfect photograph. The yachts finally make the start upon the firing of a gun and cross the line so close to our camera that we could have "tossed a biscuit" on the decks of either boat.</plot><plot>Here we present a most remarkable view of the plucky challenger Shamrock and the defender Columbia.
