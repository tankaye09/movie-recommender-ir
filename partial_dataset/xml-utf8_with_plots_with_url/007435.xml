<plot>A novice witch is fed up with her slobby roommate and wants him to leave. She decides to place a spell on him, but she needs one more ingredient for the spell to work. She enlists the help of a friend who's all-too-familiar with drugs. She drugs her roommate and performs the spell and is surprised when he stops breathing! A cop neighbor comes to the door and is knocked out with a baseball bat when he sees trouble. But in the end the fledgling witch and her friend are killed. So what happens to the roommate? Watch it to find out.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007435</url></doc>
