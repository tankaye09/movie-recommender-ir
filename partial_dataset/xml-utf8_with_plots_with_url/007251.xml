<plot>In the summer of 2005 the doctors said they were 99% sure filmmaker Phoebe Brown did not have ovarian cancer. She turned out to be the 1%. Two years later Phoebe is cancer free but not without scars. In 99 to 1: Ovarian Cancer and Me, the filmmaker takes us on a journey. Through her diagnosis, her grandmother's death from ovarian cancer, her physical and emotional reactions to chemotherapy treatment and her hopes for the future. A powerful narrative of hope and bringing awareness to the often-overlooked issues of ovarian cancer.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007251</url></doc>
