<plot>Miles McManus is an attention deprived schizophrenic. Ted Garcia is an old rival who wakes up with a bleeding head in Miles' bathtub all tied up, only to realize the reason he is there is his alleged rape of a girl, Annabelle James, crucial to the next day that will change both their lives forever. Never sure of his actions, Miles decides to let Ted speak. Ted swears that this hideous act has never happened, and that he and Annabelle are actually seeing each other. As the grisly night continues, Miles remembers that it was Annabelle's stepfather Jonathan Rivers who had hired him, and Ted's version of the story may actually come through. Little by little both men discover the underlying motive: Money. Annabelle's mother had left a fortune to her and she is the only way that Rivers can ever get close to it. Complications further arise, and Rivers plans on getting Ted's blood along with Annabelle's on his conscience all in the name of wealth. Now Miles is forced to make a decision that could ultimately bring more harm than good to himself. The freedom of one person comes at the cost of another, and Miles is soon confronted by the kidnapping of Annabelle, which will naturally turn into murder once all the money has been transferred. Having been played for a fool, Miles vows to make things right, but soon finds that doing the right thing sometimes translates into all the right things going wrong.</plot><plot>Miles McManus is an attention deprived schizophrenic.
