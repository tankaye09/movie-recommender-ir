<plot>Every year, more than 50,000 people worldwide fall victim to the Nigerian Scam. Usually contacted by e-mail about a business proposal or winning a lottery, the victims lose their life savings after they are persuaded by stories with very tempting outcomes. According to some reports, the scam is the third most lucrative industry in Nigeria, generating over 5 billion dollars in the last 20 years. Authorities have named the scam after the number of the article in the Nigerian constitution that deals with the matter - 419. For the last few months, a filmmaking team from Canada produced this movie, showing how the e-mail scam works.</plot><plot>Every year, more than 50,000 people worldwide fall victim to the Nigerian Scam.
