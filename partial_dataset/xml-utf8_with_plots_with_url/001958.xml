<plot>This picture will not alone enthuse Pennsylvanians, but will receive unbounded applause from any audience, no matter where it is shown, owing to the reputation this brave regiment made for itself in the Philippines. They one and all look every bit the soldier. The late Col. Hawkins, who was in command of the regiment, was a brave and valiant soldier, and his men deserve all the attention that is being showered on them by their countrymen since their return to the United States. This is by far the most accurate drilling scene in Life Motion Pictures ever made.</plot><plot>This picture will not alone enthuse Pennsylvanians, but will receive unbounded applause from any audience, no matter where it is shown, owing to the reputation this brave regiment made for itself in the Philippines.
