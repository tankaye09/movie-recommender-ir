<plot>KST and SOAPnet are producing a season of, "1 Day With...". "1 Day With..." is an un-scripted, reality-based celebrity profile of a daytime actor for one day. The show provides the audience with their first opportunity to witness real moments with their favorite actors who reveal their personal life off the set. Popular daytime actor, Wally Kurth ("Ned" on General Hospital) is the show's host. Wally has a fresh and disarming way of interacting and communicating with his fellow actors. He brings a playful and endearing quality to the show as we watch him and the guest actor/actress share the day together. Each episode features the two stars in a day that is unique to each guest. Wally will look inside their home, learn about their family, explore their passions and find out about other aspirations they may have outside their acting career. It's a candid, spontaneous and often surprising look into the lives of daytime soap actors.</plot><plot>KST and SOAPnet are producing a season of, "1 Day With...".
