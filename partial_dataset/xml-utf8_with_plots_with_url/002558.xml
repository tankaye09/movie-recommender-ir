<plot>The sound of a ticking kitchen timer introduces a slim, nude woman who is standing in semi-profile against a bare, off-white wall. Her expression is impassive. Her image flickers slightly, and we watch her abdomen grow, realizing we are seeing a time-lapse sequence of her pregnancy. After 17 seconds, the timer rings; a baby appears in her arms, and the time-lapse gives way to real time. A mother's beatific smile appears as she cuddles the child.</plot><plot>The sound of a ticking kitchen timer introduces a slim, nude woman who is standing in semi-profile against a bare, off-white wall.
