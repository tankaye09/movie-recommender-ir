<plot>Korea, 1724. Once upon a time in the Choson Dynasty, Chun-doong falls in love at first sight with a beautiful woman whilst in the middle of a fight. Her name is Seol-ji and she works as a kisaeng, a high-class courtesan. When she is delivered by accident to Chun-doong's tavern to work as a maid, he is the happiest man in the land until she is snatched away by her rightful owner, Man-deuk. He vows to get her back, but alone he is no match for Man-deuk, a fierce gang boss with political connections. While still despondent without Seol-ji in his life, he is challenged to a friendly fight by Man-deuk's main rival, gang boss Jjak-gwi. When he accidentally knocks him into a coma, he is hired as the replacement boss. Jjak-gwi was en route to a gathering of the nation's gang bosses at Man-deuk's inn where Seol-ji now works. During the assembly, Man-deuk almost initiates a war in the underworld when he brings Seol-ji into the negotiations. But Man-deuk has his own reasons to plot the downfall of the Jjak-gwi gang, including larger ambitions to betray the king and seize ultimate power.</plot><plot>Korea, 1724.
