<plot>Explores the profound effect that his father's blindness had on Rembrandt and the way this influenced his work. "R" deals with the shock of 'dissatributation', a correspondance through Ben Israel between Rembrandt and Milton, and the transcendental quality of light both in Rembrandt's technique and the subject of many of his paintings. It also emphasises the powerful emotions transmitted through his work.</plot><plot>Explores the profound effect that his father's blindness had on Rembrandt and the way this influenced his work.
