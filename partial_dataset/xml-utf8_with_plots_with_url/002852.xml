<plot>A group of 19 young women, led by a partizan man, are the only people available to escort a number of partisan wounded in the struggle for freedom, in the mountain ranges invaded by the Nazi army. The crossing of difficult tracks, and a few encounters with enemy patrols provide danger, and death for some heroines. Two girls are in love with the column's commander, but love for the motherland and freedom will prove stronger.</plot><plot>A group of 19 young women, led by a partizan man, are the only people available to escort a number of partisan wounded in the struggle for freedom, in the mountain ranges invaded by the Nazi army.
