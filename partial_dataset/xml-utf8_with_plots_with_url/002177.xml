<plot>A politician, giving a speech, has 120 seconds to convince the crowd to vote for him. Making quick calculations based on their cheers and jeers, he moves away from promising jobs (that will result in money and happiness, but that take work) to promises to lower taxes, send the poor to work camps, and raise money for the army. His final platform: "Do you want to be rich now? Vote for me." The crowd goes wild.</plot><plot>A politician, giving a speech, has 120 seconds to convince the crowd to vote for him.
