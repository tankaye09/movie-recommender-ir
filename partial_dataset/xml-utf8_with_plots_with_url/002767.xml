<plot>Everything is going great for the Director: he inherited the benefits of two generations of New York Jews who turned their backs on their religious past and re-invented themselves in America. But when his ex-pat Israeli hustler pal Shimon walks into the trendy L.A. Kabbalah Center and walks out newly-religious - with a one-way ticket to a yeshiva in Jerusalem in hand - the Director's world is turned upside down. Following Shimon to Israel, the Director moves through Israel's religious and spiritual communities investigating and wondering whether everyone, not just Madonna and Shimon, has lost his mind.</plot><plot>Everything is going great for the Director: he inherited the benefits of two generations of New York Jews who turned their backs on their religious past and re-invented themselves in America.
