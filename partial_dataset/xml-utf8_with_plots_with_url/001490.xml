<plot>MAGOG is one of one-third of fallen angels relegated to the center of the Earth. For thousands of years he has wreaked havoc amongst the generations of men. His task is simple: Every 300 years MAGOG is assigned to garner the souls of the "Seeds of Promise"-the chosen of men and women born to accomplish great exploits in the Earth before they can reach their predestination. The culmination of his task leaves behind the carnage of dead, mutilated and desecrated bodies-ultimately lost souls banished to HELL having never fulfilled the true intent of their existence. What's more, MAGOG leaves behind his own "Seed" to further advance HELL's design in the Earth. MAGOG's "Special" way of capturing the Earth's chosen is through THE DOORS of their own frailties, insecurities and indecencies. These DOORS have proven to be the unforgiving and inescapable paths to the horrors of HELL-one's personal and individual hell. In thousands of years no fallible human being have been able to escape MAGOG's sensuous and diabolical scheme, except one: A 18th Century French nobleman who outwitted the ancient demon, lived to tell and write a book about it and was forever confined to a sanitarium. His 300-year-old book, a rare and horrific tome tickling the paranormal fancies of those fortunate enough to "somehow" get their hands on it, now resides in the care of STEVEN TALBERT a 21st Century Film Major attending college. TALBERT is a chain-smoking, beer-drinking antihero of sorts-an outsider who hails from a struggling working class family who has his eyes set on CHASTITY BOCKNER-a beautiful, virgin blonde that embodies the upscale community of EVANSTON, IL. CHAZ, is a "promising" Pharmacology Major and is as "pretty as she is smart" but she's looking for love in all the wrong places. She and TALBERT meet in PROF. PALMERO's ill-fated ENGLISH class-a prerequisite course that puts them in the midst of the likes of WARREN, JESSICA, SHIMMY and NISHA (The Seeds of Promise) and "CHRIS"-CHRIS MAGOG! CHRIS MAGOG is a mysterious, handsome, intelligent, can-do and seemingly can-do-no-wrong "Poli-Sci Major" whose entrance into the lives of PROF. PALMERO's students prove to be as seductive as it is ultimately insidious. CHRIS MAGOG is the "new kid" in town who quickly becomes the "big man" on campus. Everybody loves CHRIS for their own "personal and individual" reasons, but no one seems to question why, except one: TALBERT. It is TALBERT's gravity, intuition and spiritual inclinations that will unlock the door to the dark and hellish secrets of the ethereal and esoteric CHRIS MAGOG. But will TALBERT's efforts be enough to close the 10,000 DOORS of HELL and ultimately save CHAZ-the woman he loves?</plot><plot>MAGOG is one of one-third of fallen angels relegated to the center of the Earth.
