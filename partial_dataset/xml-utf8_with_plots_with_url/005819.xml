<plot>When something goes bump in the night, most have the good sense to realise that it is little more than the radiator settling down. Jay on the other hand is a different matter. One clang in the pipes and he's convinced that someone has broken into his house with murder on their mind. With a bit of reassurance from loyal girlfriend Amy, he manages to settle down. Almost. Another creak from downstairs, and he's bolt upright and wide awake, and unfortunately so is Amy. Central heating? Perhaps. The cat? Maybe. But Jay's not so sure, and feeling it's his duty as a man, he heads downstairs to investigate.</plot><plot>When something goes bump in the night, most have the good sense to realise that it is little more than the radiator settling down.
