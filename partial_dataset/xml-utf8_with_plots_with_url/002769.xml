<plot>When a romantic vacation gets put on hold for a golf match, Betty feels her husband has gone too far. In an angered fervor, Betty heads out on the trip without him. From the road, Betty confronts her husband, Berry, about his decision to stay behind. 180 miles into her drive, she stops off at an isolated gas station to use the restroom. Betty meets a woman inside the bathroom, who gives Betty a new insight on her relationship with her husband. Bewildered by the turn-of-events, Betty is left with the decision to continue on the vacation alone, or return home and reschedule the plans.</plot><plot>When a romantic vacation gets put on hold for a golf match, Betty feels her husband has gone too far.
