<plot>A journey along electric power lines. The camera, pointed skyward, takes them out of the context of everyday perception, reducing them to form, to line. Right from the beginning the unadorned images seem almost abstract, they intersect the picture, occasionally the visual planes merge. The abstraction progresses slowly until solely graphic elements are recognizable. Sound and image were created in close cooperation, and the visual lines correspond to the music, are assimilated and reflected by it. .airE can be interpreted as a study of everyday perception, though on a different level it is also an essay on abstraction.</plot><plot>A journey along electric power lines.
