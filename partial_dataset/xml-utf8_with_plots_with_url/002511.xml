<plot>16 December, 1971 was the day when India won the war against Pakistan, and was also able to liberate Bangla Desh from Pakistan's rule. Although the ruling dictator of Pakistan surrendered unconditionally to India, some of the hard-lined Pakistani soldiers were bitter and angry at the surrender, as they wanted to continue fighting the Indians until their last breath. They retreated in silent and later came together to form their own groups of Jihaadi soldiers to carry out terrorists attacks against neighboring India. One of them was Dost Khan (Gulshan Grover). Although the Indian authorities were aware of Dost Khan's terrorist activities, they were unable to apprehend him as he kept changing disguises, and always kept one step ahead of the authorities. This matter was assigned to Chief of Revenue Intelligence Vir Vijay singh (Danny Denzongpa) and his team of Vikram (Milind Soman), Victor (Sushant Singh), and Sheeba (Dipanita Sharma). Their investigation led them to the conclusion that terrorists had been able to acquire a nuclear bomb, at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union, and that nuclear bomb is now in India's capital Delhi. 16th December is the deadline for the nuclear bomb to explode, however, Vir Vijay Singh and his team have not idea about the location of the bomb, nor of Dost Khan.</plot><plot>16 December, 1971 was the day when India won the war against Pakistan, and was also able to liberate Bangla Desh from Pakistan's rule.
