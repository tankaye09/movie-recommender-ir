<plot>In a pre-9/11 New York City, the two former Russian immigrants, Jenya and Andrey, have good reasons to be atheists, to espouse polygamous relationships and be convinced that the single source of all peoples' problems is a human propensity to believe in speculative unprovable causes including god, happiness, unconditional love, family values, human rights, etc. As our protagonists embark on a mission to embrace their lovers, friends and family members and in the same time open people's minds to realize that unexamined beliefs lead to dire consequences in life they find themselves being rejected time and again. Jenya and Andrey's failure to change human predisposition to happiness into pursuit of truth seems so profound and inescapable that they are forced to conclude that they simply belong to a different conscious species and decide to leave the human race - on September 11th, 2001.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007787</url></doc>
