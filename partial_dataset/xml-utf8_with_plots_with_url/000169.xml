<plot>This picture is the most dramatic of any of the series. It shows the complete maneuvers before starting and while crossing the line. The Columbia is seen putting about and executing the wonderful movement of Captain Barr to get into the Shamrock's wind. The Shamrock crosses the line a few seconds ahead of the Columbia, the Columbia having the leeward position. The boats were so close and so equally placed as to suggest one great composite single sticker, and Captain Barr cleverly comes about under the Shamrock's stern and gets across the line just a few seconds before the handicap gun, one minute and thirty-four seconds after the challenger. On going about the Columbia tacks a distance of about 300 yards from our camera and sails straight at us under a fifteen-knot breeze. The full height of the great mast and sails is over her deck. When she passes our camera she is not more than twenty-five feet away and the movements of the sailors as they scamper over the decks, pulling on the ropes and adjusting the great sails, make a most dramatic finish to the picture.</plot><plot>This picture is the most dramatic of any of the series.
