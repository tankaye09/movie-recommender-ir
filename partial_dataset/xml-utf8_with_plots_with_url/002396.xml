<plot>A woman in a slip is distressed - she's wringing her hands, she wears a wedding ring. It's cold, we can see her breath. She lights a cigarette lighter and sets afire some papers. She examines photographs on the mantle. She searches, franticly, among the shelved books. She calls 9-1-1. Partway into her conversation with the emergency dispatcher, the front door opens. Where is she? Who is she?</plot><plot>A woman in a slip is distressed - she's wringing her hands, she wears a wedding ring. It's cold, we can see her breath.
