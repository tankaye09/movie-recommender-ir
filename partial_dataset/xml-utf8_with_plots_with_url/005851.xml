<plot>Just minutes after losing the biggest game of the year, all-state receiver Bobby Makefield takes to the turf again in a one-on-one overtime shocker. Driven to the edge by his referee father, Bobby squares off against the winning team's golden boy-not to mention Mr. Makefield's newest protégé-Tommy Johnson. A dog-walker turned field general throws the game of his life, as Bobby performs a savage ballet, chopping feet and taking pain like the hard-muscle legends of yore. Come crunch time, the only thing standing between Bobby and victory is the half-man, half-Zebra on the sideline. When Bobby catches the winning touchdown, Mr. Makefield bombards him with flags, the last of which he slings at his face, declaring, "You're adopted." Here is the motivation behind seventeen years of abuse, including the latest injury: a blown call at that afternoon's championship game. Mr. Makefield penalizes Bobby ninety-nine yards for making his life miserable, but instead of kicking, the unfortunate son goes for it. On the game's final down, Bobby jukes Tommy out of his wardrobe, and the dog-walker-gunning to rewrite his own personal record book-launches a Brett Favre spiral. It appears the game is won until Bobby, following the course of his newly discovered blood, cuts across the field and lays a rib-bending, brain-rattling, self-affirming hit on his former dad. Staring down at Mr. Makefield, Bobby removes his helmet and proclaims, "Touchdown," whereupon he is violently tackled by the quarterback whose highlight he abandoned.</plot><plot>Just minutes after losing the biggest game of the year, all-state receiver Bobby Makefield takes to the turf again in a one-on-one overtime shocker.
