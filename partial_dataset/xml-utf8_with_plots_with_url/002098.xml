<plot>In rural Georgia, the Manning family has fallen on hard times. Forced into growing marijuana to support their failing farm after the death of his son Matt, Taylor Manning (Vincent Duvall), along with his wife Sandy (Helene Udy) and 17 year old daughter Elizabeth (Cara Walters) have attracted the attention of DEA agent Rusty Rozier (Jackson Walker). After being discovered posing as a wild-life photographer trespassing on her father's fields, Elizabeth befriends Agent Rozier and keeps his presence on the farm a secret. On December 24th, none of them could have imagined the nightmare about to unfold. 12 FL OZ is the story of one family's struggle to survive a direct attack on United States soil, and ultimately, each other. As the Manning family is forced to live with the direct consequences of their actions, they must put aside the differences between them in order to survive. Yet as they silently watch the world around them collapse, old wounds tear open, and bitter resentments claw at the delicate ties between these survivors. In director Dalton Harpe's gritty feature debut his no-holds-barred work promises to delight and horrify audiences.</plot><plot>In rural Georgia, the Manning family has fallen on hard times.
