<plot>"15 Waffles" is a series of connected vignettes that follows four New Yorkers as they lead their friends and family to their favorite breakfast joint. Each vignette begins a short while after the last one has ended, and the chain suggests that the restaurant is quickly adopted as a favorite by all who approach it: an eager romantic brings a skeptical coffee-shop clerk, who brings an earnest divorcé, who brings his son, who returns with his tragic Belgian girlfriend. Each story brings the audience closer to the ultimate breakfast and the discovery that the most special ingredient in the recipe is the trip to the table.</plot><plot>"15 Waffles" is a series of connected vignettes that follows four New Yorkers as they lead their friends and family to their favorite breakfast joint.
