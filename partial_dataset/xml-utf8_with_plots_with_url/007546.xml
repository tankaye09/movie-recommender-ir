<plot>When aspiring children's entertainer Jason Ackart gets his long-time crush Danny pregnant on their first date, the two choose to make a life together as husband and wife. With the support of church friends and family, Danny and Jason do their best to start out on the right foot, but as the prospect of fatherhood looms, Jason begins to realize the toll it may take on his career aspirations. He begins to pour all his focus into one last push to accomplish his dream of becoming an established children's entertainer before the baby is born. As a result, Danny feels insecure and ignored by Jason and begins to question whether their fledgling marriage can survive. Alienated from one another, Jason and Danny find themselves attracted to the attentions of other people. Jason meets Allison Flores, an intern at a local television station who wants to develop a children's show utilizing his talents, and Danny meets Nathan Long, a fine art photographer who goes out of his way to encourage Danny and give her confidence. As these new friendships begin to hint at the possibility of romance, Jason and Danny must decide whether they are willing to risk the future of their family for the indulgence of a moment's pleasure.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007546</url></doc>
