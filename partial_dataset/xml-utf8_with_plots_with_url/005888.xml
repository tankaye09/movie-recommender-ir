<plot>Five Card Stud is an intimate glimpse of a group of friends forced to face the cards they have been dealt. It is a story about love, life, and the consequences of war as seen through the eyes of five women. Kay, Lynn, Sue, Barb and Roxanne met at university and have been close friends ever since. Over the years as each woman's view on politics, power and belonging has grown and shifted, they have continued to get together for poker nights. When Roxanne 's protected world as a successful lawyer comes tumbling down, her friends are confronted with the reality of their own experiences of violence and war. From travel to countries crippled by conflict, to radical politics, to sexuality and self-hood, each woman brings to the table a unique perspective that bears witness to those forgotten in the aftermath of hostility and our incredible capacity for rebirth.</plot><plot>Five Card Stud is an intimate glimpse of a group of friends forced to face the cards they have been dealt.
