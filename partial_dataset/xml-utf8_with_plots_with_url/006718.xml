<plot>"Soldier laddies have the call at the present time, and we here produce one of New York's famous regiments. This is indeed an object lesson for the young who have heard a great deal about war but have never seen the boys in martial array. They look every inch the soldier, and although they are careworn and emaciated in some cases, still show their American patriotism, and are ready to battle again for freedom's cause. A splendid film."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006718</url></doc>
