<plot>A gruff highlander leaves his village and heads to the town and harbor where he will embark for Australia. We follow his descent to the sea through three stories. At first, he works with a blacksmith he knows, but his erotic attraction to the pure girlfriend of his friend puts him to flight. Later on, he meets a sensual tomboy who symbolizes all the enchantment of wild nature, and her destiny is to end up in a brothel. Finally, at the harbor of Piraeus, where he stays in the humble house of a couple who are separating, he meets a crestfallen woman, who is weary from poverty and abandonment, and together they take the ship of voluntary exile.</plot><plot>A gruff highlander leaves his village and heads to the town and harbor where he will embark for Australia.
