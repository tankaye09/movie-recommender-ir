<plot>100 Stories is literally that: one hundred quick back to back stories that jump between the lives of three main characters. We have Helen, who works at a Biotech company and who has recently discovered fine cooking. We have her boss, Marshall, an over-focused executive who is slowly losing grasp on reality and his life. And we have Brian, a socially engaged bike messenger whose thoughts are blurring the line between activism and terrorism. All three are desperately trying to give some sort of shape to their lives, they are all, in essence, trying to write their story, and in this striving are actually dramatically altering the lives of those who come into contact with them.</plot><plot>100 Stories is literally that: one hundred quick back to back stories that jump between the lives of three main characters.
