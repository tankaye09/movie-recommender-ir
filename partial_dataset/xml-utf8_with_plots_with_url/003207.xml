<plot>Chronicling the trials and tribulations of three young Tamil men. A bright underachiever, the impressionable 23-year old Anpu, who lives with his no-nonsense disciplinarian father. Trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of isolation, Anpu finds salvation with a local gang. A charismatic gang leader Kumar, who maintains a strong sense of comradely and a code of honour among his members. Gang life is not something he enjoys nor he chose, but circumstances forced him into it and he is waiting for an opportune time to get out. And, far removed from them is an ambitious student Ahilan, who has managed to surmount enormous challenges in life through his positive outlook and determination. They have treaded very different paths in their lives, yet their fates become inexorably tied to each other's. Anpu's involvement in Kumar's gang blossoms into a strong friendship between the two, based on trust and respect. Former classmates and friends, Ahilan and Anpu have grown distant over time due to a girl in their lives. These young men's stories couldn't be more different, yet one thread links them all. All of them are victims of the brutal civil war in Sri Lanka. That fateful bright Saturday starts like any other, and no one could have predicted the chain of events that are about to unfold that will change their lives forever.</plot><plot>Chronicling the trials and tribulations of three young Tamil men.
