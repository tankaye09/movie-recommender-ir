<plot>Introduces us to Scott Willis, a 21st-century man. A doctor reviews his health and attributes, which are average or above, then Scott takes over, advertising himself as the man who can father your child, a man of the new century with twenty-first-century sperm. Scott first addresses lesbian couples who want to have a child. His mother vouches for him, then she digresses about herself, Scott's father, and Scotty's conception. Then Scott talks about his love for his father, a man he never met, which brings him back to his sales pitch. He argues for simultaneous, dual impregnation - Scott's version of male fantasy. Women of the world, unite; say hello to a new century. Everybody wins.</plot><plot>Introduces us to Scott Willis, a 21st-century man.
