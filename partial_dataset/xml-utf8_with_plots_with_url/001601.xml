<plot>The first commercially available movie in the United States aired on Broadway in New York City on April 14, 1894. The footage shown there was viewed through a narrow slot in a former shoe store. This short film celebrates the first 100 years of American movies from that time. With certain themes often tying them together, clips from landmark American movies are shown in somewhat chronological order, the clips played over an orchestral score, which is often itself based on landmark movie scores. Seventeen movies are specially mentioned, these seventeen perhaps not the best or most influential movies, but rather ones that provide insight to movies from that era.</plot><plot>The first commercially available movie in the United States aired on Broadway in New York City on April 14, 1894.
