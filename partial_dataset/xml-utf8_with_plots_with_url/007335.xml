<plot>"Papa Smith and his family have just moved into a new house. Papa Smith is attempting to put up the stove-pipe, with the assistant of Mrs. Smith and little Willie. He proceeds with ordinary luck until he comes to the elbow at the top of the pipe, when an unfortunate slip precipitates about a half bushel of soot into his face. The scene is very well worked out and very laughable."</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?007335</url></doc>
