<plot>Made in the immediate aftermath of a recent tragedy in southwestern Montana, 200 Block is a documentary meditation on history-in-progress in a small Western city. Many small towns in the U.S. are experiencing a collapse of their downtown areas. However, on March 5, 2009, this figurative collapse took on a visceral reality for Bozeman, MT, when a morning explosion destroyed several buildings in its historic downtown. This film explores the emotional climate of Bozeman in the days following this disaster.</plot><plot>Made in the immediate aftermath of a recent tragedy in southwestern Montana, 200 Block is a documentary meditation on history-in-progress in a small Western city.
