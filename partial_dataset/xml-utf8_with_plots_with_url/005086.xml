<plot>Keke, Gwen and Olin are close friends who started their friendship since high school. Together, as they reached university, the three girls lived in the house of Olin's parent. The three of them had chosen different subjects. But, most importantly is that after uni, it is part of their routine to hang out in a pizza café, rent home videos and watched movies together at home. One night, as they were watching the romantic scene in "Titanic", their hearts got touched. They realized that all these days, they have been missing and neglecting something that is very important and that is LOVE. The only male that seems to enjoy their company is Bono, their neighbour. The next day, they were being called "the lesbians" by their enemy gang lead by an envious high-profile girl named Barbara whose boobs are enlarged by the process of silicon injection. Because of this, the girls thought that they have enough, therefore they tried out a few ideas to get a lover. Instead of finding love, certain things became wrecked including their friendship which leads them to conduct a betting. The bet is for them to find love in 30 days. The winner will be served by the loser, while the loser will be the eternal servant of the winner.</plot><plot>Keke, Gwen and Olin are close friends who started their friendship since high school.
