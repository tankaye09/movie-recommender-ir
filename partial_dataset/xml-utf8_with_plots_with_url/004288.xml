<plot>24 Frames is a stop-motion animated black comedy mockumentary about a stop-motion animated film production at an art college in the southern U.S. The crew, which consists mainly of ambitious animation students, aspires to adapt a children's book into an animated film to impress the school's president, who also happens to be the director's mother-in-law, and the author of the book. Personality clashes, artistic differences, and a series of grisly mishaps soon cause the production to spiral out of control as the would-be filmmakers struggle to finish the project.</plot><plot>24 Frames is a stop-motion animated black comedy mockumentary about a stop-motion animated film production at an art college in the southern U.S. The crew, which consists mainly of ambitious animation students, aspires to adapt a children's book into an animated film to impress the school's president, who also happens to be the director's mother-in-law, and the author of the book.
