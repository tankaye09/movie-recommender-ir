<plot>The Britannia Awards are the highest accolade that BAFTA/LA offers, and are presented in a unique awards ceremony. Unlike their sister awards, the BAFTAs, which look only at the current crop of films, the Britannia awards instead honour a select group of individuals or companies who have made a difference in the film and television industry. The LA Chapter selects four recipients each year, and honours them in the November ceremony. Each year four awards are presented: Artistic Excellence, Contributions to Worldwide Entertainment, Excellence in Film, and Lifetime Achievement in Television &amp; Film. Previous winners have included Michael Caine, Martin Scorsese, Anthony Hopkins, Bob &amp; Harvey Weinstein, Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.</plot><plot>The Britannia Awards are the highest accolade that BAFTA/LA offers, and are presented in a unique awards ceremony.
