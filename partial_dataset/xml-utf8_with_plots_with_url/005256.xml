<plot>China Town, with all its tinsel and glamor, is located in Goa, India, a major tourist attraction because of it's scenic beauty and casinos. Chief Inspector Karan of Goa Police is told that an anonymous phone call has been received informing that the owner of 36 China Town as well as the owner of Hollywood Casino, Sonia Chang, has been murdered. When the Police rush to the site, they do not find any dead body, but instead several hand and foot prints, including those of aspiring Bollywood actor, Raj Malhotra; a runaway daughter, Priya; an addictive gambler and hotel owner, Natwar, and his wife, Gracy; a visitor from Bombay, K.K., and his wife Ruby; a local playboy and hunk, Rocky. In addition to these, the Police also have to question Lobo, the butler, and his wife, who claim they were away at the time of the crime; and last but not the least Mr.Dixit, Mrs. Chang's lawyer. What Karan finds is that all of these suspects are lying about their whereabouts at the time of the victim's death, and all have sufficient motive to kill Sonia, and it will be up to him to discern the truth from the lies, and not only figure out the real killer but also find sufficient evidence linking him to this crime.</plot><plot>China Town, with all its tinsel and glamor, is located in Goa, India, a major tourist attraction because of it's scenic beauty and casinos.
