<plot>A middle-aged British couple are scheduled to go off on a holiday cruise in the Mediterranean. The husband, a businessman staunch in his beliefs, settled in his ways, with a dryly humorous approach to life in general, and a Britisher's inbred disdain for foreign travel, decides they will settle for a British seaside holiday. Meanwhile, back in their London suburb, their daughter and her fiancée have grown tired of their long engagement and have decided to 'play marriage.' The parents return to find that some changes have been made in their absence.</plot><plot>A middle-aged British couple are scheduled to go off on a holiday cruise in the Mediterranean.
