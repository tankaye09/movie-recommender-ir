<plot>Our human make up is such that everyone on the face of the planet longs to believe in something. Freud called it the "God-hole" and never before has this hole been so wide and deep. In Western culture today, many people have lives that from the outside look complete - house, family and career all in order but something is missing, something truly spiritual calls to them. 5 Seekers is a six-part reality/documentary series that takes a small group of compelling characters on a journey to try and fill that hole. Guided by host Ralph Benmergui, our eager group of five women and men, travel to some of the most spiritually attuned places in the world and come in close contact with new ideas, great teachers and exciting experiences They also come in contact with some obscure and fringe practices that inspire irreverence amidst the reverence.</plot><plot>Our human make up is such that everyone on the face of the planet longs to believe in something.
