<plot>A film series about three people trapped in a room of a house with the address 1953. The year is 1953, and the time is 19:53. Inspired by Sartre's play, "No Exit" this surreal tale explores the disturbing nature of a person conflicted with their identity and how other's perceive them. Laced with absurd conversations, heated and pointless arguments, and creepy confusion. Susie, Dorothy and Bob have found themselves caught in a world that is far removed from the year 1953, and as they blindly forge through the day trapped in their house they find their world has become a place of electric wires criss-crossing through a sky polluted with black soot and the faint smell of burning chemicals.</plot><plot>A film series about three people trapped in a room of a house with the address 1953.
