<plot>For thousands of years, scholars, mystics and philosophers have marvelled over The Messiah, The Prophecised Saviour of Mankind...The Mahdi; who will bring back to the world the dying values of truth, peace and justice. Following the tragic death of his older brother, troubled seventeen year old Layth Ali finds himself on the wrong side of the law and soon discovers his only way out is his hard-line orthodox Principal, AliHusain Hakimi - Head of The Islamic College. Given only two weeks to complete an assignment on a subject the young rebel refuses to believe in, Layth seeks the help of Mohsin, an unusual, mystical Shaykh, who catapults him into a world of spiritual discovery, faith and understanding.</plot><plot>For thousands of years, scholars, mystics and philosophers have marvelled over The Messiah, The Prophecised Saviour of Mankind...The Mahdi; who will bring back to the world the dying values of truth, peace and justice.
