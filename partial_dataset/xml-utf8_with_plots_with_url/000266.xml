<plot>A provocative and entertaining look at big city Mayor John Hickenlooper (whom Time Magazine rated as one of the top five mayors in the nation) as he keeps his town together during the Democratic National Convention and deals with everything from bomb threats to assassination plots to overly eager marijuana enthusiasts to stray dogs. This is a fun documentary that puts a very human face on public service.</plot><plot>A provocative and entertaining look at big city Mayor John Hickenlooper (whom Time Magazine rated as one of the top five mayors in the nation) as he keeps his town together during the Democratic National Convention and deals with everything from bomb threats to assassination plots to overly eager marijuana enthusiasts to stray dogs.
