<plot>CAMERON arranges a surprise party for his father's 75th birthday. His siblings arrive at the family's Beverly Hills mansion with plenty of personal baggage, and a few pieces of luggage in tow. His sister THERESA, a struggling actress living in New York - and her husband CLARK, an afflicted loser with a voracious addiction for on-line auctions are the first to arrive. Cameron's bitter, pothead, adopted brother MICKEY unexpectedly returns from a fifteen year absence, with a mysterious GIRL as his companion. But a late-night telephone call from the police permanently alters their weekend plans, and this three-day weekend exposes everything this dysfunctional 'family' has to offer: love, loss, pain, happiness, betrayal, and most of all...truth.</plot><plot>CAMERON arranges a surprise party for his father's 75th birthday.
