<plot>10 Days in Malawi takes the point-of-view of a group of American medical aid and orphan care volunteers traveling to this new and exciting land. Through the experiences of these volunteers, we witness the needs of the Malawian people, such as when a crowd at the medical clinic becomes so large and desperate that the workers have to shut the clinic down. Yet we also witness the beauty of the Malawian people through their joy, culture, and generosity towards their guests. While we are often presented with such a one-sided and fatalistic view of life in Sub-Saharan African, 10 Days in Malawi reminds us that it's these complexities that ensure that this land is not a place abandoned by hope.</plot><plot>10 Days in Malawi takes the point-of-view of a group of American medical aid and orphan care volunteers traveling to this new and exciting land.
