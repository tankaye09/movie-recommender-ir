<plot>Connie, a Mormon girl, is determined to marry Ron despite her parents opposition due to his religious faith. Their bishop advises Connie that unlike those who have passed away, she might be giving up her chance for an eternal marriage by marrying outside a Mormon temple. When Ron wants a friend, who entered the ministry of his faith, to marry them in another town, Connie reluctantly agrees but finds herself at the doorstep of her Aunt Jane in the middle of the night tearfully explaining that when she was told that their children would have to be raised in Ron's faith, she could not go through with it. Aunt Jane, who married a non-Mormon, affirms that Connie made a courageous and correct choice.</plot><plot>Connie, a Mormon girl, is determined to marry Ron despite her parents opposition due to his religious faith.
