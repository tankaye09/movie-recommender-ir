<plot>It's been 30 years since a biker movie was a box-office hit in Australia but if film maker Martin Brown succeeds it won't be too much longer before we see a big budget biker film based on the 1984 Milperra massacre. 1% One Percenters Search For A Screenplay is a documentary that follows Brown's almost masochistic attempt to develop a feature film about the Milperra biker massacre that took place in suburban Sydney on Father's Day, 1984. On that day, two rival outlaw biker clubs, the Comancheros and the Bandidos, engaged in open warfare at the Viking Tavern. After a violent shoot-out in the pub car park in full view of terrified members of the public, six bikers and a 15-year-old girl lay dead. Film maker Martin Brown has had a rich and varied career in the entertainment industry including a 10-year association with BAFTA winning director Baz Luhrmann as art director for Strictly Ballroom, co-producer of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet and lead producer of Moulin Rouge. Brown knows there is a "gripping human story" behind the Milperra Massacre and he plans to tell this story in a multi-million dollar feature film titled 'Brothers in Arms'. 1% One Percenters follows Brown's perilous journey as he tries to uncover the truth about what happened on that fatal day. Until now this event has been off limits to film makers. 1% One Percenters trails Brown as he searches for the right director, the right screenwriter and enough funds to bring the true story about Milperra to the big screen. Among the people Brown meets are Comanchero president and Milperra survivor 'Jock' Ross, Bandido vice president 'Bullets', Bandido Milperra survivor 'Porky', Lee Denholm, the girlfriend of 'Snodgrass' the Bandido leader at Milperra, ex Bandido Milperra survivor 'Caesar' Campbell and investigating police officer ex superintendent Ron Stephenson. Witnessing these meetings, the documentary is able to reveal the story behind Milperra for the first time on television. By documenting his journey and incorporating archive film of the massacre and interviews with bikers, witnesses and police 1% One Percenters Search For A Screenplay provides a unique insight into one of the seminal events in Australian social history</plot><plot>It's been 30 years since a biker movie was a box-office hit in Australia but if film maker Martin Brown succeeds it won't be too much longer before we see a big budget biker film based on the 1984 Milperra massacre. 1% One Percenters Search For A Screenplay is a documentary that follows Brown's almost masochistic attempt to develop a feature film about the Milperra biker massacre that took place in suburban Sydney on Father's Day, 1984.
