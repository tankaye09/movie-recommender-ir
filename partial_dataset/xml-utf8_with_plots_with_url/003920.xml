<plot>The International Gay Film Awards is the only award show to recognize and celebrate gay themed theatrical motion pictures films that have had limited theatrical releases and have been overlooked by the main stream awards shows. These films and works of arts, strong in content, original in themes and defiant to society's expectations is what has made the independent vision of filmmaking what it is today. By changing perceptions of gay life and enhancing the community's visibility worldwide through film, the independent gay films nominated challenge people's ideas of what's normal and accepted. The Award show is held yearly in Hollywood. The event will be an evening to celebrate the theatres, film festivals, distributors, filmmakers, financiers and stars who have contributed in bringing these stories to audiences worldwide. Presenters of the Awards will be celebrities and filmmakers from the independent film community. The awards show seeks to acknowledge the contribution of the filmmakers and the people who help bring these stories to theatres. This select number of films are paving the way for creating understanding and showing the world in many ways that life is full of diversity and many of these stories touch us through the human aspect of our own personal relationships.</plot><plot>The International Gay Film Awards is the only award show to recognize and celebrate gay themed theatrical motion pictures films that have had limited theatrical releases and have been overlooked by the main stream awards shows.
