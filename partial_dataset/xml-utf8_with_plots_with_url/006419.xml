<plot>Moments after the shooting in the Louisiana State Capitol stopped, Huey Long's assailant, Dr. Carl Weiss, was riddled with 60 bullets. Louisiana Senator Huey Long was dead 30 hours later. It was 1935. Dr. Weiss' son, Carl Weiss Jr., was 3 months old. Now, 74 years later, Weiss Jr. is on a mission to recover a bullet (the 61st) from Huey Long's buried body, overturn history and clear his family's name before it's too late. How does a son try to love a father he never had? How does a family find closure over the stigma of an assassination? How is history written? Will the Weiss family have the chance to change it? And who killed Huey Long?</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?006419</url></doc>
