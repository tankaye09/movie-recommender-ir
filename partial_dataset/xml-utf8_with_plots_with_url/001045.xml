<plot>A child, Pacheco, has a phobia of small animals (insects, worms, lizards and so on). His father, in an attempt to help him get over his phobia, exposes him to a very unusual therapy: he makes him sleep with some of these animals closed in a jar and kept in the house. In this way, Pacheco slowly gets used to contact with the animals and is finally able to overcome his initial repugnance to the point of even feeling affection for them. So much so that the final result goes way over his father's wildest expectations.</plot><plot>A child, Pacheco, has a phobia of small animals (insects, worms, lizards and so on).
