<plot>"5 Day Scam" is a situational comedy about a mix of nutty people that come together in an environment of peculiar provincial show business of a developing country, each of them craving for fame and riches. Vilnius, the capital of a small country on the outskirts of Europe welcomes Eros Giannakakis, a "rich and famous" producer from Greece, battling his middle age crises. He comes seeking new talent for a European TV show.  At the casting of local dilettante musicians Eros meets young "wanna be a singer" Egle. She is neither the most talented nor the best, but she takes his breath away and that is what counts. While Eros is willing to do anything to win her over there is a bunch of players each scheming his own plot against Eros. Local TV producer Liepa is trying to seduce the Greek, her strange irrational assistant Julian is seeking the rich and famous producer's attention, Egle's wimpy boyfriend Andrius is ready to fight Eros for Egle, and then there is the Greek producer's very temperamental Russian wife Natali!  </plot><plot>"5 Day Scam" is a situational comedy about a mix of nutty people that come together in an environment of peculiar provincial show business of a developing country, each of them craving for fame and riches.
