<plot>The result of spiritual desperation, jealous vengeance, and misanthropic madness: three tales of horror. In SCREAM FOR ME one killer becomes the victim of another more brutal and insane than even himself. In MY SKIN! Death flies in to collect the soul of a murdered young woman, but first takes revenge on her killer. And finally, with HUMAN NO MORE, a private detective consumed by an irreconcilable murder case descends into his caustic underworld one last time.</plot><plot>The result of spiritual desperation, jealous vengeance, and misanthropic madness: three tales of horror.
